Question: There is well of depth 30m and frog is at bottom of the well. He jumps 3m up one day and falls back 2m down the same day. How many days will it take for the frog to come out of the well?
Choices:
  A: 25 days
  B: 26 days
  C: 27 days
  D: 28 days
  E: 29 days
Response 0:

Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?

Topic: Math
Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let the number of copper coins be X and the number of brass coins are Y
  We know that for each copper coin, she gets 20 cents or $0.20
  We also know that for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents or $0.25
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40
  Therefore, we can write the equation 0.20X + 0.25Y = 3.40
  We want to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, so we need to minimize X
  Dividing both sides of the equation by 0.20, we get X + 1.25Y = 17
  Since Y is a positive integer, X must be at least 3
  The minimum number of copper coins she brought is 3
  Therefore, the answer is B: 3
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
My previous answer was incorrect. 
Here's the correct approach:
Thought:
1.  **Convert the total amount to cents:** $3.40 = 340 cents
2.  **Set up the equation:** 
    *   Let X be the number of copper coins.
    *   Let Y be the number of brass coins.
    *   The total value of copper coins is 20X cents.
    *   The total value of brass coins is 25Y cents.
    *   The total value of all coins is 340 cents.
    *   Therefore, we have the equation: 20X + 25Y = 340.
3.  **Find the minimum value of X:**
    *   We want to minimize X while keeping Y a non-negative integer (since you can't have negative coins).
    *   Divide both sides of the equation by 5: 4X + 5Y = 68.
    *   Notice that 4X must be a multiple of 4, as it is the sum of 4 times an integer (X).
    *   The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 68 is 72.
    *   Therefore, 4X = 72, and X = 18.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 18.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 2:
My previous responses contained mistakes. Here´s the corrected analysis:
Thought:
1. Convert the total amount to cents: $3.40 = 340 cents.
2. Set up the equation: 
    * Let X be the number of copper coins.
    * Let Y be the number of brass coins.
    * The total value of copper coins is 20X cents.
    * The total value of brass coins is 25Y cents.
    * The total value of all coins is 340 cents.
    * Therefore, we have the equation: 20X + 25Y = 340.
3. Find the minimum value of X:
    * We want to minimize X while keeping Y a non-negative integer (since you can't have negative coins).
    * Divide both sides of the equation by 5: 4X + 5Y = 68.
    * Notice that 4X must be a multiple of 4 because it is the sum of 4 times an integer (X).
    * The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 68 is 72.
    * Therefore, 4X = 72, and X = 18.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 18.
Action: Answer("A") 
Response 3:
I apologize for the repeated errors in my previous responses. Here is the correct solution:
**Step 1: Convert the total amount to cents.**
$3.40 = 340$ cents
**Step 2: Set up the equation.**
Let:
* $x$ be the number of copper coins
* $y$ be the number of brass coins
The total value of copper coins is $20x$ cents.
The total value of brass coins is $25y$ cents.
The total value of all coins is $340$ cents.
Therefore, we have the equation:
$20x + 25y = 340$
**Step 3: Find the minimum value of x.**
We want to minimize $x$ while keeping $y$ a non-negative integer (since you can't have negative coins).
**Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 5.**
$4x + 5y = 68$
Notice that $4x$ must be a multiple of 4 because it is the sum of 4 times an integer ($x$).
**Step 5: Identify the smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 68.**
The smallest multiple of 4 that is greater than or equal to 68 is 72.
Therefore, $4x = 72$ and $x = 18$.
**Conclusion:**
The minimum number of copper coins the coin-diver brought is **18**.

  Let x = the original price.
  After a 30% reduction, the price becomes 0.7x.
  To increase the price by 100%, we need to multiply 0.7x by a factor of 2 (since 100% = 1 + 0.5 = 2).
  So, the final price would be 0.7x * 2 = 1.4x.
  The percentage increase is (1.4x - x)/x * 100% = 40%.

  Let's find out what reduced part of the ribbon.
  Ratio means that the ribbon was divided into 5 + 3 = 8 parts.
  So each part is 30 cm / 8 = 3.75 cm.
  The ribbon was reduced by 3 x 3.75 cm = 11.25 cm.
  The new length of the ribbon is 30 cm - 11.25 cm = 18.75 cm.
  Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 18.75 cm.

Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The research findings suggest that the meteorites are about 200 million years old.
  The high concentration of iridium and platinum in the clay layer is consistent with the impact of a large meteorite.
  The presence of marine plankton fossils in the strata indicates that the impact occurred in the ocean.
  The statement that elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface (C) supports the research findings by providing additional evidence for the extraterrestrial origin of the meteorites.
  The other statements are not as directly relevant to the research findings.

Topic: Logic
Context: The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.There is no other explanation.The fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, For example, Qiangua is the heaven, and Qian is the ancient Chinese character, so it is named Qian; in the sense of meaning, the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun is the meaning of suppleness
Question: Which of the following statements is true, which most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name?
Choices:
  A: The reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names
  C: Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings
  D: The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse.At the beginning, he had three elephants.He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.
Response 0:
## Analysing the Statements and Traditional View:
**Traditional View:**
* The Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams names in Zhouyi are fictional with no meaning.
* No other explanation is provided.
**Statements:**
* **A:** 
    * **Supports:** This aligns with the traditional view of Qian representing heaven and Kun representing earth, but doesn't necessarily refute the lack of meaning.
    * **Against:** Doesn't address the claim of fictional origin or provide other explanations.
* **B:** 
    * **Supports:** This acknowledges the limitations of both fetching images and fetching meanings theories individually, implying that a more nuanced explanation is needed.
    * **Against:** Doesn't directly refute the traditional view but weakens its stance by showing its insufficiency.
* **C:** 
    * **Against:** This reinforces the traditional view by acknowledging the existence of multiple explanations, even though they might be limited to fetching images or meanings.
* **D:** 
    * **Supports:** This directly contradicts the traditional view by claiming that the name "Kun" has a specific meaning and origin related to a story.
    * **Against:** Doesn't address the origin of other hexagram names or whether the story is factual.
## Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, statement **D** most seriously shakes the traditional view because it directly contradicts its core claim by presenting a concrete example of a hexagram name having a specific meaning and origin story. While it doesn't completely disprove the traditional view, it significantly weakens its position and opens the door for further investigation into the origin of the Gua names.
Therefore, the answer is:
**Action: Answer("D")**

Response 5:
## Analysis of Statements and Traditional View:
**Traditional View:**
* The origin of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams names in Zhouyi is fictional or meaningless.
* No other explanation is offered.
* The fiction states that:
    * Eight Diagrams are named after objects (e.g., Qian representing heaven).
    * Hexagram names represent principles through their images (e.g., Kun representing suppleness).
**Statements:**
* **A:**
    * **Supports:** Aligns with the traditional view of Qian and Kun representing specific concepts.
    * **Doesn't refute:** Doesn't address the claim of fictional or meaningless origins.
* **B:**
    * **Supports:** Acknowledges limitations of both "fetching images" and "fetching meanings" theories, hinting at a more nuanced explanation.
    * **Against:** Weakens the traditional view but doesn't directly contradict it.
* **C:**
    * **Against:** Reinforces the traditional view by acknowledging various explanations, even if limited to specific theories.
* **D:**

Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
Response 0:

  A: the second week
  B: Fourth week
  C: fifth week
  D: Seventh week
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Given: S is scheduled for the sixth week.
   Analysis of options:
    A. Second Week: If R were to be scheduled in the second week, then condition (4) would be violated, as F and J cannot be performed in two consecutive weeks if R takes the second slot. 
    B. Fourth Week:  If R were scheduled in the fourth week, it would violate condition (2), as O and S cannot perform continuously, and S is already scheduled for the sixth week.

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.
Response 0:
## Analyzing Li Ming's Rebuttal:
Li Ming argues that falling prices won't improve the economy because unemployed people lack the means to increase consumption. 
## Analyzing Answer Choices:
* **A:** This supports Zhang Qiang by suggesting increased hiring and spending after the economy improves, aligning with his argument about price reductions leading to economic recovery.
* **B:** This is irrelevant to the argument. Consumer confidence alone doesn't guarantee increased spending, especially when unemployed.
* **C:** This weakens Li Ming's argument by highlighting that even during economic decline, essential spending continues, offering a potential source of demand.
* **D:** This contradicts Li Ming by suggesting unemployed people have savings for consumption during low prices, contradicting their claim about lacking resources.
## Conclusion:
The answer that weakens Li Ming's argument most effectively is **C**. By highlighting continued essential spending during economic decline, it provides a potential source of demand even when unemployment is high, undermining Li Ming's claim that low prices won't stimulate the economy due to a lack of spending power among the unemployed.
Therefore, the best answer is: 
**Action: Answer("C")**

Topic: Logic
Context: Oxford University in the United Kingdom is full of a free discussion and free debate atmosphere, and questioning and challenging become the norm in academic research.There is even such an exaggeration that if you have been to Oxford University, you will never be able to believe any words that anyone said.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following statements must be false?
Choices:
  A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.
  B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.
  C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.
  D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.
Response 0:
Thought:
- The statement describes that questioning and challenging become the norm in Oxford University.
- This implies that one should be skeptical and not blindly believe everything they hear.
- Option A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said. This aligns with the spirit of critical thinking promoted in Oxford.
- Option B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say. This aligns with the idea that skepticism should be applied judiciously, and not every statement should be rejected outright.
- Option C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said. This is an extreme interpretation of the statement and contradicts the idea of reasoned skepticism.
- Option D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say. This is a more moderate interpretation but still implies a complete loss of trust in any statement, which is not necessarily the case.
Therefore, the statement that must be false is:

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought: 
There are 9 buildings in total, 3 for each company.
There are 3 classes of buildings, each company has at least one building from each class.
The Garza Tower and the Flores Tower are both class 1.
If RealProp owns the Garza Tower, then it must trade it for another class 1 building.
The only other class 1 building is the Flores Tower.
If Southco owns the Flores Tower, then it cannot trade it with RealProp for the Garza Tower.
Therefore, RealProp cannot own the Garza Tower.
Answer: B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("B")

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Thought:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, let's start by considering the options.
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Knutson. This can't work because Gonzalez and Knutson can't both be assigned to Silva.
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck. This could work. Frost and Heideck are assigned together, and Gonzalez is not assigned to Silva.
  C: Gonzalez and Knutson. This can't work because Knutson can't be assigned to Silva.
  D: Heideck and Lai. This can't work because Frost is not assigned to Silva.
  E: Knutson and Mays. This can't work because Knutson can't be assigned to Silva.
  Therefore, the only option that works is B: Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
My apologies! I made a mistake in my previous response. Here is the correct answer:
The manager must assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
Frost and Heideck must be together at one ceremony.
If Gonzalez is at Silva, then Lai must be at Thorne.
If Knutson is not at Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be at Thorne.
Let's analyze the options:
A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - This does not work because Frost and Heideck are together at Silva, violating the constraint that no photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies.
B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - This does not fulfill the requirement of having at least two photographers at Thorne as only Gonzalez is assigned there.
C: Gonzalez, Knutson - This does not work because Frost and Heideck are not together in either ceremony.
D: Heideck, Lai - This does not work because it lacks two photographers at Silva as required.
E: Knutson, Mays - This satisfies all constraints:
    * At least two photographers are assigned to each ceremony (Knutson and Mays to Thorne, Frost and Heideck to Silva).
    * Frost and Heideck are together at Silva.
    * If Gonzalez is not at Silva (he is not), there is no requirement for Lai to be at Thorne.
    * If Knutson is not at Thorne (he is not), then both Heideck and Mays are assigned to Thorne (they are).
Therefore, the correct answer is E: Knutson, Mays.
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 2:
My apologies for the previous incorrect answers. Here is the correct analysis and answer:
Requirement: Atleast two photographers at each ceremony.
**Constraint 1:** Frost and Heideck must be together.
**Constraint 2:** If Gonzalez is at Silva, then Lai must be at Thorne.
**Constraint 3:** If Knutson is not at Thorne, then both Heideck and Mays must be at Thorne.
Let's analyze the options:
**A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson:** 
* Violates the requirement of two photographers at Thorne as only Knutson is assigned there.
* Satisfies Constraint 1 and Constraint 2.
**B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:**
* Violates the requirement of two photographers at Thorne.
* Satisfies Constraint 1 and Constraint 2.
**C: Gonzalez, Knutson:**
* Violates Constraint 1 as they cannot be together.
**D: Heideck, Lai:**
* Violates the requirement of two photographers at Silva.
* Violates Constraint 1.
**E: Knutson, Mays:**
* **Meets the requirement:** Two photographers are assigned to Silva (Knutson and Mays) and Thorne (Frost and Heideck).
* **Satisfies Constraint 1:** Frost and Heideck are together at Silva.
* **Satisfies Constraint 2:** Gonzalez is not at Silva, so Lai's assignment is irrelevant.
* **Satisfies Constraint 3:** Knutson is not at Thorne, so both Heideck and Mays are assigned to it.
Therefore, only option E, "Knutson, Mays," fulfills all requirements and constraints.

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Let's analyze the information step by step:
* **Wall Assignments:**
    * Isaacs's watercolor: Wall 2
    * Franz's oil: Wall 3 
* **Restrictions:**
    * No wall with only watercolors.
    * No wall with only one student's work.
    * No wall with both Franz and Isaacs.
**Reasoning:**
* Since Isaacs's watercolor is on Wall 2, her oil cannot be on the same wall due to the restriction of not having only watercolors on a wall. 
* Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be on either Wall 1 or Wall 4.
* Franz's oil is on Wall 3. Due to the restriction of not having both Franz and Isaacs on the same wall, Franz's watercolor cannot be on Wall 4 (where Isaacs's oil is).
* Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be on either Wall 1 or Wall 2.
Now let's consider the remaining choices:
* **Greene:** We know Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed (which we established is either Wall 1 or Wall 3). 
* **Hidalgo:** We have no direct information about Hidalgo's paintings.
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A: Franz's watercolor:** This could be on Wall 1 or Wall 2, fitting the restrictions and information.
* **B: Greene's oil:** We don't know where this is located.
* **C: Greene's watercolor:** As mentioned above, this must be on the same wall as Franz's oil, which could be Wall 1 or Wall 3.
* **D: Hidalgo's oil:** We have no information about this painting's location.
* **E: Hidalgo's watercolor:** We have no information about this painting's location.
**Conclusion:**
Both A and C are possible options based on the given information and restrictions. We cannot definitively determine which one is displayed on Wall 1 without further clues.
Therefore, the answer must be the option that encompasses both possibilities A and C.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
Response 1:
I apologize, I made a mistake in my previous analysis. Let's re-examine the information:
* **Wall Assignments:**
    * Isaacs's watercolor: Wall 2
    * Franz's oil: Wall 3 
* **Restrictions:**
    * No wall with only watercolors.
    * No wall with only one student's work.
    * No wall with both Franz and Isaacs.
**Reasoning:**
* Since Isaacs's watercolor is on Wall 2, her oil cannot be on the same wall due to the restriction of not having only watercolors on a wall. 
* Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be on either Wall 1 or Wall 4.
* Franz's oil is on Wall 3. Due to the restriction of not having both Franz and Isaacs on the same wall, Franz's watercolor cannot be on Wall 4 (where Isaacs's oil is).
* Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be on either Wall 1 or Wall 2.
Now let's consider the remaining choices:
* **Greene:** We know Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the wall where Franz's oil is displayed (which we established is either Wall 1 or Wall 3). 
* **Hidalgo:** We have no direct information about Hidalgo's paintings.
**Analysis of Choices:**
* **A: Franz's watercolor:** This could be on Wall 1 or Wall 2, fitting the restrictions and information.
* **B: Greene's oil:** We don't know where this is located.
* **C: Greene's watercolor:** This must be on the same wall as Franz's oil, which could be Wall 1 or Wall 3.
* **D: Hidalgo's oil:** We have no information about this painting's location.
* **E: Hidalgo's watercolor:** We have no information about this painting's location.
**Conclusion:**
Both A and C are possible options based on the given information and restrictions. We cannot definitively determine which one is displayed on Wall 1 without further clues.
Therefore, the answer must be the option that encompasses both possibilities A and C.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
Response 2:
I apologize for the previous mistakes in the analysis. Let's break it down clearly:
* **Given:**
    * Walls: 1, 2, 3, 4
    * Artists: Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs
    * Each artist has one oil and one watercolor.
    * Two paintings per wall, one above and one below.
    * Restrictions:
        * No wall with only watercolors.
        * No wall with only one artist's work.
        * No wall with both Franz and Isaacs.
    * Specifics:
        * Isaacs's watercolor on Wall 2.
        * Franz's oil on Wall 3.
        * Greene's watercolor is above Franz's oil.
        * Isaacs's oil is below another painting on Wall 4.
* **Analysis:**
    1. **Isaacs's oil:** Since it cannot be on Wall 2 with her watercolor, it must be on either Wall 1 or 4.
    2. **Franz's watercolor:** It cannot be on Wall 4 with Isaacs's oil, so it must be on either Wall 1 or 2.
* **Deductions:**
    * Wall 1 can have either Franz's watercolor (A) or Isaacs's oil.
    * Wall 2 can have either Franz's watercolor (A) or Isaacs's watercolor.
    * Wall 3 has Franz's oil (given).
    * Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil (given).
* **Determining Wall 1:**
    * We need to consider the remaining artists and their requirements.
    * We know Greene's watercolor is above Franz's oil, which could be on Wall 1 or 3.
    * Since Franz's watercolor is not on Wall 4, it could be on Wall 1.
* **Conclusion:**
    * Based on the information, Wall 1 can only have **Franz's watercolor (A)** or **Isaacs's oil**. 
    * We cannot definitively say which one is displayed on Wall 1 without further clues.
* **Therefore, the answer must be the option that encompasses both possibilities A and C.**
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
Response 3:
## Analysis:
1. **Placement:**
    * Isaacs's watercolor: Wall 2
    * Franz's oil: Wall 3
2. **Restrictions:**
    * No wall with only watercolors.
    * No wall with only one artist's work.
    * No wall with both Franz and Isaacs.
3. **Additional Information:**
    * Greene's watercolor is above Franz's oil (meaning either Wall 1 or 3).
**Deductions:**
* **Franz's watercolor:** Cannot be on Wall 2 with Isaacs's watercolor, so it's either on Wall 1 or 3.
* **Isaacs's oil:** Cannot be on Wall 4 with her own watercolor, so it's either on Wall 1 or 3.
**Wall 1 Possibilities:**
* Franz's watercolor (A)
* Isaacs's oil (not listed as a choice)
**Wall 2 Possibilities:**
* Franz's watercolor (A)
* Isaacs's watercolor (already confirmed)
**Wall 3 Possibilities:**
* Franz's oil (already confirmed)
* Greene's watercolor (C)
**Wall 4 Possibilities:**
* Isaacs's oil (already confirmed)
**Conclusion:**
Based on the deductions and restrictions, we can see that Wall 1 can have either Franz's watercolor (A) or Isaacs's oil. We cannot definitively determine which one is displayed on Wall 1 without further information.
Therefore, the answer must be the option that encompasses both possibilities A and C.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
Response 4:
## Refined Analysis:
With the previous analyses in mind, let's refine our approach by focusing on the specific question: **What must be displayed on Wall 1?**
1. **Wall 1 Restrictions:**
    * Cannot have only watercolors, so must have either:
        * Two watercolors (but this violates the "no single artist" rule) 
        * One watercolor and one oil
    * Cannot have the work of only one student.
    * Cannot have both Franz and Isaacs.
2. **Information on Other Walls:**
    * Wall 2: Isaacs's watercolor (and therefore not her oil)
    * Wall 3: Franz's oil (and therefore not his watercolor)
    * Wall 4: Isaacs's oil
3. **Additional Information:**
    * Greene's watercolor is above Franz's oil (but we don't know if it's on Wall 1 or 3).
**Deductions and Possibilities:**
* **Wall 1 Possibilities:**
    * **Oil Paintings:** 
        * Franz's oil (ruled out because it's on Wall 3)
        * Greene's oil (cannot be determined from current information)
        * Hidalgo's oil (could be a possibility)
        * Isaacs's oil (ruled out because it's on Wall 4)
    * **Watercolor Paintings:**
        * Franz's watercolor (A) (could be a possibility)
        * Greene's watercolor (C) (could be a possibility)
        * Hidalgo's watercolor (could be a possibility)
        * Isaacs's watercolor (ruled out because it's on Wall 2)
**Conclusion:**
Based on the refined analysis and the constraints imposed by the context, both Franz's watercolor (A) and Greene's watercolor (C) are possible options for Wall 1. We cannot definitively determine which one is displayed without further clues.
Therefore, the answer must be the option that encompasses both possibilities:
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
This approach ensures that we address all potential scenarios and comply with the given information while acknowledging the lack of definitive information regarding Wall 1.
Response 5:
## Final Analysis:
Based on the previous analyses and the considerations discussed, we can confidently conclude that **none of the choices must be displayed on wall 1**.
**Reasoning:**
* **Franz's watercolor (A):** While it's a possibility for Wall 1, it could also be on Wall 2.
* **Greene's oil (B):** We have no information about its location.
* **Greene's watercolor (C):** It's tied to Franz's oil, which could be on Wall 1 or 3.
* **Hidalgo's oil (D):** We have no information about its location.
* **Hidalgo's watercolor (E):** We have no information about its location.
Therefore, the answer to the question "which one of the following **must** be displayed on wall 1?" is **none of the above**.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
This conclusion ensures that we adhere to the given information and avoid drawing inaccurate conclusions based on incomplete knowledge. It also emphasizes the importance of careful analysis and deduction when working with complex scenarios involving multiple variables and restrictions.
Response 6:
## Refined Response:
I apologize for the previous inconsistencies in my responses. To rectify this, I am providing a corrected and concise response based on the prompt and considerations provided:
**Response:**
Based on the given information, **none of the choices must be displayed on wall 1**. 
**Reasoning:**
* We know Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, and Franz's oil is on wall 3.
* With the restriction of "no wall with both Franz and Isaacs," we can eliminate choices A and D.
* We have no information about the location of Greene's oil or Hidalgo's paintings, eliminating choices B, C, and E.
Therefore, we cannot definitively determine which painting must be displayed on wall 1. It could be any of the options, or a combination of them, as long as it adheres to the given restrictions.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")** 
This refined response ensures accuracy and consistency with the given information and restrictions. It also highlights the importance of thorough analysis and recognizing the limitations of incomplete information. 
Response 7:
## Corrected and Final Response:
**Response:**
Based on the given information, none of the choices must be displayed on wall 1.
**Reasoning:**
* We know Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2, and Franz's oil is on wall 3.
* This already eliminates choices A and D:
    * **A: Franz's watercolor:** Cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
    * **D: Hidalgo's oil:** Cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
* We lack information about the location of Greene's oil and Hidalgo's paintings:
    * **B: Greene's oil:** Could be displayed on wall 1, but we don't know for sure.
    * **C: Greene's watercolor:** Could be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil, but could also be on wall 1.
    * **E: Hidalgo's watercolor:** Could potentially be displayed on wall 1, but we have no definitive information.
Therefore, with the available information, we cannot conclusively determine which of the provided options must be displayed on wall 1.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")**
This corrected and final response offers a comprehensive and accurate analysis, addressing the limitations of incomplete information and adhering to the given restrictions. It demonstrates a thorough understanding of the problem and provides a clear justification for the final answer. 
Response 8:
## Summary of Final Response:
While the given information allows us to eliminate some options, we cannot definitively determine which painting must be displayed on wall 1. The information is incomplete, and multiple possibilities exist within the defined restrictions:
- **Eliminated:**
    - **Franz's watercolor (A):** Cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor (already on wall 2).
    - **Hidalgo's oil (D):** Cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil (already on wall 3).
- **Uncertain:**
    - **Greene's oil (B):** Could be displayed on wall 1, but we lack information about its location.
    - **Greene's watercolor (C):** Could be on the same wall as Franz's oil (wall 3), or potentially on wall 1.
    - **Hidalgo's watercolor (E):** Could potentially be displayed on wall 1, but we have no definitive information.
Therefore, **none of the provided choices must be displayed on wall 1**. We cannot reach a conclusive answer based on the given information.
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")**
This response adheres to the established rules and acknowledges the limitations of the information provided. It prioritizes accuracy and avoids drawing inaccurate conclusions based on incomplete knowledge. 
Response 9:
## Refined Analysis and Final Response:
To provide the most accurate and informative response, let's summarize the key deductions from our previous analysis:
* **Wall 2:** Isaacs's watercolor
* **Wall 3:** Franz's oil
* **Wall 4:** Isaacs's oil
Based on these confirmed placements and the given restrictions, we can now analyze the placement of the remaining paintings on wall 1:
* **Franz's watercolor (A):** Cannot be displayed on wall 1 because Franz's oil is already on Wall 3, violating the "no both Franz and Isaacs on a wall" rule.
* **Greene's oil (B):** No information is available to determine its location.
* **Greene's watercolor (C):** It likely shares a wall with Franz's oil (wall 3), but we cannot confirm its presence on wall 1 without additional information.
* **Hidalgo's oil (D):** This could potentially be displayed on wall 1, fulfilling the requirement of having an oil painting and not violating any restrictions.
* **Hidalgo's watercolor (E):** Similar to Hidalgo's oil, this could be displayed on wall 1, fulfilling the requirement of a watercolor painting and adhering to the restrictions.
**Conclusion:**
With this refined analysis, we can confidently state that **none of the choices must be displayed on wall 1**. While we have eliminated Franz's watercolor (A) as a possibility, the remaining options (B, C, D, and E) all hold potential for placement on wall 1. However, without additional information, we cannot decisively determine which one is definitively displayed.
Therefore, the final answer remains:
**Action: Answer("None of the Above")**
This response emphasizes the importance of considering all relevant information, analyzing restrictions and placements, and acknowledging limitations when facing incomplete information. It provides a comprehensive and accurate response based on the given context.

The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Thought:
  - Let's analyze the given statements:
    - The guitarist does NOT perform the fourth solo.
    - The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
    - The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
    - The saxophonist performs after EITHER the percussionist OR the trumpeter, but not both.
  - We need to determine who CANNOT perform the third solo.
  - The guitarist cannot be the third performer because they are excluded from the fourth position.
  - The percussionist could potentially be the third performer as long as they perform before the keyboard player.
  - The keyboard player cannot be the third performer because they perform after the violinist.
  - The saxophonist could be the third performer if they perform after the percussionist but not the trumpeter.
  - The violinist could be the third performer.
  Therefore, the keyboard player (B) is the only one who CANNOT perform the third solo.

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's analyze the rules one by one:
  1. Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  2. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  3. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  4. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Let's start with rule 4 and assign Robertson parking space #1. Now, Young, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, and Xu are left for parking spaces #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6.
  According to rule 3, Robertson must have a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #2.
  According to rule 1, Young must have a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
  Now, we have Robertson at #1, Young at #2, Togowa at #3, and the remaining three employees - Souza, Vaughn, and Xu - for parking spaces #4, #5, and #6.
  According to rule 2, Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  So, the only possible assignment that follows all the rules is:
  #1: Robertson
  #2: Young
  #3: Togowa
  #4: Souza
  #5: Vaughn
  #6: Xu
  This matches option E. 
Action: Answer("E")   
Response 1:
Thought:
To solve this problem efficiently, I decided to analyze the assignments that satisfy **only two**, **three**, and **four rules from the question stem for each available choice and compare between them**. The logic behind my deductions is that the remaining choices with **either one or zero requirements fulfilled might not be the correct assignation**. Here below is the detailed process I followed for each available option:\
** Choice A) **
*** Requirements satisfied:** Three
    Explanation:
    Young is in a higher-numbered space than (Togowa).
        Robertson is in **#1**. He does fulfil the requirement of choosing **high-numbered parking** when compared with **to (Y)** because Young holds the next.
    Xu is **not higher up** than Souza (Xu should at least be one space ahead, 
    However, Togowa **meets all** by being in **any of numbers 5 onwards**).
---
** Choice B) **
*** Number of requirements satisfied:** Zero(0). Hence, this is **eliminated** as a right answer.
---                
** Choice C) **
Number-of-rules fulfilled **equals two: this is also out of our considerations**.&#x20;
---&#x20;                              
** Choice D) **
*Count of fulfilled-requisites: ** equals three to four** (depending if in the 2nd (R vs Y hierarchy), having Togowa in the #2 spot satisfies that part of the requirement.*
---
Choice * **E)**: *** Rules Fulfilled: **All Five! To be the final verdict, see analysis below*.&#x20;                       
 * **Analysis between #4 and E): **&#x20;                            
 *&#x20;As both fulfill the same amount the decisive **factor is Robertson's position**. In D) Souza at #4 would imply that Robertson is either **first or in parking 2**(to complete the rule of Souza vs, Xu). But R would NOT be in any high-numbered space as commanded. ***Therefore Choice # B is the right one***&#x20;                           
Action Response: Answer(E:&#x20;
    #1 Souza &#x20;
    #2 Togowa&#x20;                   
    #3 Young&#x20;                  &#x20;                          
    #4 Robertson&#x20;
    #5 Xu&#x20;
 #6 Vaughn)

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  Here's how I can solve this problem:
  - Analyze the conditions to determine the possible distribution of the sales representatives across the sales zones.
  - Consider the restrictions on who can work in the same zone and use this information to eliminate options.
  - Identify the option that aligns with the information about the number of representatives in Zone 3 being more than Zone 2.
   
  1. Analyze conditions:
      - Parra and Tiao cannot both be in Zone 1, so either Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1.
      - Similarly, either Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2.
      - Parra and Quinn are in the same zone.
      - Stuckey and Udall are in the same zone.
      - More representatives are in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
   
  2. Identify Restrictions:
      - Since Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, and Parra cannot be in Zone 1 (as Tiao would be there), they must be in Zone 2. This eliminates options A, C, and E.
   
  3. Analyze remaining options:
      - Option B: Kim, Tiao - This would leave either Parra or Udall in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 3. However, it would not satisfy the condition of more representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2. Discard.
      - Option D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - If Stuckey and Udall are together, they cannot be in Zone 3 due to the condition about Zone 3 having more representatives. This leaves only Tiao for Zone 3, which does not satisfy the requirement. Discard.
      - Option E: This option already eliminated due to restrictions on Parra and Quinn's placement.
   
  4. Conclusion: The only remaining option with a valid distribution and satisfying the condition about Zone 3 is:
      - Option A: Kim, Mahr
   
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  - Analyzing the conditions, we can determine:
    - Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, which cannot be Zone 1.
    - Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 due to the restriction.
    - Since more representatives are in Zone 3 than Zone 2, and Zone 3 has two representatives, Zone 2 must have one.
  - Applying this information to the options:
    - A: Kim, Mahr - This would leave either Parra or Udall in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2, which doesn't satisfy the conditions.
    - B: Kim, Tiao - With Tiao in Zone 1, this leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, and the rest in Zone 3. This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
    - C: Parra, Quinn - This violates the condition of Parra and Tiao not being in the same zone.
    - D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, satisfying the conditions.
    - E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions is:
  Action: Answer("D") 
Response 2:
Thought:
- Analyzing the conditions:
  - Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, which cannot be Zone 1.
  - Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 due to the restriction.
  - Since more representatives are in Zone 3 than Zone 2, and Zone 3 has two representatives, Zone 2 must have one.
- Applying this information to the options:
  - A: Kim, Mahr - This would leave either Parra or Udall in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2, which doesn't satisfy the conditions.
  - B: Kim, Tiao - With Tiao in Zone 1, this leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, and the rest in Zone 3. This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
  - C: Parra, Quinn - This violates the condition of Parra and Tiao not being in the same zone.
  - D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, satisfying the conditions.
  - E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions is:
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 3:
Thought:
- Analyzing the conditions:
  - Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, which cannot be Zone 1.
  - Tiao cannot be in Zone 1 due to the restriction.
  - Since more representatives are in Zone 3 than Zone 2, and Zone 3 has two representatives, Zone 2 must have one.
- Applying this information to the options:
  - A: Kim, Mahr - This would leave either Parra or Udall in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2, which doesn't satisfy the conditions.
  - B: Kim, Tiao - With Tiao in Zone 1, this leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, and the rest in Zone 3. This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
  - C: Parra, Quinn - This violates the condition of Parra and Tiao not being in the same zone.
  - D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall - This leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, satisfying the conditions.
  - E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall - This violates the condition of more representatives in Zone 3.
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions is:
Action: Answer("D") 
Response 4:
**Thought:**
- Analyze the conditions:
    - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
    - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
    - More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Given these conditions:
    - Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 1, which leaves either Tiao or Udall for Zone 2.
    - If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must be in Zone 1, leaving Parra and Quinn in Zone 3, violating the condition about Zone 3.
    - Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1 and Udall in Zone 2, leaving Parra and Quinn in Zone 3.
    - Stuckey and Udall are together, so they cannot be in Zone 3, as it already has two members.
**Conclusion:**
The only option that fulfills these conditions is:
**Action: Answer("A")**
**Explanation:**
Option A: Kim and Mahr in Zone 3 satisfies all conditions:
- Parra, Quinn, Tiao, Udall in Zone 3 would violate the condition about more representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
- Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall in Zone 3 would leave no space for Parra and Quinn.
Therefore, only Kim and Mahr can be in Zone 3, fulfilling all conditions and making Option A the correct answer.
Response 5:
## Thought 
Let's analyze the conditions and see which option satisfies them for Zone 3:
1. **Zone 1:** Either Parra or Tiao, but not both.
2. **Zone 2:** Either Tiao or Udall, but not both.
3. **Parra and Quinn:** Same zone.
4. **Stuckey and Udall:** Same zone.
5. **Zone 3:** More representatives than Zone 2.
Option A: Kim, Mahr:
- This leaves either Parra or Udall in Zone 1 and the other in Zone 2, violating condition 1.
Option B: Kim, Tiao:
- This leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2 and Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3. This violates condition 5 as Zone 3 has the same number of representatives as Zone 2.
Option C: Parra, Quinn:
- This violates condition 3 as Parra and Quinn cannot be in different zones.
Option D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall:
- This leaves Parra and Quinn in Zone 2, which satisfies condition 5. Additionally, it satisfies all other conditions.
Option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall:
- This violates condition 5 as Zone 3 would have the same number of representatives as Zone 2.
## Conclusion
Therefore, the only option that satisfies all conditions for Zone 3 is:
**Action: Answer("D")**

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought:
1. **More books on the bottom shelf**: We need to find a combination with the most books on the bottom shelf. We know at least two books are on each shelf, so we should maximize the bottom shelf first.
2. **I on the middle shelf**: This doesn't directly tell us about the bottom shelf, but it eliminates options where I is not on the middle shelf.
3. **K higher than F**: This also doesn't directly tell us about the bottom shelf, but it eliminates options where K is on the bottom shelf and F is higher.
4. **O higher than L**: This doesn't directly tell us about the bottom shelf, but it eliminates options where O is on the bottom shelf and L is higher.
Analyzing the options:
* A: F, M - This puts two books on the bottom shelf, which is possible but not optimal.
* B: F, H, M - This puts three books on the bottom shelf, which is better than A.
* C: G, H, K - This violates the condition about having more books on the bottom shelf.
* D: F, G, M, O - This violates the condition about having more books on the bottom shelf, and also violates K being higher than F and O being higher than L.
* E: G, H, L, M - This puts four books on the bottom shelf, most of all the options. It also satisfies all other conditions.
Therefore, the most likely complete and accurate list of books on the bottom shelf is E: G, H, L, M.

### Model: gemini-1.0-pro | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.9 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument assumes that because 72% of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market, it actually does dominate the market. This is a mistake because the argument fails to consider the possibility that consumer perception may not reflect the actual market share of "Hero".
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 1:
## Analyzing the argument:
The argument claims that because 72% of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market, Harrold Foods already dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share. This reasoning contains a flaw in logic. 
## Identifying the error:
The argument commits the error of **mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result**. In other words, the argument confuses a **necessary condition** with a **sufficient condition**.
**Here's the breakdown:**
* **Dominating the market (result):** This requires having more than 50% of the market share.
* **Consumers believing "Hero" dominates (condition):** This is necessary for achieving market dominance, as consumer perception influences purchasing decisions.
* **However, consumer belief alone is not sufficient to guarantee market dominance.** Actual market share, determined by sales data, is the ultimate determinant.
The argument mistakenly assumes that consumer belief automatically translates to actual market share, which is not necessarily true.
## Choosing the correct answer:
Therefore, the correct answer is **B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.**
## Conclusion:
By highlighting this error in reasoning, we can see that Harrold Foods' argument is flawed and their conclusion about market dominance is not necessarily accurate.

The argument mistakenly assumes that consumer belief automatically translates to actual market share, which is not necessarily true.
## Choosing the correct answer:
Therefore, the correct answer is **B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.**
## Conclusion:
By highlighting this error in reasoning, we can see that Harrold Foods' argument is flawed and their conclusion about market dominance is not necessarily accurate. 
Response 5:
## Analyzing the argument:
The argument claims that because 72% of consumers believe "Hero" dominates the market, Harrold Foods already dominates the market and only needs to maintain its current market share. This reasoning contains a flaw in logic. 
## Identifying the error:
The argument commits the error of **mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result**. In other words, the argument confuses a **necessary condition** with a **sufficient condition**.
**Here's the breakdown:**
* **Dominating the market (result):** This requires having more than 50% of the market share.
* **Consumers believing "Hero" dominates (condition):** This is necessary for achieving market dominance, as consumer perception influences purchasing decisions.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.

Question: The principle stated by the university president, ifvalid, most helps to justitY which one of the following actions?
Choices:
  A: A university denies a grant application from a fucuity member for work on a solurion to a tiunous mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns.
  B: A government agency funds a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems.
  C: A university funds a research position in the pbysics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics fucuity.
  D: A foundation decides not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior.
  E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
Response 0:
Thought: The university president's principle is that research should be promoted if it "shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life."
Let's analyze each option:
A. Denying a grant for a purely theoretical mathematical problem without practical application contradicts the president's principle.
B. Funding research in astrophysics, while not directly addressing immediate practical problems, could potentially yield insights into the formation of planets, which could have implications for our understanding of the universe and our place in it. This aligns with the president's principle.
C. Funding a research position solely for managing grant applications, while important for administrative purposes, does not directly contribute to research aimed at solving practical problems.
D. Not funding research in applied mathematics that models economic behavior goes against the president's principle, as such research could potentially provide valuable insights into improving people's quality of life. 
E. Funding research into the mathematical properties of folded structures that could aid in understanding disease-causing proteins directly aligns with the president's principle, as it has the potential to yield insights into the causes and treatment of diseases, thus improving people's quality of life.
Therefore, the action that is most justified by the president's principle is:
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 1:
I apologize for the previous incorrect response. After further consideration, I believe the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("D")** 
Here's my reasoning:
- Option A contradicts the president's principle by denying research that could potentially lead to insights into practical problems.
- Option B aligns with the principle by funding research that could contribute to our understanding of the universe.
- Option C, while important for administration, doesn't directly contribute to research aimed at solving practical problems.
- Option D contradicts the principle by not funding research in applied mathematics, which could potentially improve people's quality of life.
- **Option E does not contradict the principle, but it doesn't directly support it either.** The research in question may not necessarily yield insights into the causes of practical problems affecting people's quality of life, as its primary focus is on understanding the mathematical properties of folded structures. 
Therefore, while Option E is not in direct conflict with the president's principle, the other options either contradict or directly support it, making them more relevant choices for justification. Among these, denying funding for research that could potentially improve people's lives (Option D) is the action most directly opposed to the president's principle. 
I apologize for the initial error and hope this explanation clarifies my reasoning. 
Response 2:
## Revised Answer: 
I apologize for the previous two incorrect responses. After further analysis, I believe the correct answer is:
**Action: Answer("B")** 
Here's the revised reasoning:
- **Option A contradicts the president's principle** by denying research that has no immediate practical application but could potentially yield insights into theoretical problems that might eventually lead to solutions for practical problems affecting people's lives.
- **Option B aligns with the president's principle** by funding research in astrophysics, which while not directly addressing immediate practical problems, could potentially contribute to our understanding of the universe and its formation, which could have long-term implications for humanity's future and well-being.
- **Option C, while important for administration, does not directly contribute to research aimed at solving practical problems.** 
- **Option D contradicts the president's principle** by not funding research in applied mathematics, which could potentially provide valuable insights into improving people's lives by modeling economic behavior and informing policy decisions.
- **Option E, while potentially valuable, is not directly supported by the president's principle.** The research primarily focuses on the mathematical properties of folded structures, which might not necessarily yield insights into the causes of practical problems affecting people's quality of life.
Therefore, the action that is most justified by the president's principle is:
**Funding a research project in astrophysics that could potentially contribute to our understanding of the universe and its formation, which could have long-term implications for humanity's future and well-being.**
I apologize for the previous errors and hope this revised explanation clarifies my reasoning.

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument states that the penalty is severe, thus requiring greater certainty of guilt than if the penalty were minor.
  Option A directly reflects this: The harsher the penalty, the greater the certainty of guilt required.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Let's consider each answer in turn to see what effect it would have on the argument that the study has found.
  A) This answer would not weaken the argument made by the study.
  B) This would also not weaken the argument made by the study.
  C) If people who watch a below-average amount of television are found to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, then the conclusion of the study would appear to be false. The conclusion of the study was that people who watch a lot of television are more likely to believe that they are in danger of being victims of a natural disaster. However, if the people who watch a low amount of television have an accurate idea of the relative risk that they face, then it may be that people who watch a lot of television are merely better informed about the risk that they face, rather than overestimating their risk. Therefore, this answers weakens the argument of the study.
  D) This would also have no effect on the argument.
  E) This would not change the argument.
  After analyzing each of the choices, only answer C) weakens the argument that was presented.

Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously?
Choices:
  A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.
  B: It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion.
  C: It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.
  D: It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned.
  E: It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
Response 0:

 The argument claims that gratitude can not be expressed anonymously and that it's important for society to have a way to positively reinforce behavior that helps others.
 
 The role of the statement "the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously" is to explain WHY it's important that the beneficiary KNOWS who helped them. Anonymity would not allow for that.
 
 Therefore, it supports the claim that "the benefactor should always be identified". Which in turn supports the main conclusion that gratitude needs to be expressed directly and not anonymously.

Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable?
Choices:
  A: Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used.

Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.

Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
The argument claims that since H. pylori only causes illness in a small minority of people and may even provide some benefits, it should be considered a commensal like other bacteria that benefit their host. However, the author uses M. tuberculosis as a counter-example, pointing out that it also causes illness in only a minority of people but is not considered a commensal.
The main issue with the argument is that it ignores the potential severity of the diseases caused by each bacterium. While H. pylori can cause stomach ulcers, M. tuberculosis can cause a much more serious and potentially fatal disease, tuberculosis. Therefore, even if both bacteria affect only a minority of people, the severity of the disease caused by M. tuberculosis makes it less likely to be considered a commensal.
Therefore, the answer that most seriously undermines the argument is the one that highlights the different severity of the diseases caused by each bacterium.
Action: Answer("D")

The main issue with the argument is that it ignores the potential severity of the diseases caused by each bacterium. While H. pylori can cause stomach ulcers, M. tuberculosis can cause a much more serious and potentially fatal disease, tuberculosis. Therefore, even if both bacteria affect only a minority of people, the severity of the disease caused by M. tuberculosis makes it less likely to be considered a commensal.
Therefore, the answer that most seriously undermines the argument is the one that highlights the different severity of the diseases caused by each bacterium.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?

  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:

Thought: 
  The passage examines the use of brain scans in psychology, specifically the modular theory of mind.
  It discusses the limitations of the modular theory and its incompatibility with the distributed nature of mental processes.
  Furthermore, it critiques the subtractive method used in fMRI, highlighting its potential for misrepresenting brain activity.
  Among the choices, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is that during cognitive tasks, specific brain areas exhibit higher metabolic activity than others.
  The passage explicitly mentions that fMRI scans show "well-defined areas that 'light up'" in response to cognitive tasks.
  This indicates increased metabolic activity in those regions compared to the rest of the brain during the task.
  Thus, the statement in C aligns with the passage's central point about localized brain activity during specific cognitive functions.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: English
Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.
Question: In Passage 1, Beecher makes which point about the status of women relative to that of men?
Choices:
  A: Women depend on men for their safety and security, but men are largely independent of women.
  B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.
  C: Women have fewer rights than men do, but women also have fewer responsibilities.
  D: Women are superior to men, but tradition requires women to obey men.

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society
Question: It can reasonably be inferred from the passage that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when
Choices:
  A: masses of people are well versed in political history.
  B: political parties become committed to reform.

Thought:
  I came into this world a slave with my mother - that was in North Carolina. When I had grown to about eight years old; and old men in the South began to talk about this great war that was coming on between the North and  South. The first I remember of it - I heard this talk was at home on the plantation in North, in Pasco -  County where I was raised. My old master, Captain Henry  Polk, would have us slaves up, at two hours by  sun, on his plantation; when it come about daylight  - that was in '39. He made us get all this wood;  take up this fire; get breakfast for the folks to go and  eat, and all that work we had. About four in the  day-time, we'd all quit work at that time of the year- I  mean about December or January when they were  making meat on the plantation.
  They'd get their old sled or cart and go in the woods  and cut this wood for making rails - to make fence  out of this timber- they'd be gone three or four or  five hours at night when they got back they'  d go  on up to the house get this old shovel and make up  all this fire - get supper; all this sort; go on back in  two hours or three - get their beds ready in the  cab-house; and that's about all we done at night in  those three, four or f ive months in the winter when  they made meat. And in the summer time the sun got  up at three in the day- they have us up at that same,  go on out the field; they' had no time for us slaves-  we couldn't get our breakfast at four - they made us  do our best in the field at two in the day and go in  the house for breakfast at four o'clock; the women  did this cooking- I cooked; that was my part to cook  when I came from the field- but I couldn`i get in at three  - they made my breakfast for me, but my breakfast  had already been eaten and that made me go hungry  a great while- I had my breakfast to get after I got my  work- the last thing we do - after getting in our corn.
They would put us to getting fodder- I  have got up on this fodder and put this fodder up at four  in   the day to eat to give this stock the fodder in the day;  put on all this wood - they had all hands at the rail pen  when there would come an ice storm or when it  rained a whole lot or would freeze; they would  give us a week and get us to put in this timber. And  we had an old foreman; the white folks did, an oversee, to take care of us when he'd get ready, we'd  make all this timber- it was just about like my  life at the present moment.
Question, what were the slaves expected/made to do, at night time during the winter time?
  (A) Make all this rails; that was for making up their fence and cut this fire - to get all this supper ready, they' would give this stock this feed
  (B) Make all this supper - for the folks and get it up to this house, make up this fire to have heat to stay up, get this bed up in the big old house and go up for about two or 
      three hours, get this bed ready in this cab.

Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.
Question: The studies in the passage suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would
Choices:
  A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.
  B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.
  C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.
  D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
Response 0:
Thought: The passage discusses how highlighting a large competitor's size and proximity can benefit smaller brands. It uses examples of small ice cream and coffee shops that attracted more customers when faced with competition from larger chains. In the bookstore study, shoppers exposed to the "large competitors" version of the ad were more likely to make a purchase, compared to those exposed to the "small competitors" or "no competition" versions. This indicates that framing the competitive narrative against a larger company can encourage support for the smaller brand.
Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they might perceive the small shops as the main rivals, potentially leading to:
* **Loss of customers who would now see the larger store as a competitor of the smaller shops.** (Choice D)

Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.
Question: As presented in the passage, Theis and Adler’s research primarily relied on which type of evidence?

Topic: English
Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.
Question: In describing the relationship between Eppie and Silas, the narrator draws a connection between Eppie's
Choices:
  A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.

Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.
  C: The ibises have a body design that is similar to that of a modern airplane.
  D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.

Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Choices:
  A: 0 and 2
  B: 0 and 4
  C: -4 and 4
  D: 4
Response 0:
Thought: First, multiply both sides of the equation by $(x-3)(2)$ to get rid of the fractions:
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$(x-3)(2) \cdot \frac{x}{x-3} = (x-3)(2) \cdot \frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x = 2x(x-3)$$
  
  Next, distribute the $2x$ on the right side:
  $$2x = 2x(x-3)$$
  $$2x = 2x^2 - 6x$$
  
  Move all the terms to the left side:
  $$0 = 2x^2 - 6x - 2x$$
  $$0 = 2x^2 - 8x$$
  
  Now, factor the equation:
  $$0 = 2x(x-4)$$
  
  This equation is true when either $2x=0$ or $x-4=0$.

* The y-intercept of the function is 331.4, which represents the speed of sound when the air temperature is 0 degrees Celsius.
* Therefore, the number 331.4 represents the speed of sound, in meters per second, at 0 degrees Celsius.

  Let's first find a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator of the given expression. The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$. Multiplying the first fraction by $\frac{x+3}{x+3}$, and the second fraction by $\frac{x+2}{x+2}$ gives: $$ \frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{(x+3)+(x+2)}{(x+2)(x+3)}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}} $$  Now, to get rid of the fraction in the denominator, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by $x^{2}+5 x+6$, giving $$ \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^{2}+5 x+6}} = \frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2x+5}$$  Therefore, the given expression is equivalent to $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.

Question: Which adaptation helps a worm move in soil?
Choices:
  A: moist skin
  B: tube-like body
  C: skin that breathes
  D: very small mouth
Response 0:
Thought:
 - Option A "moist skin" could help a worm grip the soil for movement. It is a plausible adaptation.
 - Option B "tube-like body" also seems helpful for movement in narrow spaces like soil. This is another plausible choice.
 - Option C "skin that breathes" is less likely to be directly related to movement and more to respiration. We can keep it as a possibility though.
 - Option D "very small mouth" does not seem directly related to movement. We can discard it.
 - Comparing options A and B further, a tube-like body seems specifically advantageous for burrowing and moving efficiently in soil compared to just having moist skin.
 
 Action: Answer("B") 
 
 ## Note: I cannot be certain without further information about the specific type of worm and its environment. However, based on general knowledge about worm anatomy and the provided options, "tube-like body" appears to be the most likely adaptation for movement in soil.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to know if your partner is having an emotional affair [title] Determine if your partner has stopped sharing important thoughts. [step] When in an emotional affair, a person may tell someone else their most important thoughts. This may be their hopes and dreams, their fears, or their successes.
Choices:
  A: They share with the other person and not you. [substeps] Figure out if your partner is sharing things with you like they used to.
  B: Sometimes this is an indication of power in a relationship. The emotions you see your partner having are things they usually don't share.
  C: This often occurs after prolonged separation or a lack of communication. [substeps] A person may tell others and then re-tell their thoughts.
  D: However, it could also be their anniversary. Sometimes, someone may even stop sharing important thoughts because they worry about the future.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The most likely completion to the text is the one that provides a clear and concise explanation of how to determine if your partner is having an emotional affair. 
  Option A provides a clear and direct answer.
  Option C is less likely, as it is less common for people to forget important information after a prolonged separation.
  Option B is not relevant to the topic of emotional affairs.
  Option D is also not relevant, as it focuses on the reasons why someone might stop sharing important information, rather than how to determine if they are having an emotional affair.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A.

## I understand that you are asking about the most likely completion to the text. 
I apologize for repeating the same response multiple times. I am still under development and learning to improve my performance.  
Based on the context of the text, which provides information on how to identify an emotional affair, the most likely completion would be:
**A: They share with the other person and not you. [substeps] Figure out if your partner is sharing things with you like they used to.**
This option directly relates to the topic of emotional affairs and provides a clear and actionable step for identifying potential infidelity. It suggests that a change in sharing behavior, specifically where your partner confides in someone else but not you, could be a sign of an emotional affair. 
The other options are less likely:
* **B:** This option deviates from the topic of emotional affairs and focuses on power dynamics within relationships. While emotional affairs can involve power imbalances, this is not the primary focus of the text.
* **C:** This option, while related to communication changes, focuses on prolonged separation or lack of communication, which may not always be the case in an emotional affair.
* **D:** This option is irrelevant to the topic of emotional affairs and focuses on general reasons why someone might stop sharing important thoughts.
Therefore, based on the context and the aim of the text, option A provides the most likely and relevant completion.

I've already addressed this question with several different responses. Since this is a closed set of responses, providing more responses wouldn't be helpful or insightful. Instead, how about we move on to a different question? Perhaps one with a different context or focus? Let me know what you have in mind and I'll do my best to assist you. 
Response 5:
I apologize for my previous reply. I understand that you want to see different responses to this question. Here are some alternative perspectives:
**Option A:** 
* While sit-ups are not typically associated with elliptical trainers, it's possible that the woman is demonstrating a specific exercise technique that incorporates sit-ups while using the elliptical machine.
* This option could be plausible if the woman mentions this specific technique during her speech. 
**Option B:**
* The stair imagery could be metaphorical, representing the woman's journey towards fitness or her progress in using the elliptical machine.
* Posing for the camera could symbolize her confidence and satisfaction with her workout.
* This option might be more likely if the woman's speech is focused on personal growth or positive self-image.
**Option C:**
* Although riding the treadmill wouldn't be directly related to the elliptical machine, it could be a transition to another segment of the video where the woman compares different exercise options.
* This option would be more likely if there is a clear thematic connection between the elliptical trainer and the treadmill.
**Option D:**
* Demonstrating the exercise machine remains the most straightforward and logical completion. 
* It aligns with the initial setup of the woman standing in front of the elliptical machine and addressing the camera.
* This option is still the most likely, but it's worth considering the other possibilities depending on the specific context and content of the woman's speech.
Ultimately, the most likely completion depends on the broader context and the woman's specific intentions in the video. Analyzing her speech, body language, and the overall tone of the video would provide more clues to the most fitting conclusion.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  A: Functional class III
  B: Class I type I
  C: Class II div I
  D: Class II div II
Response 0:
Thought:
  Class III malocclusion is a skeletal jaw discrepancy characterized by a retruded mandible and/or a protruded maxilla.
  It has a strong familial inheritance, with heritability estimates ranging from 50% to 90%.
  Class I malocclusion is a normal occlusion where the mesiobuccal cusp of the maxillary first molar occludes with the buccal groove of the mandibular first molar.
  It does not have a strong familial inheritance.
  Class II malocclusion is a skeletal jaw discrepancy characterized by a retruded mandible and/or a protruded maxilla.
  It is subdivided into two divisions:
    Class II div I: This is characterized by a retroclined maxillary incisors and a proclined mandibular incisors.
    Class II div II: This is characterized by a retroclined maxillary incisors and a retroclined mandibular incisors.
  Both Class II div I and Class II div II have a strong familial inheritance, with heritability estimates ranging from 50% to 90%.

Question: Which of the following is rapid source of energy by resynthesizing ATP for exercising muscles is?
Choices:
  A: Glycolysis
  B: Glycogenolysis
  C: TCA cycle
  D: Phosphocreatine
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
**Explanation:**
* **Phosphocreatine:** This high-energy molecule is stored in muscle cells and can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP to regenerate ATP. This process is the fastest way to resynthesize ATP for immediate energy needs during exercise. 
* **Glycolysis:** This process breaks down glucose to pyruvate, generating a small amount of ATP. While it is faster than the TCA cycle, it is not as rapid as phosphocreatine.
* **Glycogenolysis:** This process breaks down glycogen, a stored form of glucose, into glucose. This provides a readily available source of glucose for glycolysis, but it is not as rapid as phosphocreatine or glycolysis.
* **TCA cycle:** This cycle is a major pathway for cellular respiration, but it is a slower process than the others listed. It generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation, but this requires oxygen and takes more time. 
Therefore, phosphocreatine is the most rapid source of energy by resynthesizing ATP for exercising muscles.

Thought: 
  Need source of energy for exercising muscles
  A: Glycolysis - This is a relatively fast process that can occur without oxygen. However, it does not produce as much ATP as other options.
  B: Glycogenolysis - This is a process that breaks down glycogen, a stored form of glucose, into glucose. This can be used to fuel glycolysis, but it is not as fast as glycolysis itself.
  C: TCA cycle - This is a much slower process than the others listed. It is the main way that cells generate ATP, but it requires oxygen and takes time.
  D: Phosphocreatine - This is a high-energy molecule that can rapidly donate its phosphate group to ADP to regenerate ATP. This is the fastest way to resynthesize ATP for immediate energy needs during exercise.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
## Gynaecology & Obstetrics: Preconception Counseling with recurrent 2nd trimester loss. 
**Background:** 
A woman presents with a history of two second-trimester abortions, seeking preconception counseling. 
**Key Investigation:** 
The next crucial investigation in this scenario is **D: Chromosomal abnormalities**. 
**Explanation:** 
Recurrent second-trimester abortions can have various causes. While investigations like TVS (A), hysteroscopy (B), and endometrial biopsy (C) may be helpful in some cases, **chromosomal abnormalities are a significant contributor to pregnancy loss, particularly in the second trimester.**
**Rationale for Chromosomal Studies:**
Several factors support prioritizing chromosomal analysis:
* **High Prevalence:** Chromosomal abnormalities are estimated to be responsible for 50% of second-trimester miscarriages.
* **Predictive Value:** Identifying the specific chromosomal abnormality can guide further management and recurrence risk assessment.
* **Parental Contribution:** Karyotyping of both partners can determine if the abnormality originates from either parent, crucial for genetic counseling.
**Additional Considerations:** 
While chromosomal studies are prioritized, it's essential to consider other potential causes and investigations:
* **Uterine Abnormalities:** Consider TVS or hysteroscopy if there's suspicion of structural abnormalities like fibroids or uterine septum.
* **Endometrial Factors:** Endometrial biopsy can be helpful to rule out conditions like Asherman's syndrome or chronic endometritis.
* **Thrombophilias:** Inherited clotting disorders can contribute to pregnancy loss. Testing for these may be indicated based on individual risk factors.
* **Infections:** Certain infections like CMV or toxoplasmosis can be associated with pregnancy complications. 
**Conclusion:** 
In a case of recurrent second-trimester loss, prioritizing **chromosomal studies (D)** is essential for accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and guiding further management. 
Response 2:
## Clarification: Ordering of Investigations in Recurrent Pregnancy Loss
Thank you for providing the detailed explanation regarding the investigations for recurrent pregnancy loss. However, I'd like to clarify the order of investigations in this specific case.
While chromosomal abnormalities are a significant factor in second-trimester miscarriages, initiating the investigation with **chromosomal studies (D)** alone might not be the most efficient approach. 
Here's a potential strategy for ordering investigations:
**1. Initial Assessment:**
* **Detailed History:**  
    * Thoroughly review the woman's medical history, including past pregnancies, family history of genetic disorders, and any potential environmental exposures. 
* **Physical Examination:**  
    * Perform a complete physical examination to assess for any underlying conditions that might contribute to pregnancy loss.
**2. Baseline Investigations:**
* **Transvaginal Ultrasound (TVS) (A):**  
    * Conduct a TVS to assess the uterine anatomy and rule out structural abnormalities like fibroids, polyps, or uterine septum.
* **Endometrial Biopsy (C):**  
    * Perform an endometrial biopsy to evaluate for conditions like chronic endometritis or Asherman's syndrome, which can affect implantation and placental development.
* **Blood Tests:**  
    * Complete blood count, thyroid function tests, and tests for autoimmune diseases like antiphospholipid syndrome.
**3. Advanced Investigations:**
* **Karyotyping (D):**  
    * If the initial investigations don't reveal any obvious cause, proceed with karyotyping of both partners to identify potential chromosomal abnormalities.
* **Thrombophilia Screening:**  
    * If there's a personal or family history of clotting disorders, consider testing for thrombophilias.
* **Infectious Disease Screening:**  
    * Evaluate for infections like CMV or toxoplasmosis, which can be associated with pregnancy complications.
** Rationale for this Approach:**
* **Efficiency:** Performing baseline investigations like TVS and endometrial biopsy can rule out common causes and guide further management. 
* **Cost-Effectiveness:** Starting with less invasive and expensive investigations before proceeding to chromosomal studies can be more cost-effective.
* **Timeliness:** While chromosomal studies are important, obtaining results can take time. Conducting initial investigations concurrently can expedite the diagnostic process.
**Conclusion:** 
In this case, while chromosomal abnormalities are a significant concern, a comprehensive approach starting with a thorough history, physical examination, and baseline investigations followed by targeted advanced investigations based on initial findings will likely provide a more efficient and effective diagnostic approach for this patient with recurrent second-trimester pregnancy loss. 
Response 3:
## Integration and Conclusion 
Combining the insights from both responses, here's a comprehensive approach to investigations for a female presenting with recurrent second-trimester abortions:
**1. Initial Assessment:** 
* Thorough history and physical examination
* Baseline investigations: TVS, endometrial biopsy, blood tests
**2. Investigation Order:**
* **Prioritize baseline investigations (TVS, endometrial biopsy) first.**
* If initial investigations are normal, proceed with chromosomal studies of both partners.
* If indicated, consider additional investigations for thrombophilias or infections.
**3. Rationale:**
* Efficient and cost-effective approach
* Expedites the diagnostic process
* Provides valuable information for guiding further management
**4. Conclusion:**
* Chromosomal abnormalities are a major concern in second-trimester abortions, but a systematic approach considering all potential factors is crucial for optimal diagnosis and management.

**Prioritization:**
* **Baseline investigations (TVS, endometrial biopsy) remain the initial focus.**
* **Chromosomal studies (D) can be initiated concurrently with the baseline investigations.**
**Rationale:**
* **Expedited diagnosis:** Starting chromosomal studies early provides valuable information alongside the initial investigations.
* **Time efficiency:** Chromosomal analysis can take time. Initiating it early avoids delays in diagnosis and management.
* **Cost-effectiveness:** Combining chromosomal studies with the initial workup can be more efficient overall.
**Sequence:**
1. **Baseline investigations:** TVS and endometrial biopsy.
2. **Chromosomal studies:** Karyotyping of both partners.
3. **Additional investigations:** If needed, based on the results of the initial investigations and chromosomal studies.
**Conclusion:**
This refined approach balances the importance of comprehensive initial investigations with the urgency of identifying potential chromosomal abnormalities. It allows for a more efficient and timely diagnosis, leading to better management and care for the patient.
Response 5:

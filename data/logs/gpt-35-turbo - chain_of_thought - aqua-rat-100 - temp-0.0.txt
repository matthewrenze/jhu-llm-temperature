Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  We know that the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  We also know that 40 employees take both vacations, so we need to subtract them from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation to get the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  Therefore, Q = 80 - 40 = 40.
  So, 40% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  The answer is B: 15%.

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
Response 0:
Thought:
  The rectangular solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15.
  The sphere circumscribes the rectangular solid, so the diameter of the sphere is equal to the space diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The space diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The space diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250).
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is sqrt(250).
  Approximating sqrt(250) to two decimal places gives 15.81.

Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Thought:
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
- Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total number of hours available is 3x.
- The number of large cakes required is 20, and the number of small cakes required is 700.
- The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 2x * 3x = 6x^2.
- The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 35x * 3x = 105x^2.
- We need to solve for x in the following equation: 6x^2 >= 20 and 105x^2 >= 700.
- The first inequality gives us x >= sqrt(20/6) = 1.825.
- The second inequality gives us x >= sqrt(700/105) = 2.645.
- The smallest integer greater than or equal to both 1.825 and 2.645 is 3.

Question: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
Choices:
  A: 43 seconds
  B: 39 seconds
  C: 20 seconds
  D: 33 seconds
  E: 55 seconds
Response 0:
Thought:
  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.
  The tunnel is 1 mile long.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  The distance is the length of the tunnel, which is 1 mile.
  We need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  Then we can plug in the values and solve for time.
  time = 1 / (120/3600) = 0.025 hours = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds.
  However, we need to add the 3 seconds it takes for the train to enter the tunnel.
  Therefore, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 90 + 3 = 93 seconds.
  The answer is not one of the choices.

  We need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  Then we can plug in the values and solve for time.
  time = 1 / (120/3600) = 0.025 hours = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds.
  However, we need to add the 3 seconds it takes for the train to enter the tunnel.
  Therefore, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 90 + 3 = 93 seconds.
  The answer is not one of the choices.

Thought:
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.
  Let's assume the marked price is M.
  The selling price after a 20% discount would be 0.8M.
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit, so the cost price for him would be 1200*1.2 = 1440.
  The selling price should be greater than or equal to the cost price plus the profit, which is 1440*1.2 = 1728.
  0.8M >= 1728

  There are 5 vowels and 20 consonants.
  The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.
  The first and third letters must be different from each other and are both consonant, so there are 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter.
  The order of the letters matters, so we need to use the permutation formula.

Let's assume that the factory produced x staplers on Monday.
10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective, so the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x.
The number of non-defective staplers produced is 0.9x.
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.

Response 0:
Thought:
  To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color, we need to take out ties of different colors until we have two of the same color.
  The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color before we get two of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out 5 different ties before we can be sure that we have at least two of the same color.
  We can check that this is true by considering the case where we take out 4 ties: we could take out one of each color, leaving us with only one tie of each color.

Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Thought:
  If A and B are independent events, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs.
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)
  We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
  We can use these values to find P(neither A nor B) and then use that to find P(B).
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
  0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
  0.96 - 0.6 = -0.2P(B)
  0.36 = -0.2P(B)
  P(B) = -0.36 / -0.2 = 1.8
  This is not a valid probability, so we made an error.
  We made an error in the equation 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)).
  The correct equation should be 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) + P(A and B).
  Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B).
  Substituting this value, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B)) + 0.6 * P(B).
  Simplifying, we get 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B).
  Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / 0.4 = 0.9.
  Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.

Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, which means the fencing is required for the remaining three sides.
  The perimeter of the yard is given as 2L + W = P.
  We need to find the value of P.
  We can solve for L and W using the area equation.
  L = 240 / W
  Substituting the value of L in the perimeter equation, we get:
  2(240/W) + W = P
  480/W + W = P
  P = W^2 + 480/W
  We need to minimize the value of P to get the minimum fencing required.
  We can do that by finding the derivative of P with respect to W and equating it to zero.
  dP/dW = 2W - 480/W^2 = 0
  2W = 480/W^2
  W^3 = 240
  W = 6.83 (approx)
  L = 240 / W = 35.12 (approx)
  The perimeter of the yard is 2L + W = 76.07 (approx)
  Alice needs 76.07 meters of fencing.

  We need to find the value of P.
  We can solve for L and W using the area equation.
  L = 240 / W
  Substituting the value of L in the perimeter equation, we get:
  2(240/W) + W = P
  480/W + W = P
  P = W^2 + 480/W
  We need to minimize the value of P to get the minimum fencing required.
  We can do that by finding the derivative of P with respect to W and equating it to zero.
  dP/dW = 2W - 480/W^2 = 0
  2W = 480/W^2
  W^3 = 240
  W = 6.83 (approx)
  L = 240 / W = 35.12 (approx)
  The perimeter of the yard is 2L + W = 76.07 (approx)
  Alice needs 76.07 meters of fencing.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Thought:
- The store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls.
- If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, then the remaining 20% of the inventory must have been yellow golf balls.
- Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day "y".
- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day must have been equal to the number of white golf balls sold during the day, which is 0.5 * 0.8 * 600 = 240.
- We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so the number of yellow golf balls sold during the day is also 240.
- Therefore, the store had y + 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, which is equal to 0.2 * 600 (the number of yellow golf balls remaining after the store sold 80% of its inventory).
- Solving for y, we get y = 120.

Question: Jim filled his dog's bowl with dog food. Starting at 8:00 am, Jim's dog ate exactly once an hour, consuming exactly 1/3 of the dog food remaining in the bowl at each feeding session. Approximately, what percent of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon of the same day?
Choices:
  A: 20%
  B: 25%
  C: 30%
  D: 35%
  E: 40%
Response 0:
Thought:
  The dog ate once every hour from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm, which is 4 hours.
  At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
  Let's assume that the original amount of food in the bowl was 100 units.
  After the first hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 100 units, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units.
  Therefore, there were 100 - 33.33 = 66.67 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the second hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 66.67 units, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units.
  Therefore, there were 66.67 - 22.22 = 44.45 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the third hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 44.45 units, which is 1/3 * 44.45 = 14.82 units.
  Therefore, there were 44.45 - 14.82 = 29.63 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the fourth hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 29.63 units, which is 1/3 * 29.63 = 9.88 units.
  Therefore, there were 29.63 - 9.88 = 19.75 units of food left in the bowl.
  The original amount of food was 100 units, and there were 19.75 units left before the dog began to eat at noon.
  Therefore, the percent of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is (19.75/100) * 100% = 19.75%.
  The closest answer choice is A: 20%.

  At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
  Let's assume that the original amount of food in the bowl was 100 units.
  After the first hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 100 units, which is 1/3 * 100 = 33.33 units.
  Therefore, there were 100 - 33.33 = 66.67 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the second hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 66.67 units, which is 1/3 * 66.67 = 22.22 units.
  Therefore, there were 66.67 - 22.22 = 44.45 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the third hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 44.45 units, which is 1/3 * 44.45 = 14.82 units.
  Therefore, there were 44.45 - 14.82 = 29.63 units of food left in the bowl.
  After the fourth hour, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining 29.63 units, which is 1/3 * 29.63 = 9.88 units.
  Therefore, there were 29.63 - 9.88 = 19.75 units of food left in the bowl.
  The original amount of food was 100 units, and there were 19.75 units left before the dog began to eat at noon.
  Therefore, the percent of the original food in the bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is (19.75/100) * 100% = 19.75%.

Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the original price of each article is x.
  The price of each article decreased by 15%, so the new price of each article is 0.85x.
  Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is $300 + (5 * 0.85x).
  We can set up an equation: $300 + (5 * 0.85x) = 5x.

  The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters.
  Therefore, x + (x - 3) = 20.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 3 = 20.
  Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23.
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5.
  Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Thought:
  The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4.
  This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.
  If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can use this ratio to find the number of red sweets.
  We can start by finding the number of green sweets per unit of the ratio.
  4 units of the ratio correspond to 120 green sweets.
  Therefore, 1 unit of the ratio corresponds to 120/4 = 30 green sweets.
  Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, 1 unit of the ratio corresponds to 3 red sweets.
  Therefore, 1 unit of the ratio corresponds to 3 red sweets and 30 green sweets.
  To find the total number of red sweets, we can multiply the number of units of the ratio by 3.
  The total number of units of the ratio is 3 + 4 = 7.
  Therefore, the total number of red sweets is 3 * 30 * 7 = 630.
  The answer is D: 100.

Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
The total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96.
If 4 of them did not turn up, then the remaining number of friends is "x-4".
As a result, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
So, the total amount collected after the 4 friends did not turn up is:
96 + 4(4) = 112
The equation can be written as:
96 = (x-4)*4
Solving for x:
x = 28/3
This is not a whole number, which means it is not a possible answer.
The closest possible answer is 12.
Let's check if it satisfies the conditions:
The number of friends who attended the picnic is 12.
4 of them did not turn up, so the remaining number of friends is 8.
Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
So, the total amount collected is:
4*8 + 96 = 128
The total amount collected after 4 friends did not turn up is:
4*12 = 48
The difference between the two amounts is:
128 - 48 = 80
This is equal to the amount that the 4 friends who did not turn up were supposed to contribute:
80/4 = 20

Question: there are more than 501 students in a school such that 20% of them exactly took physics and 28% of them exactly took math. What could be the least possible no of students in the school?
Choices:
  A: 550
  B: 570
  C: 600
  D: 700
  E: none of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the least possible number of students in the school is x.
  According to the problem, 20% of the students took physics and 28% of the students took math.
  Therefore, the number of students who took physics is 0.2x and the number of students who took math is 0.28x.
  The total number of students who took either physics or math is the sum of the number of students who took physics and the number of students who took math.
  Therefore, the total number of students who took either physics or math is 0.2x + 0.28x = 0.48x.
  We know that the total number of students is more than 501.
  Therefore, 0.48x > 501.
  Solving for x, we get x > 1043.75.

Question: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which
Choices:
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  D: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  E: None
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x+y).
  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Since [x+y] ≤ [2x+2y], we have [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ [2x] + [2y].
  Therefore, L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y).
  It is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y) because L(x,y) is always less than or equal to R(x,y).
  It is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y) because we can choose x = 1/4 and y = 3/4.
  Therefore, the answer is A: L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Question: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
Choices:
  A: 2.6m
  B: 3.9m
  C: 4m
  D: 4.2m
  E: 4.4m
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m.
  The cost of 1 meter of the paper is Rs.2.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with the given paper is Rs.4.
  Therefore, (9x^2 - 15) * 4 = 260.

  x + y = 1000        (Equation 2)
  We can use Equation 2 to solve for one of the variables, say x:
  x = 1000 - y
  We can substitute this value of x into Equation 1 and simplify:
  (1000 - y)^2 - y^2 = 256000
  1000000 - 2000y + y^2 - y^2 = 256000
  1000000 - 2000y = 256000
  -2000y = -744000
  y = 372
  We can substitute this value of y into Equation 2 to find x:
  x + 372 = 1000
  x = 628
  Therefore, the two numbers are 628 and 372.

Choices:
  A: y/400
  B: 4y
  C: 50y
  D: 2500/y
  E: 5000/y
Response 0:
Thought:
  If x is m percent of 4y, then x = (m/100) * 4y = 4my/100.
  We need to find m as a percentage of x, which is m/x * 100.

  A: 3km
  B: 2km
  C: 4km
  D: 5km
  E: 6km
Response 0:
Thought:
  A starts from a point and travels 3km south, which means A is 3km away from the starting point in the south direction.
  Then A travels 5km towards east, which means A is 5km away from the starting point in the east direction.
  After that, A travels 3km towards north, which means A is 3km away from the starting point in the north direction.
  Finally, A travels 2km towards west, which means A is 2km away from the starting point in the west direction.
  We can draw a diagram to visualize the path of A.

  From the diagram, we can see that A has formed a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3km, 5km, and 2km.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the distance between A and the starting point.
  c^2 = a^2 + b^2, where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.
  c^2 = 3^2 + 5^2
  c^2 = 9 + 25
  c^2 = 34
  c = sqrt(34)

  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the value that makes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 true.
  We can simplify (a - b)2 as follows:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab

  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2
  Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the value that makes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 true.
  We can simplify (a - b)2 as follows:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2
  Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the value that makes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 true.
  We can simplify (a - b)2 as follows:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2
  Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the value that makes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 true.
  We can simplify (a - b)2 as follows:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2
  Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).

Question: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes above and below that value.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is equal to the sum of the incomes above $3000.
  Let's assume that there are x incomes below $3000 and y incomes above $3000.
  Then, we have the following equations:
    x + y = n
    3000x = 6000y
    x = 2y
  Substituting x = 2y into the first equation, we get:
    3y = n
  We also know that the total income of the family is $9000, so:
    3000x + 3000y = 9000
    x + y = 3
    2y + y = 3
    y = 1
    x = 2
    n = 3y = 3
  Therefore, there are 3 members in the family.

    3000x + 3000y = 9000
    x + y = 3
    2y + y = 3
    y = 1
    x = 2
    n = 3y = 3
  Therefore, there are 3 members in the family.
  The answer is B: 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes above and below that value.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is equal to the sum of the incomes above $3000.
  Let's assume that there are x incomes below $3000 and y incomes above $3000.
  Then, we have the following equations:
    x + y = n
    3000x = 6000y
    x = 2y
  Substituting x = 2y into the first equation, we get:
    3y = n
  We also know that the total income of the family is $9000, so:
    3000x + 3000y = 9000
    x + y = 3
    2y + y = 3
    y = 1
    x = 2
    n = 3y = 3
  Therefore, there are 3 members in the family.

Question: A starts a business with Rs.40,000. After 2 months, B joined him with Rs.60,000. C joined them after some more time with Rs.120,000. At the end of the year, out of a total profit of Rs.375,000, C gets Rs.150,000 as his share. How many months after B joined the business, did C join?
Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume C joined the business after x months.
  A invested for the entire year, B invested for (12-2)=10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  The ratio of their investments is (A:B:C) = (40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x))
  The ratio of their profits is the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is P.
  Then, P/C's investment = Total profit/Total investment
  P/(120000*(12-x)) = 375000/(40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12-x))
  Solving for x, we get x=4.

Response 7:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers are x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k-1.
  We know that the sum of these integers is 51.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
  x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51
  kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51
  kx + (k^2-k)/2 = 51
  k(2x+k-1) = 102
  We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50.
  Substituting x = -50 in the above equation, we get:
  k(-100+k-1) = 102
  k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0

Topic: Math
Question: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain?
Choices:
  A: y/(1200xy)
  B: 20xy/w
  C: 5xy/(12w)
  D: w/(3xy)
  E: 3y/(wx)
Response 0:
Thought:
  The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds.
  We can find the rate in gallons per minute by multiplying the rate in gallons per second by 60.
  The rate in gallons per second is w/25 gallons every x seconds, which is (w/25)*(1/x) gallons per second.
  Therefore, the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25)*(1/x)*60 gallons per minute, which simplifies to 12w/x gallons per minute.
  To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can use the formula:
  time = amount/rate
  where amount is y gallons and rate is 12w/x gallons per minute.
  Therefore, time = y/(12w/x) = yx/(12w) = 5xy/(12w).
  The answer is C: 5xy/(12w).

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
  After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4) * x = x^2 - 4x.
  When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two triangles are formed.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
  Let's assume that the base of each triangle is b feet and the height of each triangle is h feet.
  Then, (1/2) * b * h = 70.
  Therefore, b * h = 140.
  The base and height of each triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which has a length of sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2).
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x.
  We need to find x to calculate the perimeter.
  Let's solve for x using the given information.
  sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2) = sqrt(2) * b
  (x-4)^2 + x^2 = 2b^2
  2x^2 - 8x + 16 = 2b^2
  x^2 - 4x + 8 = b^2
  b * h = 140
  b^2 + h^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
  b^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  b^2 + h^2 = 2b^2 - 8x + 16
  h^2 = b^2 - 8x + 16
  h^2 = x^2 - 4x + 8 - 8x + 16
  h^2 = x^2 - 12x + 24
  b^2 = x^2 - h^2
  b^2 = x^2 - (x^2 - 12x + 24)
  b^2 = 12x - 24
  (12x - 24) * h = 140
  h = 140 / (12x - 24)
  h^2 = 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2
  x^2 - 12x + 24 + 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  x^2 - 4x + 8 - 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2 = 0
  Let's solve this equation using numerical methods.
  We can use the Newton-Raphson method to find the root of this equation.
  Let's start with an initial guess of x = 10.
  The derivative of the equation is (2x - 4) + 280^2 / (12x - 24)^3.
  Using the Newton-Raphson method, we get x = 10.98.
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 43.92.
  The closest answer choice is D: 62.

  b^2 = 12x - 24
  (12x - 24) * h = 140
  h = 140 / (12x - 24)
  h^2 = 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2
  x^2 - 12x + 24 + 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  x^2 - 4x + 8 - 140^2 / (12x - 24)^2 = 0

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that hose A fills 1/x of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, which means that 8/x of the pool is filled in 1 hour.
  In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/x of the pool.
  In the next 3 hours, both hoses fill the remaining 6/x of the pool.
  Let's assume that hose B fills 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, both hoses together fill 1/x + 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  We know that both hoses together filled 6/x of the pool in 3 hours.
  Therefore, 1/x + 1/y = 6/(3x) = 2/x.
  Solving for y, we get y = 2x.
  We need to find how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool, which is 1/x + 1/y = 1/x + 1/(2x) = 3/2x.
  Therefore, hose B can fill the entire pool in 2/3 of 8 hours, which is 16/3 hours.

  Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can substitute that value in for x and solve for m.
  1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3
  Square both sides: m^2 - 88 = 9 - 6m + m^2
  Simplify: 6m = 97
  Solve for m: m = 97/6
  Therefore, the value of m is approximately 16.17, which is closest to D: -16.2.

  If two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a third number, then their difference is divisible by that number.
  Let's find the difference between 2272 and 875: 2272 - 875 = 1397.
  Let's assume the 3-digit number is N.
  We know that 1397 is divisible by N.
  The factors of 1397 are 1, 17,  82, and  1397.
  The factors of N must also be factors of 1397.
  The only 3-digit factor of 1397 is 17.
  Therefore, N = 17.
  The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 7 = 8.

  Jack finished two-thirds of the work.
  Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work is left for Jill to complete.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining one-third of the work.
  Therefore, Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/x.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means that one-third of the work is left.
  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1/12.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means that he cleaned (2/3) of the yacht.
  Therefore, the remaining one-third of the yacht is (1/3).
  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1/12, which means that he cleaned (2/3) of the yacht in (2/3)*12 = 8 hours.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining one-third of the work.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning, which means that Jill's rate of cleaning is (5/100)* (1/12) = 1/240.
  Therefore, Jill can clean (1/3) of the yacht in x hours.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 1/240, which means that she can clean (1/3) of the yacht in (1/240)*(3) = (1/80) hours.

  Total time taken = 10.5 + 10.5 = 21 hours
  The answer is A: 22 hrs.

Thought:
  Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 'x' hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is also 'x' hours.
  According to the problem, Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.
  Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Sam = time taken to go by train + time taken to return by car
  Total time taken = x + x = 2x
  Total time taken - 4 hours = 17 hours (as per the problem)
  2x - 4 = 17
  2x = 21
  x = 10.5
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 10.5 hours.
  The time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is also 10.5 hours.
  Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways = time taken to go by car + time taken to return by car
  Total time taken = 10.5 + 10.5 = 21 hours
  The answer is A: 22 hrs.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  We can start by trying the answer choices:
  - If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 80 = 260 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 260. By solving this equation, we get x = 3 and y = 8. This means that she brought 4 copper coins, which is not the minimum number.
  - If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 60 = 280 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 280. By solving this equation, we get x = 2 and y = 10. This means that she brought 3 copper coins, which is the minimum number.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 3.

Thought:
  Let the three digit number be represented by abc.
  Then, a + b + c = 17  ---(1)
  Also, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109  ---(2)
  If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495
  Therefore, a - c = 5  ---(3)

  From (1) and (3), we get a + c = 12.
  From (2), we know that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Substituting b = 6, we get a^2 + c^2 = 73.
  We can now use trial and error to find the values of a and c that satisfy the above equations.
  We get a = 8 and c = 4.
  Therefore, the number is 864.
  We can verify that 864 - 495 = 369, which is the reverse of 864.

  If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495
  Therefore, a - c = 5  ---(3)
  From (1) and (3), we get 2b = 12, which implies b = 6.
  From (1) and (3), we get a + c = 12.
  From (2), we know that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Substituting b = 6, we get a^2 + c^2 = 73.
  We can now use trial and error to find the values of a and c that satisfy the above equations.
  We get a = 8 and c = 4.
  Therefore, the number is 864.

  The trader sold the article at a profit of 20%, which means the selling price is 120% of the cost price.
  Selling price = 120% of cost price = (120/100)*x = 1.2x
  The selling price is given as Rs.360.
  Therefore, 1.2x = 360
  Solving for x, we get x = 300.
  Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.300.

Question: A newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 the rest of the days of the week. If a hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week and pays $210 per week for newspapers, how many newspapers does it buy on Monday?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 30
  C: 45
  D: 60
  E: 75

Thought:
- Let's call the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday "x".
- The hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so it orders "2y" newspapers on the other days of the week.
- The cost of the newspapers on Sunday is $4 per newspaper, and the cost of the newspapers on the other days of the week is $1 per newspaper.
- The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 1(2y * 7) = 210
- Simplifying the equation: 4x + 14y = 210
- We need to find the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, which is the same as the number of newspapers it buys on any other day of the week. Let's call this number "y".
- We can use the equation 4x + 14y = 210 to solve for "y".
- We know that x = 2y, so we can substitute 2y for x in the equation: 4(2y) + 14y = 210
- Simplifying the equation: 22y = 210
- Solving for "y": y = 9.55 (rounded to two decimal places)
- The hotel cannot buy a fraction of a newspaper, so it must buy either 9 or 10 newspapers on Monday.
- Let's check both options:
  - If the hotel buys 9 newspapers on Monday, it buys 2 * 9 = 18 newspapers on Sunday, and 2 * 7 * y = 2 * 7 * 9.55 = 133.7 newspapers on the other days of the week. The total cost would be 18 * 4 + 133.7 * 1 = $197.8, which is less than $210.
  - If the hotel buys 10 newspapers on Monday, it buys 2 * 10 = 20 newspapers on Sunday, and 2 * 7 * y = 2 * 7 * 9.55 = 133.7 newspapers on the other days of the week. The total cost would be 20 * 4 + 133.7 * 1 = $201.8, which is still less than $210.
- Therefore, the hotel buys 10 newspapers on Monday.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km
  E: 48km
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km.
  Let's assume the time taken by Allen to reach Y is t hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours.
  Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km
  Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km
  Distance covered by Allen in returning from Y to X = 54t km
  Distance covered by Bob in returning from X to Y = 78t km
  Total distance covered by Bob = 78t + 78t = 156t km
  Total distance covered by Allen = 54t + 54t = 108t km
  Bob covers 48 km more than Allen in the same time.

Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?

  E: 59
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies after n days is 2^(n/2).
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  Therefore, 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days if there was initially one lily.
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the number of lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.
  Therefore, 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30.

  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.
  Therefore, 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30.
  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^25.
  Taking the square of both sides, we get 2^n = 2^50.
  Therefore, n = 50.
  The answer is 50 days.

Question: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
Choices:
  A: 1 hr 23 min
  B: 1 hr 15 min
  C: 1 hr 8 min
  D: 56 min
  E: 55 min
Response 0:
Thought:
  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train N's departure.
  Distance covered by Train M in x hours = Distance covered by Train N in (x-2) hours.
  Distance covered by Train M in 4 hours = Distance covered by Train N in (4-2) = 2 hours.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Distance covered by Train M = S1 * 4
  Distance covered by Train N = S2 * (x-2)
  Distance covered by Train M = Distance covered by Train N
  S1 * 4 = S2 * (x-2)
  x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2)
  The two trains meet x hours after Train N's departure, which is 7 am.
  Therefore, the two trains meet at 7:00 + x hours.
  To find x, we need to know the ratio of the speeds of the two trains.
  Let's assume that the ratio of the speeds of the two trains is 3:4.
  Therefore, S1/S2 = 3/4
  x = (4*3 + 6) / (2*4) = 3

Question: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 48
  C: 50
  D: 55
  E: 58
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  From the first statement, we know that J + S + F = 100.
  From the second statement, we know that when J = F, S + (F - S) * 2 = 2S.
  Simplifying the second statement, we get F - S = S, which means F = 2S.
  From the third statement, we know that when J = F, F = 2(S - F + J).
  Simplifying the third statement, we get F = 2J - S.
  Now we have two equations for F: F = 2S and F = 2J - S.
  Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2S = 2J - S, which means J = 3S/2.
  Substituting J = 3S/2 into the first equation, we get 5S/2 + F = 100.
  Substituting F = 2S into the above equation, we get 5S/2 + 2S = 100, which gives us S = 20.
  Substituting S = 20 into F = 2S, we get F = 40.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 40.

Question: Christopher and Jonathan were having bets. They decide that a coin will be flipped twenty times and each time it turns heads, Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan and each time it turns out to be Tails, Jonathan will give 3$ to Christopher. After flipping for twenty times none of the both won or lost any amount.
How many times did the coin landed on Heads ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 23
  C: 16
  D: 18
  E: 12
Response 0:
Thought:
  Christopher gives $2 to Jonathan each time the coin lands on Heads.
  Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher each time the coin lands on Tails.
  Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times and Tails y times.
  Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times.
  Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher y times.
  Christopher gave a total of 2x dollars to Jonathan.
  Jonathan gave a total of 3y dollars to Christopher.
  Since none of them won or lost any amount, the total amount of money given by Christopher should be equal to the total amount of money given by Jonathan.
  Therefore, 2x = 3y.
  We know that x + y = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times).
  We can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.
  Multiplying the first equation by 20/6, we get:
  (20/6) * 2x = (20/6) * 3y
  Simplifying, we get:
  (10/3) * x = (10/2) * y
  Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
  (1/3) * x = (1/2) * y
  Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:
  2x = 3y
  Therefore, x = 3k and y = 2k for some integer k.
  Since x + y = 20, we have:
  3k + 2k = 20
  Solving for k, we get:
  k = 4
  Therefore, x = 3k = 12 and y = 2k = 8.

  Jonathan gives $3 to Christopher each time the coin lands on Tails.
  Let's assume that the coin landed on Heads x times and Tails y times.
  Christopher gave $2 to Jonathan x times.
  Jonathan gave $3 to Christopher y times.
  Christopher gave a total of 2x dollars to Jonathan.
  Jonathan gave a total of 3y dollars to Christopher.
  Since none of them won or lost any amount, the total amount of money given by Christopher should be equal to the total amount of money given by Jonathan.
  Therefore, 2x = 3y.
  We know that x + y = 20 (since the coin was flipped 20 times).
  We can solve these two equations to find the values of x and y.
  Multiplying the first equation by 20/6, we get:
  (20/6) * 2x = (20/6) * 3y
  Simplifying, we get:
  (10/3) * x = (10/2) * y
  Dividing both sides by 10, we get:
  (1/3) * x = (1/2) * y
  Multiplying both sides by 6, we get:
  2x = 3y
  Therefore, x = 3k and y = 2k for some integer k.
  Since x + y = 20, we have:
  3k + 2k = 20
  Solving for k, we get:
  k = 4
  Therefore, x = 3k = 12 and y = 2k = 8.
  The coin landed on Heads 12 times.

  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
  According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
  Multiplying 3 with the number "1abcde" gives us 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e.
  Multiplying the number "abcde1" with 1 gives us 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e + 1.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e = 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e + 1.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 20000a + 2000b + 200c + 20d + 2e = 99999.
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 49999.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so a cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of a, we get that a = 4 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting a = 4 in the equation, we get 4000 + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 49999.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 45999.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so b cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of b, we get that b = 2 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting b = 2 in the equation, we get 1000c + 10d + e = 3599.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so c cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of c, we get that c = 5 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting c = 5 in the equation, we get 10d + e = 99.
  Trying different values of d and e, we get that d = 6 and e = 7 satisfy the equation.

  According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
  Multiplying 3 with the number "1abcde" gives us 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e.
  Multiplying the number "abcde1" with 1 gives us 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e + 1.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e = 100000 + 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e + 1.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 20000a + 2000b + 200c + 20d + 2e = 99999.
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 49999.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so a cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of a, we get that a = 4 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting a = 4 in the equation, we get 4000 + 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 49999.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 1000b + 100c + 10d + e = 45999.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so b cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of b, we get that b = 2 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting b = 2 in the equation, we get 1000c + 10d + e = 3599.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so c cannot be 0.
  Trying different values of c, we get that c = 5 satisfies the equation.
  Substituting c = 5 in the equation, we get 10d + e = 99.
  Trying different values of d and e, we get that d = 6 and e = 7 satisfy the equation.
  Therefore, the number is 42567.

Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Thought:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
The total number of people receiving the money is 5+4+2 = 11.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
We can set up an equation to solve for x:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying the equation, we get:
35x = 8600
x = 8600/35
x = 246.29 (approx)
Each daughter receives 4x = 4*246.29 = 985.16 (approx)
Therefore, each daughter receives approximately Rs 985. Answer("None of the above")

Response 0:
Thought:
  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's assume that the maximum distance we can travel is x miles.
  The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, which means we have $5.00 left to spend on the remaining distance.
  The remaining distance is (x - 0.25) miles.
  For each additional quarter mile, the cab charges 10 cents, which is equivalent to $0.10/0.25 = $0.40 per mile.
  Therefore, the cost of the remaining distance is $0.40(x - 0.25).
  The total cost of the trip is $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25).
  We want to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50, which means we need to solve the equation:
  $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25) = $8.50

Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  We know that the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  We also know that 40 employees take both vacations, so we need to subtract them from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation to get the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  Therefore, Q = 80 - 40 = 40.
  So, 40% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  The answer is B: 15%.

- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
- Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total number of hours available is 3x.
- The number of large cakes required is 20, and the number of small cakes required is 700.
- The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 2x * 3x = 6x^2.
- The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 35x * 3x = 105x^2.
- We need to solve for x in the following equation: 6x^2 >= 20 and 105x^2 >= 700.
- The first inequality gives us x >= sqrt(20/6) = 1.825.
- The second inequality gives us x >= sqrt(700/105) = 2.645.
- The minimum value of x that satisfies both inequalities is x = 3.
- Therefore, we need 3 helpers to make the required number of cakes.

Question: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
Choices:
  A: 43 seconds
  B: 39 seconds
  C: 20 seconds
  D: 33 seconds
  E: 55 seconds
Response 0:
Thought:
  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.
  The tunnel is 1 mile long.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  The distance is the length of the tunnel, which is 1 mile.
  We need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  Then we can plug in the values and solve for time.
  time = 1 / (120/3600) = 0.025 hours = 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds.
  However, we need to add the 3 seconds it takes for the train to enter the tunnel.
  Therefore, the total time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is 90 + 3 = 93 seconds.
  The answer is not one of the choices.

Question: At what price should the Karan mark a sewing machine that costs him Rs. 1200/- so that even after offering a 20% discount, he makes 20% profit?
Choices:
  A: 1,879
  B: 1,875
  C: 1,876
  D: 1,872
  E: 1,800
Response 0:
Thought:
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit even after offering a 20% discount.
  Let's assume the marked price is M.
  The selling price after a 20% discount would be 0.8M.
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit, so the cost price for him would be 1200*1.2 = 1440.
  The selling price should be greater than or equal to the cost price plus the profit, which is 1440*1.2 = 1728.
  0.8M >= 1728
  M >= 2160
  Therefore, the marked price should be at least Rs. 2160.
  However, we need to find the exact marked price.
  Let's assume the marked price is Rs. X.
  After a 20% discount, the selling price would be 0.8X.
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit, so the cost price for him would be 1200*1.2 = 1440.
  0.8X = 1.2*1440
  X = 1.2*1440/0.8

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.
Solving for x, we get x = 4000.
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day is 4000.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Thought:
  If A and B are independent events, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs.
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)
  We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
  We can use these values to find P(neither A nor B) and then use that to find P(B).
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
  0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
  0.96 - 0.6 = -0.2P(B)
  0.36 = -0.2P(B)
  P(B) = -0.36 / -0.2 = 1.8
  This is not a valid probability, so we made an error.
  We know that P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) <= 1, so we can use this to check our work.
  0.6 + P(B) - P(A and B) <= 1
  P(B) - P(A and B) <= 0.4
  Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B).
  P(B) - 0.6P(B) <= 0.4
  0.4P(B) <= 0.4
  P(B) <= 1
  This is a valid probability, so our answer is correct.
  P(B) = 0.4 + 0.6P(B) = 0.6(1 + P(B))
  P(B) / (1 + P(B)) = 0.4 / 0.6 = 2 / 3
  P(B) = (2 / 3)P(B) + (2 / 3)(1 - P(B))
  P(B) = 2 - 2P(B)

  P(B) - 0.6P(B) <= 0.4
  0.4P(B) <= 0.4
  P(B) <= 1
  This is a valid probability, so our answer is correct.
  P(B) = 0.4 + 0.6P(B) = 0.6(1 + P(B))
  P(B) / (1 + P(B)) = 0.4 / 0.6 = 2 / 3

  The proportion will be: height of flagstaff / length of its shadow = height of building / length of its shadow
  We can plug in the given values and solve for 'x'.
  height of flagstaff = 17.5 m
  length of its shadow = 40.25 m
  length of shadow of building = 28.75 m
  height of building = x
  17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75
  x = (17.5 x 28.75) / 40.25
  x = 12.5
  Therefore, the height of the building is 12.5 meters.

Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, which means the fencing is required for the remaining three sides.
  The perimeter of the yard is given as 2L + W = P.
  We need to find the value of P.
  We can solve for L and W using the area equation.
  L * W = 240, so W = 240/L.
  Substituting the value of W in the perimeter equation, we get P = 2L + 240/L.
  We can differentiate the perimeter equation with respect to L and find the value of L that minimizes the perimeter.
  Differentiating P with respect to L, we get dP/dL = 2 - 240/L^2.
  Setting dP/dL = 0, we get L = sqrt(240).
  Substituting the value of L in the perimeter equation, we get P = 2*sqrt(240) + 20.
  Therefore, Alice needs 2*sqrt(240) + 20 meters of fencing.
  Approximating the value of 2*sqrt(240) + 20, we get 58.4, which is closest to 58.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 58.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?

- Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day "y".
- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day must have been equal to the number of white golf balls sold during the day, which is 0.5 * 0.8 * 600 = 240.
- We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so the number of yellow golf balls sold during the day is also 240.
- Therefore, the store had y + 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, which is equal to 0.2 * 600 (the number of yellow golf balls remaining after the store sold 80% of its inventory).

- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day must have been equal to the number of white golf balls sold during the day, which is 0.5 * 0.8 * 600 = 240.
- We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so the number of yellow golf balls sold during the day is also 240.
- Therefore, the store had y + 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, which is equal to 0.2 * 600 (the number of yellow golf balls remaining after the store sold 80% of its inventory).
- Solving for y, we get y = 120.
- Therefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
  Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
  The sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters.
  Therefore, x + (x - 3) = 20.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 2x - 3 = 20.
  Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23.
  Dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5.

If 4 of them did not turn up, then the remaining number of friends is "x-4".
Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, which means the total amount collected was Rs. 96 + Rs. 4(x-4).
We can create an equation from the information above: Rs. 96 = Rs. 4(x-4) + Rs. 96.
Solving for "x", we get x = 16.
Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic was 16.

Question: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which
Choices:
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  D: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  E: None
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x+y).
  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Since [x+y] ≤ [2x+2y], we have [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ [2x] + [2y].
  Therefore, L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y).
  It is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y) because L(x,y) is always less than or equal to R(x,y).
  It is possible to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y) because we can choose x = 1/4 and y = 3/4.

  x + y = 1000        (Equation 2)
  We can use Equation 2 to solve for one of the variables, say x:
  x = 1000 - y
  We can substitute this value of x in Equation 1 and simplify:
  (1000 - y)^2 - y^2 = 256000
  1000000 - 2000y + y^2 - y^2 = 256000

  We need to find m as a percentage of x, which is m/x * 100.
  Substituting the value of x, we get m/(4my/100) * 100 = 25.
  Therefore, m is 25% of x.
  To express this in terms of y, we can substitute the value of x in terms of y, which is x = 4my/100.
  Therefore, m is (25/4)y percent of x in terms of y.
  Simplifying, we get m is (6.25)y percent of x in terms of y.
  The answer is not one of the given choices.
  The closest answer is A: y/400, which is (0.25)y percent of x in terms of y.
  Therefore, the answer is A: y/400.

Question: A sales person gets a 10% commission on each sale he makes. How many sales of $250 each must he make in order to reach a salary of at least $1000?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 24
  C: 25
  D: 40
  E: 52
Response 0:
Thought:
  The salesperson gets a 10% commission on each sale.
  Let's assume the number of sales he needs to make is "x".
  The total commission he will earn is 10% of 250 times "x", which is 25 times "x".
  The total salary he will earn is the sum of his commission and his base salary, which is $1000.
  Therefore, the equation is 25x + base salary = $1000.
  We need to solve for "x".
  Base salary is not given, so we assume it is $0.
  Therefore, 25x = $1000.
  Solving for "x", we get x = 40.
  Therefore, the salesperson needs to make 40 sales of $250 each to reach a salary of at least $1000.

  A starts from a point and travels south 3km, which means A is 3km away from the starting point.
  Then A travels 5km towards east, which means A is 5km away from the starting point in the east direction.
  After that, A travels 3km towards north, which means A is 3km away from the starting point in the north direction.
  Finally, A travels 2km towards west, which means A is 2km away from the starting point in the west direction.

Question: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?
a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2
Choices:
  A: (a + b)(a - b)
  B: (a - b)2
  C: (a + b)2
  D: a3 + b3
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the value that makes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 true.
  We can simplify (a - b)2 as follows:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2

  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can substitute this into the equation and simplify:
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = (a2 - 2ab + b2) + 2ab
  (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - ab + b2

  Therefore, 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 11(a + 3c) = 30.
  Since a and c are integers, the only possible values for (a + 3c) are 1, 2, and 3.
  If (a + 3c) = 1, then a = -8, which is not possible.
  If (a + 3c) = 2, then a = -7, which is not possible.

Question: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes above and below that value.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is also $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes is $9000.
  Therefore, the sum of the incomes above $3000 is $3000 as well.
  There are (n-1)/2 incomes above $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes above $3000 is ((n-1)/2) * $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes below $3000 is also ((n-1)/2) * $3000.
  The total sum of all the incomes is $9000.
  Therefore, ((n-1)/2) * $3000 + ((n-1)/2) * $3000 = $9000.

  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes above and below that value.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is also $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes is $9000.
  Therefore, the sum of the incomes above $3000 is $3000 as well.
  There are (n-1)/2 incomes above $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes above $3000 is ((n-1)/2) * $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes below $3000 is also ((n-1)/2) * $3000.
  The total sum of all the incomes is $9000.
  Therefore, ((n-1)/2) * $3000 + ((n-1)/2) * $3000 = $9000.
  Simplifying the equation, we get (n-1) * $3000 = $9000.

  We need to find the monthly sales x so that her monthly salary reaches $1500.
  Therefore, 1500 = 500 + 0.05x
  Solving for x, we get x = (1500 - 500) / 0.05 = 20000
  Therefore, the monthly sales should be $20000.

Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers are x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k-1.
  We know that the sum of these integers is 51.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
  x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
  Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:
  kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51
  kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51
  kx + (k^2-k)/2 = 51
  k(2x+k-1) = 102
  We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50.
  Substituting x = -50 in the above equation, we get:
  k(-100+k-1) = 102
  k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0
  Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
  k = 3 or k = 96
  We can eliminate k = 3 because the sum of 3 consecutive integers starting from -50 is -50 + (-49) + (-48) = -147, which is not equal to 51.
  Therefore, the answer is k = 96.

Topic: Math
Question: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain?
Choices:
  A: y/(1200xy)
  B: 20xy/w
  C: 5xy/(12w)
  D: w/(3xy)
  E: 3y/(wx)
Response 0:
Thought:
  The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds.
  We can find the rate in gallons per minute by multiplying the rate in gallons per second by 60.
  The rate in gallons per second is w/25 gallons every x seconds, which is (w/25)*(1/x) gallons per second.
  Therefore, the rate in gallons per minute is (w/25)*(1/x)*60 gallons per minute, which simplifies to 12w/x gallons per minute.
  To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can use the formula:
  time = amount/rate
  where amount is y gallons and rate is 12w/x gallons per minute.
  Therefore, time = y/(12w/x) = yx/(12w) = 5xy/(12w).

  To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can use the formula:
  time = amount/rate
  where amount is y gallons and rate is 12w/x gallons per minute.
  Therefore, time = y/(12w/x) = yx/(12w) = 5xy/(12w).
  The answer is C: 5xy/(12w).

Question: A square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, which is then cut diagonally in half to create two triangles. If the area of each of triangle is 70 square feet, what was the perimeter (in feet) of the original piece of square cloth?
Choices:
  A: 56
  B: 58
  C: 60
  D: 62
  E: 64
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
  After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4) * x = x^2 - 4x.
  When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two triangles are formed.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
  Let's assume that the base of each triangle is b feet and the height of each triangle is h feet.
  Then, (1/2) * b * h = 70.
  Therefore, b * h = 140.
  The base and height of each triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which has a length of sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2).
  Therefore, (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2.
  Substituting b * h = 140, we get (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Solving for b and h, we get b = 2h/x and h = 2b/x.
  Substituting these into b * h = 140, we get (2h/x) * (2b/x) = 140, which simplifies to h * b = (x^2)/10.
  Substituting h = 2b/x, we get b^2 = (x^2)/20.
  Substituting this into (b^2 + h^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16, we get (x^2)/10 + (4b^2)/(x^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Multiplying both sides by (x^2)/10, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 16x^2 - 280x + 640 = 0.
  Factoring out (x-10), we get (x-10)(x^3 - 8x^2 - 160x + 64) = 0.
  The only positive root of this equation is x = 16.
  Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 16 feet.
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 * 16 = 64 feet.

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that hose A fills 1/x of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, which means that 8/x of the pool is filled in 1 hour.
  In the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/x of the pool.
  In the next 3 hours, both hoses fill the remaining 6/x of the pool.
  Let's assume that hose B fills 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, both hoses together fill 1/x + 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  We know that both hoses together filled 6/x of the pool in 3 hours.
  Therefore, 1/x + 1/y = 6/(3x) = 2/x.
  Solving for y, we get y = 2x.

Topic: Math
Question: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m?
Choices:
  A: -23.5
  B: -17.5
  C: -10.5
  D: -16.2
  E: Cannot be determined
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5.
  Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for the other root: x = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4(1)(22))) / 2(1)
  Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can substitute that value in for x and solve for m.
  1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3
  Square both sides: m^2 - 88 = 9 - 6m + m^2
  Simplify: 6m = 97
  Solve for m: m = 97/6
  Therefore, the value of m is approximately 16.17, which is closest to D: -16.2.

Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11
  C: 12

Response 0:
Thought:
  If two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a third number, then their difference is divisible by that number.
  Let's find the difference between 2272 and 875: 2272 - 875 = 1397.
  Let's assume the 3-digit number is N.
  We know that 1397 is divisible by N.
  The factors of 1397 are 1, 17,  82, and  1397.
  The factors of N must also be factors of 1397.
  The only 3-digit factor of 1397 is 17.
  Therefore, N = 17.
  The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 7 = 8.

Choices:
  A: 22 hrs
  B: 18 hrs
  C: 16 hrs
  D: 20 hrs
  E: 13 hrs
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 'x' hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is (17 - x) hours.
  According to the problem, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours.
  So, the total time taken by Mr. Sam if he goes both ways by train is (2x + 4) hours.

Response 5:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 'x' hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is (17 - x) hours.
  According to the problem, if he goes both ways by train, he loses 4 hours.
  So, the total time taken by Mr. Sam if he goes both ways by train is (2x + 4) hours.
  The total time taken by Mr. Sam if he goes by train to the city and returns by car is (x + 17 - x) = 17 hours.
  Therefore, (2x + 4) = 17.
  Solving the above equation, we get x = 6.5.
  So, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is (17 - 6.5) = 10.5 hours.
  Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Sam if he had traveled by car in both ways is (2 * 10.5) = 21 hours.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  We can start by trying the answer choices:
  - If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 80 = 260 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 260. By solving this equation, we get x = 3 and y = 8. This means that she brought 4 copper coins, which is not the minimum number.
  - If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 60 = 280 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 280. By solving this equation, we get x = 2 and y = 10. This means that she brought 3 copper coins, which is the minimum number.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 3.

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let the three digit number be represented by abc.
  Then, a + b + c = 17  ---(1)
  Also, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109  ---(2)
  If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495
  Therefore, a - c = 5  ---(3)
  From (1) and (3), we get 2b = 12, which implies b = 6.
  From (1) and (3), we get a + c = 12.
  From (2), we know that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Substituting b = 6, we get a^2 + c^2 = 73.
  We can now use trial and error to find the values of a and c that satisfy the above equations.
  We get a = 8 and c = 4.
  Therefore, the number is 864.
  We can verify that 864 - 495 = 369, which is the reverse of 864.

Question: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
Choices:
  A: 50
  B: 70
  C: 75
  D: 100
  E: 125
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem.
  Let's use the following variables:
    - V: number of files infected by a virus
    - W: number of files infected by a worm
    - B: number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
  From the problem, we know that:
    - V + W - B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
    - V = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the first equation to solve for B: B = V + W - 250
  We can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get: V + W - B = 125
  We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: W = 2.5B
  We can substitute the second and fourth equations into the first equation to get: 3.5B = 125
  Solving for B, we get: B = 35
  Substituting B into the second equation, we get: W = 87.5
  Substituting V and W into the first equation, we get: V = 127.5
  The number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V - B = 127.5 - 35 = 92.5
  The answer is not one of the choices, but the closest one is E: 125.

    - V + W - B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
    - V = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the first equation to solve for B: B = V + W - 250
  We can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get: V + W - B = 125
  We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: W = 2.5B
  We can substitute the second and fourth equations into the first equation to get: 3.5B = 125
  Solving for B, we get: B = 35
  Substituting B into the second equation, we get: W = 87.5
  Substituting V and W into the first equation, we get: V = 127.5
  The number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V - B = 127.5 - 35 = 92.5
  The answer is not one of the choices, but the closest one is E: 125.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.

  Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km.
  Let's assume the time taken by Allen to reach Y is t hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Bob to reach X is also t hours.
  Distance covered by Allen in t hours = 54t km
  Distance covered by Bob in t hours = 78t km
  Once Allen reaches Y, he returns to X. Therefore, the distance covered by Allen in the second half of the journey is also 54t km.
  Once Bob reaches X, he returns to Y. Therefore, the distance covered by Bob in the second half of the journey is also 78t km.
  Total distance covered by Bob = 78t + 78t = 156t km

Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies after n days is 2^(n/2).
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  Therefore, 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days if there was initially one lily.
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the number of lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.
  Therefore, 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30.
  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^25.
  Taking the square of both sides, we get 2^n = 2^50.
  Therefore, n = 50.
  The answer is 50 days.

  Therefore, 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days if there was initially one lily.
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the number of lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.
  Therefore, 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30.
  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^25.
  Taking the square of both sides, we get 2^n = 2^50.
  Therefore, n = 50.
  The answer is 50 days.

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train N's departure.
  Distance covered by Train M in x hours = Distance covered by Train N in (x-2) hours.
  Distance covered by Train M in 4 hours = Distance covered by Train N in (4-2) = 2 hours.

Choices:
  A: 10/7
  B: 20/7
  C: 30/7
  D: 40/7
  E: 50/7
Response 0:
Thought:
- The mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
- We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.
- This means we want the mixture to contain 50% sand and 50% clay.
- We need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
- Let's assume we remove x kg of the mixture.
- The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is 0.3(10 - x) kg.
- We want to add x kg of pure sand to the mixture.
- The total amount of sand in the new mixture will be 0.3(10 - x) + x kg.

Topic: Math
Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  L+B = 170 meters.
  The length of the plot covered by gardening will be L+2 and the breadth will be B+2.
  The area of the gardening plot will be (L+2)(B+2) square meters.
  The cost of gardening per square meter is 10.
  Therefore, the total cost of gardening will be 10(L+2)(B+2).
  We can't determine the exact values of L and B from the given information.
  However, we can use the fact that the area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  We know that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.
  We also know that 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  Therefore, L+B = 170 meters.
  We can use this information to find the value of LB.
  L+B = 170
  L = 170 - B
  Substituting L in terms of B in the equation LB = Area, we get:
  B(170 - B) = Area
  170B - B^2 = Area
  We still can't determine the exact value of Area, but we can simplify the expression for the cost of gardening:
  Cost = 10(L+2)(B+2)
       = 10[(170-B)+2][(B)+2]
       = 10(172B - B^2 + 4B + 8)
       = 10(-B^2 + 176B + 80)
       = -10(B^2 - 176B - 80)
  We can complete the square to find the minimum value of this expression, but we don't need to do that to answer the question.
  We can see that the cost will be a positive value, so we can eliminate choices D and E.
  We can also see that the cost will be greater than 3400, so we can eliminate choice A.
  We are left with choice B: 1700.

Question: Joe's age, Joe's sister's age and Joe’s fathers age sums up to 100. When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Find the age of Joe's father?
Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 48
  C: 50
  D: 55
  E: 58
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the equations, we get:
  F - J - 3S = 0  (Equation 1)
  F - J - 2F + 2S = 0  (Equation 2)
  Rearranging Equation 1, we get:
  F = J + 3S
  Substituting F in Equation 2, we get:
  J + 3S - J - 2(3S) = 0
  J - 3S = 0
  J = 3S
  Substituting J in Equation 1, we get:
  F = 10S
  Substituting F in the first equation, we get:
  3S + S + 10S = 100
  14S = 100
  S = 7.14 (approx)
  F = 10S = 71.4 (approx)
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is approximately 71.4.

  F = 10S = 71.4 (approx)
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is approximately 71.4.
  The closest answer choice is E: 58.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the equations, we get:
  F - J - 3S = 0  (Equation 1)
  F - J - 2F + 2S = 0  (Equation 2)
  Rearranging Equation 1, we get:
  F = J + 3S
  Substituting F in Equation 2, we get:
  J + 3S - J - 2(3S) = 0
  J - 3S = 0
  J = 3S
  Substituting J in Equation 1, we get:
  F = 10S
  Substituting F in the first equation, we get:
  3S + S + 10S = 100
  14S = 100
  S = 7.14 (approx)
  F = 10S = 71.4 (approx)

  E: None of the above
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the distance between A and B is "d" miles.
  Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time he took to travel from A to B is d/70.
  Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time he took to travel from B to A is d/90.
  Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled (d-70) miles from A to B, and (d-70) miles from B to A, and he had 3 more hours to travel.

Question: I know a 5 digit number having a property that with a 1 after it, it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
What is that number?
Choices:
  A: 42857
  B: 32456
  C: 76523
  D: 24567
  E: 43566
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
  According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
  Multiplying 3 to "1abcde" gives us 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e.
  And, "abcde1" is 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 69999a = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  Since a is a digit, the right-hand side of the equation must be divisible by 69999.
  The only digit that makes the right-hand side divisible by 69999 is 3.
  Therefore, a = 3.
  Substituting a = 3 in the equation, we get 209997 = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  The largest value for b that satisfies the equation is 9.
  Substituting b = 9 in the equation, we get 179970 = 297c + 27d + 2e.
  The largest value for c that satisfies the equation is 6.
  Substituting c = 6 in the equation, we get 178272 = 27d + 2e.
  The largest value for d that satisfies the equation is 5.
  Substituting d = 5 in the equation, we get 178162 = 2e.
  The largest value for e that satisfies the equation is 1.
  Therefore, the number is 32951.

  And, "abcde1" is 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 69999a = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  Since a is a digit, the right-hand side of the equation must be divisible by 69999.
  The only digit that makes the right-hand side divisible by 69999 is 3.
  Therefore, a = 3.
  Substituting a = 3 in the equation, we get 209997 = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  The largest value for b that satisfies the equation is 9.
  Substituting b = 9 in the equation, we get 179970 = 297c + 27d + 2e.
  The largest value for c that satisfies the equation is 6.
  Substituting c = 6 in the equation, we get 178272 = 27d + 2e.

  n*(x+60) = 6,24,000
  n*(6,00,000/n + 60) = 6,24,000
  6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000
  60n = 24,000
  n = 400
  Therefore, there are 400 employees in that organization.
  The answer is C: 400.

Response 9:
Thought:
  Let's assume there are 'n' employees in the organization.
  Each employee contributes 'x' amount of money.
  Therefore, the total amount collected is n*x.
  According to the problem, n*x = 6,00,000 and n*(x+60) = 6,24,000.
  We can solve these two equations to find the value of 'n'.
  n*x = 6,00,000 => x = 6,00,000/n
  n*(x+60) = 6,24,000
  n*(6,00,000/n + 60) = 6,24,000
  6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000
  60n = 24,000
  n = 400
  Therefore, there are 400 employees in that organization.

Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Thought:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
The total number of people receiving the money is 5+4+2 = 11.
The total amount of money is Rs 8600.
We can set up an equation to solve for x:
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying the equation, we get:
35x = 8600
x = 8600/35
x = 246.29 (approx)
Each daughter receives 4x = 4*246.29 = 985.16 (approx)
Therefore, each daughter receives approximately Rs 985. Answer("None of the above")

  The total cost of the trip is $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25).
  We want to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50, which means we need to solve the equation:
  $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25) = $8.50
  $0.40(x - 0.25) = $5.00
  x - 0.25 = 12.5
  x = 12.75
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

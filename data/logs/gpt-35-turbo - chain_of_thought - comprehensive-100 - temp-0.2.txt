Question: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
Choices:
  A: 2.6m
  B: 3.9m
  C: 4m
  D: 4.2m
  E: 4.4m
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then the length of the room is 5x - 4x = x.
  The area of the four walls is 2x * (x + 5x) = 12x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is 12x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of the paper required is (12x^2 - 15) * 2 / 100.
  So, (12x^2 - 15) * 2 / 100 = 260 / 2 = 130.
  Solving this equation, we get x = 2.6.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5.2m.
  The answer is not in the choices, so the closest answer is D: 4.2m.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is 2x(5x/2 - 2x) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The total area to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost is Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m is Rs.2/0.5 = Rs.4.
  Then, (9x^2 - 15) x 4 = 260.
  Solving the equation, we get x = 2.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 4m.
  The answer is C: 4m.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the cost of the paper used.
  The cost of the paper used is equal to the area of the walls multiplied by the cost per meter.
  The area of the walls is equal to the height of the room multiplied by the semi-perimeter multiplied by the width of the paper.
  We need to subtract the area of the doors and windows from the total area of the walls.
  We can then solve for x and find the height of the room.
  After solving, we get x = 2.6.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5.2m.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, so we can set up the equation 2(50/100)(9x^2 - 15) = 260.
  Simplifying this equation gives 9x^2 - 15 = 260/2 = 130.
  Solving for x gives x = 5.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 10 meters.
  The answer is not in the choices, so the most likely answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x and the breadth of the room is y.
  The area of the four walls of the room is (2x)(5y - 2x) = 10xy - 4x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is the area of the paper required.
  The area of the paper required is (10xy - 4x^2 - 15) sq.m.
  The length of the paper required is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room.
  The perimeter of the room is 2(5y - 2x) + 2y = 10y - 4x + 2y = 12y - 4x.
  The length of the paper required is (12y - 4x)(2x) = 24xy - 8x^2.
  The cost of the paper is Rs.260.
  The cost of the paper required is (24xy - 8x^2)(2)/100 = (48xy - 16x^2)/100.
  Therefore, we have the equation (48xy - 16x^2)/100 = 260.
  Solving for y/x, we get y/x = 13/2.
  Substituting this value in the ratio 2:5, we get x = 2.6.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5.2m.
  The answer is not in the choices. 
  The closest answer is B: 3.9m.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after subtracting the area of doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 1m is Rs.8.
  So, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 1m is Rs.8 = (2)(4).
  The height of the room can be found by equating the two expressions for the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall.
  Solving for x, we get x = 0.6.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 1.2m.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x.
  The area of the four walls is 2x(5y - 2x).
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is 2x(5y - 2x) - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50 cm = 0.5 m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.2/2 = Rs.1.
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the area of the walls to be papered times the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall.
  Therefore, we can write the equation: (2x(5y - 2x) - 15) x 1 = 260.
  Simplifying the equation, we get: 20x^2 - 50xy + 145 = 0.
  Solving for x, we get: x = 2.6.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 5.2.
  The answer is A: 2.6m.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the four walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering one square meter is Rs.2/2 = Rs.1.
  Therefore, the area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is 260/1 = 260 sq.m.
  So, 9x^2 - 15 = 260.
  Solving for x, we get x = 5.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 10.
Action: Answer("None of the above") 
The correct answer is not among the choices given. The height of the room is 10 meters.
Response 8:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  The perimeter of the room is 2 x semi-perimeter = 10x.
  The width of the room is (10x - 2x)/2 = 4x.
  The area of the room is 2x * 4x = 8x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, the area of the walls is 8x^2 - 15.
  The length of the walls is the perimeter of the room times the height, which is 10x * 2x = 20x^2.
  The cost of papering the walls is the length of the walls times the cost of the paper per meter, which is 20x^2 * 2 = 40x^2.
  We know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  Therefore, 40x^2 = 260, which gives x^2 = 6.5.
  Hence, x = sqrt(6.5).
  The height of the room is 2x = 2 * sqrt(6.5).
  The answer is approximately 4.04m, which is closest to 4m.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x * 9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is (9x^2 - 15).
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is (260/(9x^2 - 15)).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with a 50cm wide paper is Rs.4.
  So, (260/(9x^2 - 15)) = 4.
  Solving this equation, we get x = 2.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 4m.
  The answer is C: 4m.

  D: 487
  E: 286
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 'x' number of each type of coin.
  The total value of 25 paise coins = 0.25 * 0.01 * x = 0.0025x
  The total value of 50 paise coins = 0.50 * 0.01 * x = 0.005x
  The total value of one rupee coins = 1 * x = 1x
  The total value of all coins = 0.0025x + 0.005x + 1x = 1.0075x
  The total value of all coins = Rs. 700
  Therefore, 1.0075x = 700
  Solving for x, we get x = 694.73
  But we know that the number of coins must be a whole number, so we round down to the nearest whole number.
  Therefore, the number of each type of coin is 694.
  The answer is None of the Above.
  We can also verify the answer by checking if the total value of all coins is equal to Rs. 700.
  Total value of 25 paise coins = 694 * 0.25 * 0.01 = Rs. 17.35
  Total value of 50 paise coins = 694 * 0.50 * 0.01 = Rs. 34.70
  Total value of one rupee coins = 694 * 1 = Rs. 694
  Total value of all coins = Rs. 17.35 + Rs. 34.70 + Rs. 694 = Rs. 700.05
  The total value of all coins is approximately equal to Rs. 700.

  The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for the middle letter.
  The first and third letters must be different from each other and are both consonants, so there are 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter.
  The order of the first and third letters matter, so we need to use the permutation formula.
  The number of ways to choose the first and third letters is P(20,2) = 20!/(20-2)! = 20*19 = 380.
  The total number of codes is the product of the number of choices for each letter.
  Therefore, the total number of codes is 5*380 = 1900.

Topic: Math
Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500
Response 0:
Thought:
  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from the previous year is 20.
  The percentage of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from the previous year is (20/500) * 100 = 4%.
  If the percentage of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then the number of deer in the forest with tags is (4/100) * total deer population.
  The number of deer in the forest with tags is equal to the number of deer tagged in 2001 plus the number of deer with tags from the previous year that were not caught in 2002.
  Therefore, (4/100) * total deer population = 300 + (300 - 20) = 580.
  Solving for total deer population gives total deer population = 580 * 100 / 4 = 14500.
  The answer is E: 7500.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year.
  Therefore, the number of deer tagged in 2002 is 20.
  The percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.
  Therefore, the ratio of tagged deer in 2002 to the total deer population in the forest is equal to the ratio of the number of tagged deer in the 500 deer sample to the total number of deer in the 500 deer sample.
  Let x be the total deer population in the forest.
  Then, (20/x) = (20/500) = 0.04
  Therefore, x = 5000.
  The total deer population in the forest is 5000.
  The answer is C: 5000.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from 2001 is 20.
  The percentage of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from 2001 is (20/500) * 100 = 4%.
  If 4% of the total deer population has tags, then the total deer population is (100/4) * 300 = 7500.
  Therefore, the answer is E: 7500.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The number of deer caught and tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500, and only 20 of them had tags from the previous year.
  Therefore, the number of deer caught in 2002 that were not tagged in 2001 is 500 - 20 = 480.
  The total number of tagged deer in the forest is 300.
  If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then we can set up the following equation:
  (number of tagged deer in 2002) / (total deer population) = (number of tagged deer caught in 2002) / (total number of deer caught in 2002)
  We know that the number of tagged deer caught in 2002 is 20, and the total number of deer caught in 2002 is 500. We can solve for the total deer population:
  (300) / (total deer population) = (20) / (500)
  Cross-multiplying, we get:
  20 * total deer population = 300 * 500
  total deer population = (300 * 500) / 20
  total deer population = 7500
  Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the total deer population in the forest is "x".
  In 2001, 300 deer were tagged and released. Therefore, the number of deer with tags in the forest is 300.
  In 2002, 500 deer were caught, and only 20 of them had tags from the previous year. Therefore, the number of deer with tags in the forest is 300 + 20 = 320.
  We are given that the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.
  Therefore, (320/x) * 100 = (500/x) * 20
  Solving for x, we get x = 7500.
  Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.
  The answer is E: 7500.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from the previous year is 20.
  The percentage of deer caught in 2002 that had tags from the previous year is (20/500)*100 = 4%.
  If the percentage of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then the percentage of the total deer population in the forest with tags is also 4%.
  Let the total deer population in the forest be x.
  Then, the number of deer with tags in the forest is 4% of x = (4/100)*x = 0.04x.
  We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the number of deer with tags in 2002 is 300.
  Therefore, the total number of deer in the forest is x = (300/0.04) = 7500.
  The answer is E: 7500.

  If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then the proportion of tagged deer in the forest is 20/500 = 0.04.
  Let x be the total deer population in the forest.
  Then, the proportion of tagged deer in the forest is also (300/x).
  We can set up an equation to solve for x:
  0.04 = 300/x
  x = 300/0.04 = 7500

Topic: Math
Question: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?
a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2
Choices:
  A: (a + b)(a - b)
  B: (a - b)2
  C: (a + b)2
  D: a3 + b3
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation.
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = a2 - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2)
  We can then simplify the expression by multiplying both sides by (a + b)2.
  (a + b)2(a2 - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2)) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  (a + b)2a2 - (a + b)2b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  a2(a + b)2 - b2(a + b)2 = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  (a + b)2(a2 - b2) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  We can then cancel out (a + b)2 from both sides.
  a2 - b2 = (a - b)2
  a2 - b2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  -b2 = -2ab + b2
  2b2 = 2ab
  b = a
  Therefore, the answer is (a + b)(a - b), which simplifies to (a + a)(a - a) = a2 - a2 = 0.
  The answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b) to simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
  a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  Therefore, a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2
  Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  Therefore, the equation becomes (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  Simplifying further, we get (a - b)/(a + b) = a2 - 2ab + b2/(a + b)2
  Multiplying both sides by (a + b)2, we get (a - b)(a + b) = (a + b)2(a2 - 2ab + b2/(a + b)2)
  Simplifying further, we get (a - b)(a + b) = (a + b)(a - b)2
  Therefore, the missing value is (a - b).
  The answer is B: (a - b)2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/(a + b)2 = [(a + b)(a - b)]/(a + b)2
  We can simplify the expression [(a + b)(a - b)]/(a + b)2 as follows:
  [(a + b)(a - b)]/(a + b)2 = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we have (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2
  So, the answer is (a - b)2
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation using the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b).
  a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  Therefore, a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2
  Simplifying the fraction on the right-hand side, we get (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, the equation becomes (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2
  Multiplying both sides by (a + b), we get (a - b) = (a - b)2(a + b)
  Dividing both sides by (a - b), we get 1 = (a + b)(a - b)
  Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = [(a + b)(a - b)]/[(a + b)(a + b)] = (a - b)2
  Therefore, the answer is (a - b)2
  The answer is B: (a - b)2
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can also use the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b))
  = [(a + b)(a - b)]/[(a + b)(a + b)]
  = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find the option that is equal to (a - b)/(a + b)
  We can see that option A is equal to (a2 - b2)/(a + b), which is close but not equal to (a - b)/(a + b)
  Option B is equal to (a - b)2/(a + b)2, which is equal to (a - b)/(a + b) * (a - b)/(a + b)
  Option C is equal to (a + b)2/(a + b)2, which is equal to 1
  Option D is not equal to (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, the answer is B: (a - b)2
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  We can then substitute this identity in the given equation.
  The equation becomes [(a + b)(a - b)] / [(a + b)2] = (a - b)2
  Simplifying the equation, we get (a - b) / (a + b) = a - b
  Multiplying both sides by (a + b), we get (a - b) = (a - b)(a + b)
  We can then divide both sides by (a - b) to get (a + b)
  Therefore, the answer is (a + b) or (a + b)2
  The correct choice is C: (a + b)2
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b) to simplify the left-hand side of the equation.
  a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  Therefore, a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2
  Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
  (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  (a + b)(a - b) = a2 - b2
  (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/(a + b)2 = 1 - 2ab/(a + b)2 + b2/(a + b)2
  Therefore, we have:
  1 - 2ab/(a + b)2 + b2/(a + b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  Rearranging the terms, we get:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  Comparing this with the given equation, we can see that the missing term is (a + b)2.
  Therefore, the answer is C: (a + b)2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation.
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = a2 - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2)
  We can then simplify the expression by multiplying both sides by (a + b)2.
  (a + b)2(a2 - b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2)) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  (a + b)2a2 - (a + b)2b2/(a2 + 2ab + b2) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  a2(a + b)2 - b2(a + b)2 = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  (a + b)2(a2 - b2) = (a + b)2(a - b)2
  We can then cancel out (a + b)2 from both sides.
  a2 - b2 = (a - b)2
  a2 - b2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  -b2 = -2ab + b2
  2b2 = 2ab
  b = a
  Therefore, the answer is (a + b)(a - b), which simplifies to (a + a)(a - a) = a2 - a2 = 0.
  The answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the identity a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b).
  We can rewrite the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/(a + b)2 = [(a + b)(a - b)]/(a + b)2
  We can cancel out (a + b) from the numerator and denominator.
  We get (a - b) / (a + b) = (a - b)2 / (a + b)2

Question: If 75 percent of the employees of a certain company take a winter vacation, 40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, and 20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation?
Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  We know that the total number of employees is 100.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take a winter vacation only is 75 - 40 = 35.
  The number of employees who take a summer vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  We can use this information to find Q.
  Q is the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  This means that Q is equal to the number of employees who take a summer vacation minus the number of employees who take both vacations.
  Therefore, Q = 80 - 40 = 40.
  So, 40% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  The answer is not one of the available choices, but the most likely answer is D: 35%.

  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's assume that Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  We know that 40 employees take both vacations, so the number of employees who take only a winter vacation is 75 - 40 = 35.
  We also know that 20 employees take neither vacation, so the number of employees who take at least one vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take only a summer vacation is 80 - 35 - 40 = 5.
  So, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 5/100 = 5%.
  The answer is A: 5%.

  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees.
  Therefore, 100 - 75 - 20 = 5 employees take only a summer vacation or both a summer and winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take both a summer and winter vacation, which is 40 employees.
  Therefore, 40 - 5 = 35 employees take only a winter vacation.
  The total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 40 + 5 = 45 employees.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  From the given information, we know that the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
  Therefore, the total amount earned by the diver can be represented as 20x + 25y cents.
  We also know that the total amount earned by the diver after one dive is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  So, we can write the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve the equation for x in terms of y.
  20x + 25y = 340
  4x + 5y = 68
  4x = 68 - 5y
  x = (68 - 5y)/4
  Since x has to be a whole number, y has to be a multiple of 4.
  Let's try different values of y to see which one gives a whole number for x.
  If y = 4, then x = (68 - 5*4)/4 = 13, which is a whole number.
  If y = 8, then x = (68 - 5*8)/4 = 10, which is a whole number.
  If y = 12, then x = (68 - 5*12)/4 = 7, which is not a whole number.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 13.
  Answer: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve for x in terms of y: 20x = 340 - 25y => x = (340 - 25y)/20
  We know that x has to be a positive integer, so we can try different values of y until we find a value that makes x a positive integer.
  If we try y = 0, we get x = 17, which is a positive integer.
  If we try y = 1, we get x = 14.75, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 2, we get x = 12.5, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 3, we get x = 10.25, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 4, we get x = 8, which is a positive integer.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 8.
  The answer is not in the choices.
Response 2:
Thought:
  Let's assume the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for 'c' copper coins is 20c cents.
  Similarly, the amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for 'b' brass coins is 25b cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  Therefore, the equation for the total amount of money she got is 20c + 25b = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of 'c'.
  Let's try to solve the equation for 'c' in terms of 'b'.
  20c + 25b = 340
  20c = 340 - 25b
  c = (340 - 25b) / 20
  We know that the number of coins cannot be a fraction or a negative number.
  Let's try to find the values of 'b' that give us a whole number for 'c'.
  If we substitute b = 0, we get c = 17, which is a whole number.
  If we substitute b = 1, we get c = 16.75, which is not a whole number.
  If we substitute b = 2, we get c = 16.5, which is not a whole number.
  If we substitute b = 3, we get c = 16.25, which is not a whole number.
  If we substitute b = 4, we get c = 16, which is a whole number.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 16.

Response 3:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  According to the problem, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
  Therefore, the total amount of money the diver gets can be expressed as 20x + 25y cents.
  We know that the total amount of money the diver got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  So, we can write the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try different values of x and see which one gives us a valid solution for y.
  If x = 1, then 20 + 25y = 340, which means y = 12.
  If x = 2, then 40 + 25y = 340, which means y = 12.
  If x = 3, then 60 + 25y = 340, which means y = 10.
  If x = 4, then 80 + 25y = 340, which means y = 10.
  If x = 5, then 100 + 25y = 340, which means y = 8.
  If x = 6, then 120 + 25y = 340, which means y = 8.
  If x = 7, then 140 + 25y = 340, which means y = 6.
  If x = 8, then 160 + 25y = 340, which means y = 6.
  If x = 9, then 180 + 25y = 340, which means y = 4.
  If x = 10, then 200 + 25y = 340, which means y = 4.
  If x > 10, then the value of y will be negative, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 3.
  The answer is B: 3.

  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340 cents.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  Let's start by assuming that she brought 0 copper coins.
  In this case, the equation becomes: 25y = 340 cents.
  This equation has no integer solution for y.
  Let's assume that she brought 1 copper coin.
  In this case, the equation becomes: 20 + 25y = 340 cents.
  This equation has an integer solution for y: y = 12.

Thought:
Let's assume that the initial price of the product is 100.
If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price is 70.
To make the new price 100, we need to increase it by 30/70 = 0.4286 or 42.86%.
Therefore, the answer is B: 42.86%.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
Let's assume the initial price of the product is 100.
If the price is reduced by 30%, then the new price is 70.
To increase the price to 100, we need to increase it by (100-70)/70 = 30/70 = 3/7 = 0.4286 or 42.86%.
Therefore, the answer is B: 42.86%.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
Let P be the original price of the product.
After a 30% reduction, the new price of the product is 0.7P.
To increase the price to 100%, we need to multiply the new price by (1/0.7).
The calculation is (1/0.7) x 0.7P = P.
Simplifying the equation, we get (1/0.7) = 1.4286.
Therefore, the price needs to be increased by 42.86% to make it 100%.

Let's assume the original price of the product is $100.
After reducing the price by 30%, the new price becomes $70.
To make it 100% again, we need to increase the price by $30.
The percentage increase can be calculated as (increase/original price) * 100.
So, (30/70) * 100 = 42.86%
Therefore, the answer is B: 42.86%

  D: 15
  E: 12
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original length of the ribbon was 30 cm.
  The ratio of the reduction is 5:3.
  This means that the length of the ribbon was reduced to 5/8 of its original length.
  To find the length of the ribbon now, we need to multiply the original length by 5/8.
  30 x 5/8 = 18.75
  The length of the ribbon now is 18.75 cm.
  However, this is not one of the answer choices.
  The closest answer choice is A: 18.

Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.
Response 0:

Context: A theater plans to perform 7 repertoires in the 7 weeks of the fall, they are F, G., J, K, O, R, S.One repertoire is performed every week, and each repertoire is exactly one week.The repertoire must meet the following conditions? (1) G must be performed in the third week.(2) O and S cannot perform continuously.(3) K must be arranged before J and S.(4) F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
Question: If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then which week must R be scheduled?
Choices:
  A: the second week
  B: Fourth week
  C: fifth week
  D: Seventh week
Response 0:
Thought: 
  S is scheduled for the sixth week.
  According to condition (2), O and S cannot perform continuously.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the fifth week.
  According to condition (3), K must be arranged before J and S.
  Therefore, K must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  According to condition (1), G must be performed in the third week.
  Therefore, G cannot be scheduled for the fourth week.
  According to condition (4), F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  Therefore, F and J must be scheduled for the second and third weeks, but not necessarily in that order.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  The answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we can use the given conditions to determine the possible schedules for the other repertoires.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (2), we know that O and S cannot perform continuously, so O must be performed in either the fourth or fifth week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S, so K must be performed in either the first or second week.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, so F must be performed in either the second or third week.
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then the only possible schedules for the other repertoires are:
  Week 1: K
  Week 2: F
  Week 3: G
  Week 4: O
  Week 5: J
  Week 6: S
  Week 7: R
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  The answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we can use the given conditions to determine where R must be scheduled.
  From condition (2), we know that O and S cannot perform continuously, so O must be scheduled either before or after S.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S. Since S is scheduled for the sixth week, K must be scheduled in one of the first five weeks.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks. Since K must be scheduled before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, F and J must be scheduled in the first four weeks.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week. Therefore, the possible schedules for the first four weeks are:
  Week 1: K
  Week 2: F
  Week 3: G
  Week 4: J
  or
  Week 1: F
  Week 2: K
  Week 3: G
  Week 4: J
  In either case, R must be scheduled in the fifth week.
  Therefore, the answer is C: fifth week.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the fifth week because O and S cannot perform continuously.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  Since F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K is scheduled for the fourth week, then F and J must be scheduled for the fifth and sixth weeks.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the second week because G must be performed in the third week.
  The answer is A: the second week.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, K cannot be scheduled for the seventh week either.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  The answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the first week or the second week.
  If O is scheduled for the first week, then F and J must be scheduled for the second and third weeks, respectively.
  Then, K must be scheduled for the fourth week, and R must be scheduled for the fifth week.
  However, this violates the condition that K must be arranged before J and S.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the second week.
  Then, F and J must be scheduled for the fifth and sixth weeks, respectively.
  K must be scheduled for the fourth week, and R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since there are only seven weeks, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth, or fifth week.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  If O is scheduled for the first week, then K must be scheduled for the second week, and J must be scheduled for the third week. However, this violates condition (1) since G must be performed in the third week.
  If O is scheduled for the second week, then K must be scheduled for the first week, and J must be scheduled for the third week. This satisfies all conditions, and we know that G must be scheduled for the third week. Therefore, F must be scheduled for the fourth week, and R must be scheduled for the fifth week.
  The answer is C: fifth week.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the fifth week because O and S cannot perform continuously.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  Since F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K is scheduled for the fourth week, then F and J must be scheduled for the fifth and sixth weeks.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the second week because G must be performed in the third week.
  The answer is A: the second week.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for the fourth or fifth week.
  If F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K must be scheduled before J and S, then F and J must be scheduled for the first and second weeks or the second and third weeks.
  Since G must be performed in the third week, then R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since there are only 7 weeks, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth or fifth week.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  If F and J are scheduled for the first two weeks, then K must be scheduled for the third week, which means that G cannot be scheduled for the third week. This contradicts condition (1).
  Therefore, F and J must be scheduled for the second and third weeks, in some order.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be scheduled before J and S. Since S is scheduled for the sixth week, K must be scheduled for the fourth or fifth week.
  If K is scheduled for the fifth week, then O must be scheduled for the first week and R must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  If K is scheduled for the fourth week, then O must be scheduled for the fifth week and R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, if S is scheduled for the sixth week, then R must be scheduled for the fourth week.

When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: 
  1. unknown
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. unknown
  6. unknown
  7. unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment could be:
  1. Quinn
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. unknown
  7. unknown
  From the given information, we also know that Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order of recruitment could be:
  1. Quinn
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Villas
  7. White
  From the given information, we know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, the order of recruitment could not be:
  1. Quinn
  2. Tao
  3. Stanton
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Villas
  7. White
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Quinn was recruited third. 
  The answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the recruits is: [1, Tao, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the recruits is: [1, Tao, 3, Peters, 5, 6, 7]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of the recruits is: [1, Tao, Quinn, Peters, 5, Rovero, 7]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the recruits is: [1, Tao, Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero]
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [Peters] [5] [6] [7]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be recruited sixth because Peters was recruited third.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [Peters] [Rovero] [White] [7]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1- [unknown]
  2- Tao
  3- [unknown]
  4- [unknown]
  5- [unknown]
  6- [unknown]
  7- [unknown]
  
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1- [unknown]
  2- Tao
  3- [unknown]
  4- Peters
  5- [unknown]
  6- [unknown]
  7- [unknown]
  
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third, because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first or second.
  
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so if White was recruited third, then Villas was recruited second, and Tao was recruited first. Therefore, White cannot be recruited third.
  
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1- [unknown]
  2- Tao
  3- Quinn
  4- Peters
  5- Rovero
  6- [unknown]
  7- [unknown]
  
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1- [unknown]
  2- Tao
  3- Quinn
  4- Peters
  5- Rovero
  6- Villas
  7- White
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao was recruited either first, second, third, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited before Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited either first, second, or third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited either third, fourth, or fifth.
  If Villas was recruited third, then White was recruited fourth, and Rovero was recruited fifth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Quinn was recruited third, and Rovero was recruited fifth, which contradicts the fact that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited sixth.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then White was recruited seventh, and Rovero was recruited fifth, which contradicts the fact that Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, Villas was not recruited sixth.
  If White was recruited third, then Villas was recruited second, which contradicts the fact that Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, White was not recruited third.
  The only option left is that Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, and then five others.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited either third or fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White was recruited last.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Quinn was recruited fourth, and Rovero was recruited fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited fourth, then Quinn was recruited third, and Rovero was recruited fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then Quinn was recruited fourth, and Rovero was recruited sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Quinn was recruited fifth, and Rovero was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the only possible option is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, and five others.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be either the first or the last of the five others.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be either the second or the third of the five others.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be either the fourth or the fifth of the five others.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters cannot be the first or the second of the five others.
  Therefore, Peters must be the third of the five others, and the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, and two others.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, Rovero, White, and Stanton, which violates the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero, which violates the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, and two others, which violates the condition that there are seven accomplices.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, White, Villas, Quinn, Stanton, and Rovero, which satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton
  2. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, Stanton, White
  3. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, White, Villas, Stanton
  4. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, White, Rovero, Villas, Stanton
  From the above orders, we can see that the only option that could be true is that Quinn was recruited third.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, and five others.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited before Peters and Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited after Peters and Tao.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, one other, Rovero, Villas, and White. This order does not satisfy the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, one other, Villas, Stanton, and White. This order satisfies all the conditions.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, one other, Villas, White, and Stanton. This order does not satisfy the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, White, two others, Villas, one other, and Stanton or Rovero. This order does not satisfy the condition that Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the only possible order is Peters, Tao, Quinn, one other, Villas, Stanton, and White.
  This means that Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Quinn cannot be recruited third. If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then White must be recruited seventh. Therefore, Villas cannot be recruited sixth. If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth. If Tao was recruited second and Peters was recruited fourth, then Rovero must be recruited fifth. Therefore, the answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  If O is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and either F or L.
  If O is performed fifth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F, and the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  Therefore, the possible lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - O, P, F
  - O, P, L
  - F, H, L
  - L, H, F
  The only option that matches one of these possible lists is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the first three compositions must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so we can eliminate choices C and D.
  P is performed at some time before S, so we can eliminate choice E.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, so we can eliminate choice A.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H, P, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if O is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  If O is performed fifth, then the order of the first three compositions must be F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  P is performed at some time before S, so P cannot be performed fourth.
  Therefore, the possible options for the first three compositions are O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  The answer is either C: O, P, R or D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed after S and before O or after O and before S must be performed in the first three compositions.
  From the given options, only option D has O and P in the first two compositions.
  Also, T can be performed immediately after P.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be P, R, and T or P, R, and L.
  P is performed at some time before S, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be R, S, and T.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be O, P, and T.
  Therefore, the only possible order of the first three compositions is L, H, and F.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth. Therefore, the fifth composition must be S.
  P is performed at some time before S. Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, the composition that is not performed eighth must be performed sixth or seventh.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed eighth, and if T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed eighth.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, if F is performed first, then the compositions that are performed second and third must be H and L in some order, and if R is performed eighth, then the compositions that are performed sixth and seventh must be H and L in some order.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, if O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and if O is performed fifth, then P must be performed third.
  The possible orders of the first three compositions are:
    1. F, H, L
      - If F is performed first, then H and L must be performed second and third in some order.
      - If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed eighth.
      - If O is performed first, then P must be performed second.
      - If S is performed fifth, then the order of the last three compositions must be T, R, and either L or H.
      - Therefore, the possible order of the last three compositions is T, R, and L.
      - Therefore, the possible order of all eight compositions is O, P, F, H, L, T, R, and S.
    2. L, H, F
      - If L is performed first, then H and F must be performed second and third in some order.
      - If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed eighth.
      - If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed third.
      - If S is performed fifth, then the order of the last three compositions must be T, R, and either L or H.
      - Therefore, the possible order of the last three compositions is T, R, and H.
      - Therefore, the possible order of all eight compositions is L, H, F, P, S, T, R, and H.
  Therefore, the possible accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is either:
    - O, P, F (Choice A)
    - L, P, H (None of the above)
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed at some time before S.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third. But this violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth, and S must be performed sixth or seventh.
  If F is performed before R, then T must be performed immediately after R, and P must be performed before S. This means that the order of the first three compositions must be F, H, and P.
  If R is performed before F, then T must be performed immediately before F, and P must be performed before S. This means that the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and T.
  Therefore, the possible accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, are either F, H, and P or O, P, and T.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then O must be performed first.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then the compositions performed after O and before S must be F, H, and P in some order.
  If O is performed fifth, then the compositions performed after S and before O must be F, H, and P in some order.
  In both cases, P is performed before S.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies the given conditions is A: F, H, P.

  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  O is performed either first or fifth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  From the given choices, only option D satisfies all the given conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  If P is performed first, then R must be performed second, and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed second, then R must be performed first, and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed third, then R must be performed first, and T must be performed second.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third.
  If O is performed fifth, then F must be performed first, and H must be performed second.
  Therefore, the possible accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first: R, T, F
  - If P is performed second: R, P, T
  - If P is performed third: R, P, T
  - If O is performed first: O, P, R

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, regardless of the trades made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building in return.
  If RealProp trades the Yates House or the Zimmer House, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it must receive two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building in return.
  If Trustcorp trades any of its buildings, it must receive a building or buildings of the same class in return.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because Southco can trade the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building for the Lynch Building.)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because Southco does not own any of these buildings.)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. (Possible because Trustcorp can trade the King Building and the Ortiz Building for the Flores Tower and the Yates House.)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (Impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.) 
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House is class 3, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the Yates House must be traded for one building of the same class.
  The Garza Tower is class 1, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one building of the same class.
  Therefore, the Garza Tower must be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is class 1, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one building of the same class.
  Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for one building of the same class.
  The Lynch Building is class 2, so it can only be traded for two class 3 buildings or one building of the same class.
  Therefore, the Lynch Building must be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they involve buildings that are not owned by the respective companies.
  Option D is possible because Trustcorp can own the Yates House after a trade.
  Option E is not possible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  The Flores Tower is a class 1 building owned by Southco.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  No trade can change the class of a building.
  Therefore, the class of the buildings owned by each company will remain the same.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This can be true because Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This can be true because Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower and Southco owns the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know the initial buildings owned by each company.
  We know the three types of trades that can be made.
  We need to determine which statement cannot be true, no matter how many trades are made.
  Statement A: RealProp owns only class 1 and class 3 buildings, so this statement cannot be true.
  Statement B: Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings, so this statement cannot be true.
  Statement C: Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so this statement cannot be true.
  Statement D: Trustcorp does not own the Yates House, so this statement cannot be true.
  Statement E: Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower, and Southco does not own the Lynch Building, so this statement cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, then RealProp will have two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building.
  If RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for two class 2 buildings, then RealProp will have one class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  If RealProp trades the Zimmer House (class 3) for two class 3 buildings, then RealProp will have one class 1 building, one class 2 building, and one class 3 building.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, then Southco will have one class 2 building and one class 3 building.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, then Southco will have one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will have two class 3 buildings and one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will have two class 3 buildings and one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will have two class 3 buildings and one class 2 building.
  Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know which buildings are owned by each company and their respective classes.
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, regardless of how many trades are made.
  Statement A is impossible because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  Statement B is impossible because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  Statement C is impossible because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  Statement D is possible because Trustcorp can own the Flores Tower and the Yates House if they trade for them.
  Statement E is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House is class 3, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp cannot trade the Yates House for two Trustcorp buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp cannot own the Yates House.
  Therefore, D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, then RealProp will not have any class 1 building.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings, then Southco will not have any class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will not have any class 2 building.
  Therefore, the building owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building, because they are all class 2 buildings.
  Also, the building owned by Southco cannot be the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building, because they are both class 2 buildings.
  The building owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Flores Tower or the Yates House, because they are both class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If RealProp trades a class 3 building, it must receive a class 3 building in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  A: RealProp cannot own the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because these buildings are owned by Trustcorp.
  B: This statement is possible.
  C: Southco cannot own the King Building because this building is owned by Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower and the Yates House because these buildings are owned by RealProp and Southco, respectively.
  E: Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building because these buildings are owned by RealProp and Southco, respectively.
  Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1.
  Therefore, there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.
  Therefore, either Tiao or Udall is in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 1, then Tiao is in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or Udall.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1. But either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. But if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Parra must be in Zone 3. This means that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Tiao cannot be in Zone 2. Similarly, Udall cannot be in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3. This means that there are three sales representatives in Zone 3, which is more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can only be in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then there are already two sales representatives in Zone 3 (Stuckey and Udall). Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Tiao must be in Zone 1 and Zone 2. 
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall would be left to work in Zone 2 and Zone 3. This would mean that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall would also have to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  This means that Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 1 as well.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Stuckey must work in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.

  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1 or Zone 2, then the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone would be the one who works in the same zone as Parra or Tiao, or Tiao or Udall, respectively.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone would be the one who works in the same zone as Stuckey or Udall.

  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall would be in Zone 2 or 3. This would mean that Tiao would have to be in the same zone as Parra, which is not possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall would be in Zone 1 or 3. This would mean that Parra would have to be in the same zone as Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or Udall. However, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so this is not possible. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall would be in Zone 1 or 2. This would mean that either Parra or Tiao would have to be in the same zone as Kim, Mahr, or Quinn.

Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

  Let's check each option to see if it is a valid assignment.
  
Option A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  Frost and Heideck are assigned to the same ceremony, which is valid.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is not valid.
  Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, but we need to assign both Heideck and Mays to it if Knutson is not assigned, which is not valid.
  Therefore, option A is not a valid assignment.
  
Option B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  Frost and Heideck are assigned to the same ceremony, which is valid.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is not valid.

Option C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is not valid.
  Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, but we need to assign both Heideck and Mays to it if Knutson is not assigned, which is not valid.
  Therefore, option C is not a valid assignment.
  
Option D: Heideck, Lai
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost must be assigned to the same ceremony as Heideck.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is not valid.
  Therefore, option D is not a valid assignment.
  
Option E: Knutson, Mays
  Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, but we need to assign both Heideck and Mays to it if Knutson is not assigned, so Mays must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is valid.

  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option C because only two photographers are assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option D because neither Frost nor Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option E because Knutson is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A assigns four photographers to the Silva University ceremony, but we need to assign at least two photographers to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Option B assigns three photographers to the Silva University ceremony, which means we can assign the other three photographers to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?

  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on a wall other than wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  Therefore, the only option left is Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 3.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Isaacs's watercolor is displayed, which is wall 2.
  This means that Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls 1, 2, or 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then neither Isaacs's oil nor Franz's oil can be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the upper position of wall 3.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")

  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  However, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4 because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4 and no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then the other painting on wall 1 must be an oil painting.
  Also, no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, so the other painting on wall 1 must be painted by someone other than Isaacs and Franz.
  According to the condition "Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed", Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, the only painting left to be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's watercolor.

  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  From the above rules, we can infer that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the given choices, only option D satisfies all the above rules.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  #1: Robertson; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Souza; #5: Togowa; #6: Vaughn
  The answer is C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
  Option A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Option B violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Option C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one of Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn cannot both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2 if Udall is already working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  We also know that there are exactly seven sales representatives.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  From the given choices, only D and E include Tiao and Udall in Zone 3.
  However, in choice E, Parra and Quinn are also in Zone 3, which violates the condition that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they do not include Stuckey and Udall.
  We can eliminate choice D because it only includes Tiao and Udall in Zone 3, but we know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the person who is not working in Zone 1 between Parra and Tiao must be working in Zone 3.
  We can eliminate Kim, Mahr, and Quinn from the list since they are not mentioned to be working in Zone 3.
  We can eliminate Parra since we know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall works in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn must work in Zone 1 with Parra.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already assigned to Zone 3, Tiao must be assigned to Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra must be assigned to Zone 1.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must be assigned to Zone 1.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to be assigned to Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the sales representative who does not work in Zone 1 must work in Zone 3.
  We can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not include Stuckey and Udall.
  We can eliminate option D because it does not include Parra or Quinn.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one must be working in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is working in Zone 3, then Quinn must also be working in Zone 3.
  If Tiao is working in Zone 3, then Kim must be working in Zone 2.
  If Parra is working in Zone 2, then Quinn must also be working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the remaining sales representative (who is not in Zone 1) must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, but we don't know which one.
  We know that there are seven sales representatives in total, and we have accounted for four of them (Stuckey, Udall, and the two in Zone 3).
  Therefore, the remaining three sales representatives must be in Zone 2.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, and we know that Udall is already accounted for.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  We have now accounted for all seven sales representatives, and we know that the sales representatives working in Zone 3 are Stuckey, Udall, and the remaining sales representative who is not Parra or Tiao.
  The only choice that includes Stuckey, Udall, and one other sales representative who is not Parra or Tiao is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already assigned to Zone 3, Tiao must be assigned to Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra must be assigned to Zone 1.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must be assigned to Zone 1.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to be assigned to Zone 3.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know the exact number of books on each shelf, but we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  From the given options, the only one that satisfies the above conditions is option B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the same shelf, either the top or middle shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and M cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the top shelf.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, K must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, O must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least two books.
  The only answer choice that satisfies all of these conditions is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that each shelf has at least two books. Therefore, if the bottom shelf has three books, then the other two shelves must have two books each.
  Based on the above reasoning, the only possible list of books that could be placed on the bottom shelf is F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and E because they do not have any of the required books on the bottom shelf.
  We can eliminate choice D because it has too many books on the bottom shelf.
  We are left with choices A and B.
  If we choose A, then the remaining books (G, H, I, K, L, O) must be split between the top two shelves, which is not possible because I must be on the middle shelf and K must be on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that I cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can also conclude that O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that F and M must be placed on the same shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that K must be placed on a higher shelf than F and M.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that G, H, and L can be placed on any shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know where G, H, I, K, L, and O are placed.
  We can eliminate C, D, and E because they don't include F or M on the bottom shelf.
  We can eliminate A because it only includes two books on the bottom shelf, and we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf and K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Also, O is placed on a higher shelf than L and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, we can deduce that K, O, and L cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so at least three books must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the remaining books (F, G, H, I, M), we can see that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so they must be either both on the top or both on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible combination for the books on the bottom shelf is F, G, and M.
  The answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that F and M must be on the same shelf as I, which is the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the books on the bottom shelf must be H, K, L, O, and at least one more book.
  The only option that includes at least three of these books is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We can use the above two conditions to eliminate some of the choices.
  If F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot be on the bottom shelf because there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and D.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choice B.
  We are left with choices C and E.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only option left is choice C: G, H, K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know where G, H, I, K, L, and O are placed.
  From the given options, we need to find the one that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  Option A cannot be correct because it only has two books, and we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Option B cannot be correct because it has H, which we don't know where it is placed.
  Option C cannot be correct because it doesn't have any of the books that we know are placed on the bottom shelf.
  Option D could be correct because it has F, G, M, and O, and we know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Option E cannot be correct because it doesn't have any of the books that we know are placed on the bottom shelf.

Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same.

  The argument commits the error of assuming that the current market condition will remain the same in the future.
  Therefore, the answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.

Topic: Law
Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.

  The museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, we can conclude that:
  A: Every print in the museum store is not necessarily of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. This is because the museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. This is true because the museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. This is not necessarily true because the museum store may not have prints of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector. This is not true because the statement says that Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. This is not necessarily true because the statement does not say whether Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum or not.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find an option that shows that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D does not undermine the argument because the survey was conducted before the debate.
  Option E does not undermine the argument because the margin of victory is not relevant to the argument.
  None of the options undermine the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the live audience, not the survey respondents.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the voting behavior of people who watched the debate and those who did not watch the debate.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the viewers' preference before the debate, not after the debate.
  Option E does not undermine the argument but supports it by suggesting that Lopez won the election by a narrow margin, which means that the survey respondents who favored Lopez's arguments may have been biased in his favor.
  Therefore, none of the options undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is a possible counterargument to the argument.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument because the live audience's opinion does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the survey respondents.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D strengthens the argument.
  Option E does not undermine the argument because it does not show that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.

  Option B does not undermine the argument because it talks about the live audience, not the survey respondents.
  Option C does not undermine the argument because it talks about the likelihood of voting for Tanner, not the survey respondents.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the idea that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E does not weaken the idea that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Therefore, none of the options undermine the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that the viewers who thought Lopez made better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez because he eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to show that the viewers' perception of Lopez's arguments was not influenced by the fact that he won the election.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it talks about people who did not watch the debate.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the live audience, not the viewers surveyed after the debate.
  Choice C is also irrelevant because it talks about the voting behavior of people who watched the debate, not their perception of the arguments.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it talks about the viewers' intention to vote, not their perception of the arguments.
  Choice E is the most relevant because it suggests that Lopez's victory was not a clear indication of his superiority in the debate, which weakens the argument that the viewers' perception of his arguments was influenced by the fact that he won the election.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the survey respondents were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument because the survey respondents are not the same as the live audience.
  Option C does not undermine the argument because it does not show that the survey respondents were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option D strengthens the argument because it shows that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not undermine the argument because the argument is about the survey respondents, not the live audience.
  Choice C actually supports the argument because it suggests that the viewers who watched the debate were more likely to vote for Tanner, which means that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E does not undermine the argument because the margin of victory is not relevant to the argument.

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.

  The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to support the psychologist's argument that expressing gratitude is a personal interaction that reinforces beneficial behaviors.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion.

Topic: Law
Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the patient's knowledge of the treatment can lead to improvement in their condition, which means that the improvement in the first group could be due to the placebo effect.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment could have influenced the results.
  Option E weakens the physician's conclusion that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  To counter this argument, we need to find a statement that weakens the physician's conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the patients in the first group may have reported a reduction in pain simply because they knew they were receiving treatment, not because the magnets were effective.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about medication, not magnets.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about other areas of the body, not the back.
  Option D suggests that the scientists who designed the experiment may have had a bias towards magnetic fields, but this does not necessarily mean that the results are invalid.
  Option E suggests that the wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain may have affected the results of the experiment.
  Option E weakens the physician's argument by suggesting that the reduction in pain reported by the patients in the first group may have been due to factors other than the magnets.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument also claims that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the reasoning is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by suggesting that the prevalence of H pylori is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal while M tuberculosis is not.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument uses the example of M tuberculosis, which also only causes sickness in less than 10% of people who harbor it, but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Option C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is a clear difference from H pylori.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal even though only about 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of tuberculosis to the duration of ulcers caused by H pylori, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is the correct answer because it shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed because people who harbor M tuberculosis do not derive any benefit from its presence, whereas the argument claims that H pylori allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  Choice D and E are also irrelevant because they do not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers, despite the fact that it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes ulcers in less than 10% of those who harbor it.

  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which suggests that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal even though it causes tuberculosis in only a small percentage of people.
  The argument assumes that the only factor that determines whether a bacterium is a commensal is the percentage of people who get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to show that there are other factors that determine whether a bacterium is a commensal.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, suggests that the presence of a bacterium alone is not enough to make it a commensal.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument then compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal is that it can cause tuberculosis.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to show that there is another reason why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal.
  Choice C provides an alternative reason why M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument also claims that M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not provide any benefits to people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the argument's criteria for what constitutes a commensal are flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by showing that the prevalence of a bacterium in a population does not determine whether it is a commensal or not.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which does not provide any benefits to the people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of tuberculosis and stomach ulcers, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which means that even if H pylori causes stomach ulcers in some people, it still provides benefits to a larger number of people.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E, however, suggests that H pylori is more common than M tuberculosis, which weakens the argument's claim that H pylori cannot be a commensal because it causes harm in some people.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that H. pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  The argument compares H. pylori to M. tuberculosis, which does not confer any benefits to the host.
  To undermine the argument, we need to show that the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning and does not undermine it.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

  The mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is described as follows:
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
  Secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is best described as a relationship between essential and non-essential components that contribute to the overall characteristics of the plant.
  The relationship between electrical power and generators, mechanical components and features of automobiles, and braking systems of trains are not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  The relationship between mechanical components and electrical components in clothing factories is somewhat analogous, but the relationship between the two types of components is not essential to the operation of the factory in the same way that primary and secondary substances are essential to the growth and survival of plants.
  The relationship between specially designed word processing programs and computers is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. 
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

### Model comprehensive-100 | Agent chain_of_thought | Exam: comprehensive-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Context: \section{Passage 1}I have shown how democracy destroys or modifies the different inequalities which originate in society; but is this all? or does it not ultimately affect  that great inequality of man and woman which hasseemed, up to the present day, to be eternally based in human nature? I believe that the social changes which bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman andmake her more and more the equal of man. But here, more than ever, I feel the necessity of making myself clearly understood; for there is no subject on which the coarse and lawless fancies of our age have taken a freer range.There are people in Europe who, confounding together the different characteristics of the sexes, would make of man and woman beings not only equal but alike. They would give to both the same functions, impose on both the same duties, and grant20 to both the same rights; they would mix them in all things-their occupations, their pleasures, their business. It may readily be conceived, that by thus attempting to make one sex equal to the other, both are degraded; and from so preposterous a medley of 25 the works of nature nothing could ever result but weak men and disorderly women.It is not thus that the Americans understand that species of democratic equality which may be established between the sexes. They admit, that as 30 nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties; and they hold that improvement does not consist in making beings 35 so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner. The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, 40 by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.\section{Passage 2}As society was constituted until the last few generations, inequality was its very basis; association 45 grounded on equal rights scarcely existed; to be equals was to be enemies; two persons could hardly coöperate in anything, or meet in any amicable relation, without the law's appointing that one of them should be the superior of the other.50 Mankind have outgrown this state, and all things now tend to substitute, as the general principle of human relations, a just equality, instead of the dominion of the strongest. But of all relations, that between men and women, being the nearest and55 most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions, was sure to be the last to throw off the old rule, and receive the new; for, in proportion to the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and60 circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated. ...... The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete 65 liberty of choice.... Let every occupation be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be70 no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial; and the world will have the benefit of the best75 faculties of all its inhabitants. But to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only80 in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the85 qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
Question: Which choice best describes the ways that the two authors conceive of the individual's proper position in society?
Choices:
  A: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be defined in important ways by that individual's sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.
  B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.
  C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.

Topic: English
Context: In an experimental study we investigated whether.twig tool use in woodpecker finches is acquired.socially. This seemed plausible since previous studies.have shown that several forms of tool use in primates.develop via social learning. We took whole broods.from the Galapagos Islands. We split each brood into.two groups: half of the chicks were reared with a tool-.using model, and the other half were reared with a.non-tool-using model. We found that young.woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to.watch tool use develop this ability with similar.aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps.that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented.behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were.given the chance to observe tool use in adult.woodpecker finches. We concluded that, in contrast.to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for.the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker.finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to.be strongly dependent on genetically fixed.components. Interestingly, New Caledonian crows.also appear to have a specific genetic predisposition.for tool use, as demonstrated by the finding that they.develop basic use of stick tools without a tool-using.model. However, in contrast to our study, a tool-.using demonstrator (a human in the study on New.Caledonian crows) stimulated faster development of.tool use in juvenile New Caledonian crows. Field.observations also show that New Caledonian crow.parents scaffold the development of wide tool.manufacture and use in juveniles for up to one year..Juveniles stay close to their parents and are provided.with discarded tools. The early exposure to this.discarded tool might help juveniles to form a mental.template of functional tool design..Information about woodpecker finches’ social.system can shed some light on the reasons for the.strong genetic predetermination of tool use in this.species. For one thing, in contrast to socially living.primates, woodpecker finches are solitary and thus.parents are likely to be the only available tool-using.models. In such a system, reliance on social.transmission from parents to offspring during an.association would be a highly risky endeavor. Where.the likelihood of encountering important social.information is uncertain, selection for a development.process based on genetically fixed components could.be advantageous, especially given that tool use.provides an important part of the woodpecker finch’s.diet and seems crucial to survival during the dry.season in the islands’ Arid Zone..Although our experiment showed that the.development of tool use is based on a very specific.genetic predisposition, we were able to demonstrate.that non-social, individual learning does play an.important role during the ontogeny [development.within an organism’s lifetime] of tool use in serving.to improve the efficiency of this behavior. Five.individuals developed tool-using techniques that.deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the.wild, most likely because our artificial crevices.differed from natural crevices and tree holes. At some.point during the study, each of these birds dropped.their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out.with an upward motion of their beak, thereby.levering the prey to within reach at the front of the.crevice. After initial success with this technique, the.five birds significantly increased their use of this.method. These and other observations on learning in.tool-using woodpecker finches have altered our.conception of how this behavior develops. The.ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is.determined by a very specific genetic component, but.is enhanced through individual learning.
Question: Based on the passage, the researchers’ conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that
Choices:
  A: no genetic variations were common to all those finches that were not also common to all the finches that did not use that technique.
  B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
  C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

Context: Passage 2 is Grimké's response to Beecher.\section{Passage 1}Heaven has appointed to one sex the superior, and to the other the subordinate station, and this without any reference to the character or conduct of  either. It is therefore as much for the dignity as it isfor the interest of females, in all respects to conform to the duties of this relation. ... But while woman holds a subordinate relation in society to the other sex, it is not because it was designed that her duties or her influence should be any the less important, or 10 all-pervading. But it was designed that the mode of gaining influence and of exercising power should be altogether different and peculiar....A man may act on society by the collision of intellect, in public debate; he may urge his measures15 by a sense of shame, by fear and by personal interest; he may coerce by the combination of public sentiment; he may drive by physical force, and he does not outstep the boundaries of his sphere. But all the power, and all the conquests that are lawful to20 woman, are those only which appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.Woman is to win every thing by peace and love; by making herself so much respected, esteemed and loved, that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her25 wishes, will be the free-will offering of the heart. But this is to be all accomplished in the domestic and social circle. There let every woman become so cultivated and refined in intellect, that her taste and judgment will be respected; so benevolent in feeling30 and action; that her motives will be reverenced;-so unassuming and unambitious, that collision and competition will be banished;-so "gentle and easy to be entreated," as that every heart will repose in her presence; then, the fathers, the husbands, and the35 sons, will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly....A woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex, to assist her in her 40 appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty; but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict-whatever obliges her in any way to exert 45 coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere. If these general principles are correct, they are entirely opposed to the plan of arraying females in any Abolition movement.\section{Passage 2}The investigation of the rights of the slave has led 50 me to a better understanding of my own. I have found the Anti-Slavery cause to be the high school of morals in our land-the school in which human rights are more fully investigated, and better understood and taught, than in any other. Here a 55 great fundamental principle is uplifted and illuminated, and from this central light, rays innumerable stream all around.Human beings have rights, because they are moral beings: the rights of all men grow out of their moral 60 nature; and as all men have the same moral nature, they have essentially the same rights. These rights may be wrested from the slave, but they cannot be alienated: his title to himself is as perfect now, as is that of Lyman Beecher: ${ }^{1}$ it is stamped on his moral 65 being, and is, like it, imperishable. Now if rights are founded in the nature of our moral being, then the mere circumstance of sex does not give to man higher rights and responsibilities, than to woman. To suppose that it does, would be to deny the 70 self-evident truth, that the "physical constitution is the mere instrument of the moral nature." To suppose that it does, would be to break up utterly the relations, of the two natures, and to reverse their functions, exalting the animal nature into a monarch, 75 and humbling the moral into a slave; making the former a proprietor, and the latter its property.When human beings are regarded as moral beings, sex, instead of being enthroned upon the summit, administering upon rights and80 responsibilities, sinks into insignificance and nothingness. My doctrine then is, that whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do. Our duties originate, not from difference of sex, but from the diversity of our85 relations in life, the various gifts and talents committed to our care, and the different eras in which we live.1 Lyman Beecher was a famous minister and the father of Catharine Beecher.

Topic: English
Context: I think I cannot open my address more.appropriately than by stating my experience in my.long connection with the reform movement..It was during the great railroad strike of 1877 that.I first became interested in what is known as the.“Labor Question.”^1 I then thought as many thousands.of earnest, sincere people think, that the aggregate.power operating in human society, known as.government, could be made an instrument in the.hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings..But a closer study of the origin, history and tendency.of governments convinced me that this was a mistake..I came to understand how organized governments.used their concentrated power to retard progress by.their ever-ready means of silencing the voice of.discontent if raised in vigorous protest against the.machinations of the scheming few, who always did,.always will and always must rule in the councils of.nations where majority rule is recognized as the only.means of adjusting the affairs of the people..I came to understand that such concentrated.power can be always wielded in the interest of the few.and at the expense of the many. Government in its.last analysis is this power reduced to a science..Governments never lead; they follow progress. When.the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the.voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a.step, but not until then..I will state this contention in another way: I.learned by close study that it made no difference what.fair promises a political party, out of power, might.make to the people in order to secure their.confidence, when once securely established in control.of the affairs of society; that they were after all but.human with all the human attributes of the politician..Among these are: First, to remain in power at all.hazards; if not individually, then those holding.essentially the same views as the administration must.be kept in control. Second, in order to keep in power,.it is necessary to build up a powerful machine; one.strong enough to crush all opposition and silence all.vigorous murmurs of discontent, or the party.machine might be smashed and the party thereby lose.control..When I came to realize the faults, failings,.shortcomings, aspirations and ambitions of fallible.man, I concluded that it would not be the safest nor.best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the.management of all its affairs, with all their manifold.deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite.man, to be managed by the party which happened to.come into power, and therefore was the majority.party, nor did it then, nor does it now make one.particle of difference to me what a party out of power.may promise; it does not tend to allay my fears of.[what] a party, when entrenched and securely seated.in power might do to crush opposition, and silence.the voice of the minority, and thus retard the onward.step of progress..My mind is appalled at the thought of a political.party having control of all the details that go to make.up the sum total of our lives. Think of it for an.instant, that the party in power shall have all.authority to dictate the kind of books that shall be.used in our schools and universities; government.officials editing, printing, and circulating our.literature, histories, magazines and press, to say.nothing of the thousand and one activities of life that.a people engage in, in a civilized society..To my mind, the struggle for liberty is too great.and the few steps we have gained have been won at.too great a sacrifice, for the great mass of the people.of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to.any political party the management of our social and.industrial affairs. For all who are at all familiar with.history know that men will abuse power when they.possess it. For these and other reasons, I, after careful.study, and not through sentiment, turned from a.sincere, earnest, political Socialist^2 to the non-.political phase of Socialism—Anarchism^3 —because.in its philosophy I believe I can find the proper.conditions for the fullest development of the.individual units in society, which can never be the.case under government restrictions..(^1) The question of how to preserve the rights of the worker in an.industrial society.(^2) One who espouses a belief that the production and distribution of.goods should be controlled by the government.(^3) A belief that opposes any form of authority in society

Topic: English
Context: Large competitors are often viewed as a major.threat for startups and small companies; big.companies have more financial resources and greater.scale, market power and brand awareness than.smaller ones. However, our research finds that a.smaller brand can actually benefit if consumers can.see the competitive threat it faces from a larger.organization..When a U.S.-based ice cream chain with about 1,400 stores moved within 50 steps of a J.P. Licks ice.cream store in Newton, Massachusetts, some people.expected that J.P. Licks, a small, locally owned.company, would be beaten out of the Newton market..But consumers rallied around J.P. Licks, and the.national chain later closed its nearby location. When.the owner of the Los Angeles-based coffee store chain.The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf could not stop a large.coffee shop chain from moving in next door, he was.surprised to see his sales shoot up—so much so that.he started proactively colocating new stores next to.large chain ones..These examples are not anomalies. In six lab and.field studies, we explored the effects of having a large,.dominant competitor and found that highlighting a.large competitor’s size and close proximity can help.smaller brands, instead of harming them. Compared.to when they are in competition with brands that are.similar to them in size or when consumers view them.outside of a competitive context, small brands see.consumer support go up when they are faced with a.competitive threat from large brands. This support.translates into higher purchase intention, more.purchases and more favorable online reviews..As part of our research, we conducted a field study.at an independent bookstore in Cambridge,.Massachusetts. Upon entering the bookstore, 163.prospective shoppers were exposed to one of three.versions of an in-store ad, emphasizing either the.store’s large competitors, small competitors or no.competition. Shoppers who read the “large.competitors” version were told that the store’s main.competitors are large corporations that have the.ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore.out of business. The “small competitors” version.indicated the store’s main competitors are other.locally owned small bookstores in Cambridge. In the.“no competition” version, participants were given no.information about the competitive environment..Shoppers were then given a $5 coupon, coded with.the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing.shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed.coupons, we found that shoppers were significantly.more likely to make a purchase after reading the.“large competitors” version of the in-store ad,.compared to the “small competitors” version or the.“no competition” version. They also purchased more.items and spent more money at the store, compared.to shoppers reading the “small competitors” or “no.competition” versions. These results suggest that.framing the competitive game and emphasizing a.competitive narrative against a larger company can.help a small establishment—and spur consumers to.make a purchase that supports the smaller.competitor..In subsequent studies, we tested this “framing-.the-game” effect in various contexts and product.categories and further found that support for a large.brand decreases when consumers view it as being in.competition with a smaller brand. In one study, we.asked participants to assess two hypothetical rival tire.shops, “Tire World” and “Tire Planet,” under three.conditions—small vs. large, small vs. small or large.vs. large competitors. While participants indicated no.preference for the small or large shop when it was.competing against a competitor of similar size, the.small vs. large competitive context elicited a strong.preference for the small rather than large shop.

Topic: English
Context: Lady Carlotta stepped out on to the platform of the small wayside station and took a turn or two up and down its uninteresting length, to kill time till the  train should be pleased to proceed on its way. Then,in the roadway beyond, she saw a horse struggling with a more than ample load, and a carter of the sort that seems to bear a sullen hatred against the animal that helps him to earn a living. Lady Carlotta promptly betook her to the roadway, and put rather a 10 different complexion on the struggle. Certain of her acquaintances were wont to give her plentiful admonition as to the undesirability of interfering on behalf of a distressed animal, such interference being "none of her business." Only once had she put the 1 doctrine of non-interference into practice, when one of its most eloquent exponents had been besieged for nearly three hours in a small and extremely uncomfortable may-tree by an angry boar-pig, while Lady Carlotta, on the other side of the fence, had20 proceeded with the water-colour sketch she was engaged on, and refused to interfere between the boar and his prisoner. It is to be feared that she lost the friendship of the ultimately rescued lady. On this occasion she merely lost the train, which gave way to 25 the first sign of impatience it had shown throughout the journey, and steamed off without her. She bore the desertion with philosophical indifference; her friends and relations were thoroughly well used to the fact of her luggage arriving without her.30 She wired a vague non-committal message to her destination to say that she was coming on "by another train." Before she had time to think what her next move might be she was confronted by an imposingly attired lady, who seemed to be taking a 35 prolonged mental inventory of her clothes and looks."You must be Miss Hope, the governess I've come to meet," said the apparition, in a tone that admitted of very little argument."Very well, if I must I must," said Lady Carlotta to 40 herself with dangerous meekness."I am Mrs. Quabarl," continued the lady; "and where, pray, is your luggage?""It's gone astray," said the alleged governess, falling in with the excellent rule of life that the absent 45 are always to blame; the luggage had, in point of fact, behaved with perfect correctitude. "I've just telegraphed about it," she added, with a nearer approach to truth."How provoking," said Mrs. Quabarl; "these 50 railway companies are so careless. However, my maid can lend you things for the night," and she led the way to her car.During the drive to the Quabarl mansion Lady Carlotta was impressively introduced to the 55 nature of the charge that had been thrust upon her; she learned that Claude and Wilfrid were delicate, sensitive young people, that Irene had the artistic temperament highly developed, and that Viola was something or other else of a mould equally60 commonplace among children of that class and type in the twentieth century."I wish them not only to be TAUGHT," said Mrs. Quabarl, "but INTERESTED in what they learn. In their history lessons, for instance, you must try to65 make them feel that they are being introduced to the life-stories of men and women who really lived, not merely committing a mass of names and dates to memory. French, of course, I shall expect you to talk at meal-times several days in the week."70 "I shall talk French four days of the week and Russian in the remaining three.""Russian? My dear Miss Hope, no one in the house speaks or understands Russian.""That will not embarrass me in the least," said 75 Lady Carlotta coldly.Mrs. Quabarl, to use a colloquial expression, was knocked off her perch. She was one of those imperfectly self-assured individuals who are magnificent and autocratic as long as they are not80 seriously opposed. The least show of unexpected resistance goes a long way towards rendering them cowed and apologetic. When the new governess failed to express wondering admiration of the large newly-purchased and expensive car, and lightly85 alluded to the superior advantages of one or two makes which had just been put on the market, the discomfiture of her patroness became almost abject. Her feelings were those which might have animated a general of ancient warfaring days, on beholding his 90 heaviest battle-elephant ignominiously driven off the field by slingers and javelin throwers.

Topic: English
Context: Texas gourd vines unfurl their large, flared.blossoms in the dim hours before sunrise. Until they.close at noon, their yellow petals and mild, squashy.aroma attract bees that gather nectar and shuttle.pollen from flower to flower. But “when you.advertise [to pollinators], you advertise in an.open communication network,” says chemical.ecologist Ian Baldwin of the Max Planck Institute for.Chemical Ecology in Germany. “You attract not just.the good guys, but you also attract the bad guys.” For.a Texas gourd plant, striped cucumber beetles are.among the very bad guys. They chew up pollen and.petals, defecate in the flowers and transmit the.dreaded bacterial wilt disease, an infection that can.reduce an entire plant to a heap of collapsed tissue in.mere days..In one recent study, Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.took on the specific problem of the Texas.gourd—how to attract enough pollinators but not.too many beetles. The Texas gourd vine’s main.pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash.bees, which respond to its floral scent. The aroma.includes 10 compounds, but the most.abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees.into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene..Intuition suggests that more of that aroma should.be even more appealing to bees. “We have this.assumption that a really fragrant flower is going to.attract a lot of pollinators,” says Theis, a chemical.ecologist at Elms College in Chicopee,.Massachusetts. But, she adds, that idea hasn’t really.been tested—and extra scent could well call in more.beetles, too. To find out, she and Adler planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and,.throughout the August flowering season, made half.the plants more fragrant by tucking.dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their.flowers. Each treated flower emitted about 45 times.more fragrance than a normal one; the other half of.the plants got swabs without fragrance..The researchers also wanted to know whether.extra beetles would impose a double cost by both.damaging flowers and deterring bees, which might.not bother to visit (and pollinate) a flower laden with.other insects and their feces. So every half hour.throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the.beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and.half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to.the blossoms with and without interference by.beetles..Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female.flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance.and beetles. Hand-pollinated flowers should develop.into fruits with the maximum number of seeds,.providing a benchmark to see whether the.fragrance-related activities of bees and beetles.resulted in reduced pollination..“It was very labor intensive,” says Theis..“We would be out there at four in the morning, three.in the morning, to try and set up before these flowers.open.” As soon as they did, the team spent the next.several hours walking from flower to flower,.observing each for two-minute intervals “and writing.down everything we saw.”.What they saw was double the normal number of.beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms..Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the.highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent,.and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often.than normal ones. Theis thinks the bees were.repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the.abundance of beetles: The data showed that the more.beetles on a flower, the less likely a honey bee was to.visit it..That added up to less reproduction for.fragrance-enhanced flowers. Gourds that developed.from those blossoms weighed 9 percent less and had,.on average, 20 fewer seeds than those from normal.flowers. Hand pollination didn’t rescue the seed set,.indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.—regardless of whether they also repelled.pollinators. (Hand pollination did rescue fruit.weight, a hard-to-interpret result that suggests that.lost bee visits did somehow harm fruit development.).The new results provide a reason that Texas gourd.plants never evolved to produce a stronger scent: “If.you really ramp up the odor, you don’t get more.pollinators, but you can really get ripped apart by.your enemies,” says Rob Raguso, a chemical ecologist.at Cornell University who was not involved in the.Texas gourd study.

Context: Unlike the gold which needed nothing, and must be worshipped in close-locked solitude - which was hidden away from the daylight, was deaf to the song  of birds, and started to no human tones-Eppie was a 5 creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements; making trial of everything, with trust in new joy, and stirring the human kindness in all eyes that looked on her. The gold had kept his10 thoughts in an ever-repeated circle, leading to nothing beyond itself; but Eppie was an object compacted of changes and hopes that forced his thoughts onward, and carried them far away from their old eager pacing towards the same blank15 limit-carried them away to the new things that would come with the coming years, when Eppie would have learned to understand how her father Silas cared for her; and made him look for images of that time in the ties and charities that bound together 20 the families of his neighbors. The gold had asked that he should sit weaving longer and longer, deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web; but Eppie called him away from his weaving, and25 made him think all its pauses a holiday, reawakening his senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.30 And when the sunshine grew strong and lasting, so that the buttercups were thick in the meadows, Silas might be seen in the sunny mid-day, or in the late afternoon when the shadows were lengthening under the hedgerows, strolling out with uncovered35 head to carry Eppie beyond the Stone-pits to where the flowers grew, till they reached some favorite bank where he could sit down, while Eppie toddled to pluck the flowers, and make remarks to the winged things that murmured happily above the bright40 petals, calling "Dad-dad's" attention continually by bringing him the flowers. Then she would turn her ear to some sudden bird-note, and Silas learned to please her by making signs of hushed stillness, that they might listen for the note to come again: so that45 when it came, she set up her small back and laughed with gurgling triumph. Sitting on the banks in this way, Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of 50 crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit. As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her lifeunfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.It was an influence which must gather force with every new year: the tones that stirred Silas' heart60 grew articulate, and called for more distinct answers; shapes and sounds grew clearer for Eppie's eyes and ears, and there was more that "Dad-dad" was imperatively required to notice and account for. Also, by the time Eppie was three years old, she65 developed a fine capacity for mischief, and for devising ingenious ways of being troublesome, which found much exercise, not only for Silas' patience, but for his watchfulness and penetration. Sorely was poor Silas puzzled on such occasions by the incompatible 70 demands of love.

Topic: English
Context: Anyone watching the autumn sky knows that migrating birds fly in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, but scientists have long debated why. A new study of ibises finds  that these big-winged birds carefully position theirwingtips and sync their flapping, presumably to catch the preceding bird's updraft-and save energy during flight.There are two reasons birds might fly in a V formation: It may make flight easier, or they're  simply following the leader. Squadrons of planes can save fuel by flying in a $\mathrm{V}$ formation, and many scientists suspect that migrating birds do the same. Models that treated flapping birds like fixed-wing airplanes estimate that they save energy by draftingoff each other, but currents created by airplanes are far more stable than the oscillating eddies coming off of a bird. "Air gets pretty unpredictable behind a flapping wing," says James Usherwood, a locomotor biomechanist at the Royal Veterinary College at theUniversity of London in Hatfield, where the research took place.The study, published in Nature, took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises (Geronticus eremita) to Europe.Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy. A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab. The device's GPS determined each bird's flight 30 position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.Just as aerodynamic estimates would predict, the birds positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats35 to catch the uplifting eddies. When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body. "We didn't think this was possible," Usherwood 40 says, considering that the feat requires careful flight and incredible awareness of one's neighbors. "Perhaps these big V formation birds can be thought of quite like an airplane with wings that go up and down." 45 The findings likely apply to other long-winged birds, such as pelicans, storks, and geese, Usherwood says. Smaller birds create more complex wakes that would make drafting too difficult. The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings50 because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species. Previous studies estimate that birds can use 20 percent to  percent less energy while flying in a $\mathrm{V}$.55 "From a behavioral perspective it's really a breakthrough," says David Lentink, a mechanical engineer at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California, who was not involved in the work. "Showing that birds care about syncing their wing 60 beats is definitely an important insight that we didn't have before."Scientists do not know how the birds find that aerodynamic sweet spot, but they suspect that the animals align themselves either by sight or65 by sensing air currents through their feathers.Alternatively, they may move around until they find the location with the least resistance. In future studies, the researchers will switch to more common birds, such as pigeons or geese. They plan to70 investigate how the animals decide who sets the course and the pace, and whether a mistake made by the leader can ripple through the rest of the flock to cause traffic jams."It's a pretty impressive piece of work as it is, but 75 it does suggest that there's a lot more to learn," says Ty Hedrick, a biologist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, who studies flight aerodynamics in birds and insects. However they do it, he says, "birds are awfully good hang-glider 80 pilots."
Question: What can reasonably be inferred about the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study?
Choices:
  A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route.
  B: Usherwood knew the ibises were familiar with carrying data loggers during migration.

Topic: English
Context: Even then my only friends were made of paper and ink. At school I had learned to read and write long before the other children. Where my school  friends saw notches of ink on incomprehensiblepages, I saw light, streets, and people. Words and the mystery of their hidden science fascinated me, and I saw in them a key with which I could unlock a boundless world, a safe haven from that home, those streets, and those troubled days in which even Icould sense that only a limited fortune awaited me. My father didn't like to see books in the house. There was something about them-apart from the letters he could not decipher-that offended him. He used to tell me that as soon as I was ten he would 15 send me off to work and that I'd better get rid of all my scatterbrained ideas if I didn't want to end up a loser, a nobody. I used to hide my books under the mattress and wait for him to go out or fall asleep so that I could read. Once he caught me reading at night20 and flew into a rage. He tore the book from my hands and flung it out of the window."If I catch you wasting electricity again, reading all this nonsense, you'll be sorry."My father was not a miser and, despite the 25 hardships we suffered, whenever he could he gave me a few coins so that I could buy myself some treats like the other children. He was convinced that I spent them on licorice sticks, sunflower seeds, or sweets, but I would keep them in a coffee tin under the bed, 30 and when I'd collected four or five reales I'd secretly rush out to buy myself a book.My favorite place in the whole city was the Sempere \& Sons bookshop on Calle Santa Ana. It smelled of old paper and dust and it was my35 sanctuary, my refuge. The bookseller would let me sit on a chair in a corner and read any book I liked to my heart's content. He hardly ever allowed me to pay for the books he placed in my hands, but when he wasn't looking I'd leave the coins I'd managed to 40 collect on the counter before I left. It was only small change-if I'd had to buy a book with that pittance, I would probably have been able to afford only a booklet of cigarette papers. When it was time for me to leave, I would do so dragging my feet, a weight on $45 \mathrm{my}$ soul. If it had been up to me, I would have stayed there forever.One Christmas Sempere gave me the best gift I have ever received. It was an old volume, read and experienced to the full.50 "Great Expectations, by Charles Dickens," I read on the cover.I was aware that Sempere knew a few authors who frequented his establishment and, judging by the care with which he handled the volume, I thought 55 perhaps this Mr. Dickens was one of them."A friend of yours?""A lifelong friend. And from now on, he's your friend too." That afternoon I took my new friend home, 60 hidden under my clothes so that my father wouldn't see it. It was a rainy winter, with days as gray as lead, and I read Great Expectations about nine times, partly because I had no other book at hand, partly because I did not think there could be a better one in 65 the whole world and I was beginning to suspect that Mr. Dickens had written it just for me. Soon I was convinced that I didn't want to do anything else in life but learn to do what Mr. Dickens had done.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$Which of the following represents all the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation above?
Choices:
  A: 0 and 2
  B: 0 and 4
  C: -4 and 4
  D: 4
Response 0:
Thought:
  Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominators.
  Simplify the equation and solve for $x$.
  Check if the solution satisfies the original equation.
  
Action: Answer("B") 

Explanation:
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$\Rightarrow 2x(x-3)=2(x-3)x$$
  $$\Rightarrow 2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  $$\Rightarrow 0=0$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except $x=3$ (because the denominator of the left-hand side would be zero).
  Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 0 and 4, which are both valid solutions.
  To check:
  If $x=0$, then $\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{0}{-3}=0$ and $\frac{2 x}{2}=\frac{0}{2}=0$. The equation is true.
  If $x=4$, then $\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{4}{1}=4$ and $\frac{2 x}{2}=\frac{8}{2}=4$. The equation is true.
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can start by simplifying the equation by cross-multiplying:
  $$2(x-3)=x\times2$$
  $$2x-6=2x$$
  $$-6=0$$
  The equation is inconsistent, which means there is no value of $x$ that satisfies the equation.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can start by cross-multiplying both sides of the equation to eliminate the denominators.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2(x)(x-3)=(x-3)(2x)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  This equation is true for all values of $x$.
  However, we need to check if $x=3$ is a valid solution since it would make the denominator of the left-hand side of the original equation zero.
  If $x=3$, then the left-hand side of the original equation is undefined, and the equation is not satisfied.
  Therefore, all possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are all real numbers except $x=3$.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can start by cross-multiplying to get rid of the denominators.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of x.
  Therefore, the answer is all real numbers.
  The answer is not listed in the choices, so the closest option is C: -4 and 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominators.
  Simplify the equation and solve for $x$.
  Check if the solution satisfies the original equation.
  
Action: Answer("B")  
To solve the equation, we can cross-multiply and simplify:
$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{x-3}&=\frac{2 x}{2} \\ 2x(x-3)&=x(2x) \\ 2x^2-6x&=2x^2 \\ -6x&=0 \\ x&=0 \end{aligned}$$
However, $x=0$ is not a valid solution since it would make the denominator of the left-hand side equal to $-3$, which is not allowed. 
We need to check if $x=4$ is a valid solution:
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{4}{1}$$
$$\frac{4}{1}=4$$
Therefore, the only possible value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x=4$. 
The answer is B: 0 and 4.
Response 5:
Thought:
  Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominators.
  Simplify the equation and solve for $x$.
  Check if the solution satisfies the original equation.
  
Action: Answer("B") 0 and 4

Explanation:
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  $$0=0$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except $x=3$.
  Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 0 and 4. 
  To check, we can substitute $x=0$ and $x=4$ into the original equation:
  $$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2(0)}{2} \Rightarrow 0=0$$
  $$\frac{4}{4-3}=\frac{2(4)}{2} \Rightarrow 8=8$$
  Both solutions satisfy the original equation.
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can start by simplifying the equation by cross-multiplying:
  $$2(x-3)=x\times2$$
  $$2x-6=2x$$
  $$-6=0$$
  The equation is not true for any value of $x$.
  Therefore, there are no possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can start by cross-multiplying the equation to eliminate the fractions.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of x.
  Therefore, all real numbers are possible values of x that satisfy the equation.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can start by cross-multiplying to eliminate the fractions.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$\Rightarrow 2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$

Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
Thought:
  1 decagram = 10 grams
  1,000 milligrams = 1 gram
  1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams (by converting decagram to grams and then grams to milligrams)
  1 container of medicine = 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 200,000 milligrams
  We need to find how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container.
  Therefore, we need to divide 200,000 by 1 to get the number of 1-milligram doses.
  The answer is 200,000.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
- 1 decagram = 10 grams
- 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram
- 1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams (by multiplying 1 decagram by 10 and then by 1,000)
- 1 container of medicine is 2 decagrams
- 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams
- Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams of medicine in one container
- Each dose is 1 milligram
- Therefore, there are 20,000 doses in one container
- The answer is 20,000
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  1 decagram = 10 grams
  1,000 milligrams = 1 gram
  1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams (by converting decagram to grams and then grams to milligrams)
  1 container of medicine = 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 200,000 milligrams
  We need to find how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container.
  Therefore, we need to divide 200,000 by 1 to get the number of 1-milligram doses.
  The answer is 200,000.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  1 decagram = 10 grams
  1,000 milligrams = 1 gram
  1 milligram = 1/1000 gram
  1 decagram = 10 x 10 x 1/1000 milligrams = 100 milligrams

  1 container of medicine = 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 200,000 milligrams
  We want to find how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container.
  Therefore, we need to divide 200,000 by 1 to get the number of 1-milligram doses.
  The answer is B: 200.

Topic: Math
Question: A line in the $x y$-plane passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$. Which of the following points lies on the line?
Choices:
  A: $(0,7)$
  B: $(1,7)$
  C: $(7,7)$
  D: $(14,2)$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The line passes through the origin, so the $y$-intercept is $0$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every $1$ unit increase in $x$, the $y$ value increases by $\frac{1}{7}$.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  We can plug in the $x$ and $y$ values of each point to see which point lies on the line.
  For point A, $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, so it does not lie on the line.
  For point B, $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, so it does not lie on the line.
  For point C, $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, so it lies on the line.
  For point D, $2 \neq \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, so it does not lie on the line.
  Therefore, the point that lies on the line is C: $(7,7)$.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is satisfied.
  For point A, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0$, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, point A does not lie on the line.
  For point B, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, point B does not lie on the line.
  For point C, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1$, which is equal to 7. Therefore, point C lies on the line.
  For point D, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2$, which is not equal to 2. Therefore, point D does not lie on the line.
  Therefore, the point that lies on the line is C: $(7,7)$.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The line passes through the origin, which means the $x$-coordinate and $y$-coordinate of the point where the line intersects the $y$-axis is 0.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means for every 1 unit increase in the $x$-coordinate, the $y$-coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$ units.
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a line, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept, to find the equation of the line.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  We can substitute the $x$-coordinates of the answer choices into the equation to see which point lies on the line.
  A: $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, so $(0,7)$ is not on the line.
  B: $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, so $(1,7)$ is not on the line.
  C: $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, so $(7,7)$ is not on the line.
  D: $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, so $(14,2)$ is on the line.
  Therefore, the answer is D: $(14,2)$.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The line passes through the origin, which means the $y$-intercept is 0.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every 1 unit increase in $x$, the $y$-coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$.
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a line, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept, to find the equation of the line.
  Since the $y$-intercept is 0, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  We can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line to see which point lies on the line.
  Only point A satisfies the equation of the line.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A, $x = 0$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$, which is not true.
  For point B, $x = 1$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$, which is not true.
  For point C, $x = 7$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$, which is true.
  For point D, $x = 14$ and $y = 2$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $2 = \frac{1}{7}(14)$, which is true.
  Therefore, both point C and point D lie on the line.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A: $y = \frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, which is not true since the $y$-coordinate of point A is 7.
  For point B: $y = \frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not true since the $y$-coordinate of point B is 7.
  For point C: $y = \frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, which is not true since the $y$-coordinate of point C is 7.
  For point D: $y = \frac{1}{7}x = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, which is true since the $y$-coordinate of point D is also 2.
  Therefore, the point that lies on the line is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  Only point A satisfies the equation of the line.
  Therefore, the answer is A: $(0,7)$.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0$, which is not equal to 7. So point A does not lie on the line.
  For point B, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not equal to 7. So point B does not lie on the line.
  For point C, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1$, which is equal to 7. So point C lies on the line.
  For point D, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2$, which is not equal to 2. So point D does not lie on the line.
  Therefore, the point that lies on the line is C: $(7,7)$.
Action: Answer("C")

  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y values of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation holds true.
  For point A, $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, point A does not lie on the line.
  For point B, $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, point B does not lie on the line.
  For point C, $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, which is equal to 7. Therefore, point C lies on the line.
  For point D, $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, which is not equal to 2. Therefore, point D does not lie on the line.
  Therefore, the point that lies on the line is C: $(7,7)$.

Topic: Dental
Question: Which of the following has strong familial inheritance:
Choices:
  A: Functional class III
  B: Class I type I
  C: Class II div I
  D: Class II div II
Response 0:
Thought:
  Functional class III, Class I type I, Class II div I, and Class II div II are types of malocclusion.
  Familial inheritance is a factor that contributes to malocclusion.
  Therefore, one of the types of malocclusion listed has strong familial inheritance.
  Class II div I and Class II div II are characterized by an overjet, which is the horizontal distance between the upper and lower incisors.
  Class I type I is characterized by normal occlusion.
  Functional class III is characterized by a prognathic mandible, which means the lower jaw is more prominent than the upper jaw.
  Since Class II div I and Class II div II are the only types of malocclusion listed that have an overjet, and familial inheritance is a factor that contributes to malocclusion, it is likely that one of these two types has strong familial inheritance.
  The answer is either C: Class II div I or D: Class II div II.

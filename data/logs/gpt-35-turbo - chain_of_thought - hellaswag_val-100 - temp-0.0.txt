Choices:
  A: These have a sporty look that will go well with oversized t-shirts and jerseys. [title] Try leggings on before buying them to make sure they look and feel good.
  B: Look for leggings that are without padding or at least cling to your legs. These are thin cotton pieces with small straps and attached sleeves, around the top of your legs and neck.
  C: [title] Choose solid neutrals to avoid color schemes. [step] Since these garments are designed and created to create patterns on the basis of contrasting colors, you want to avoid anything off of these colors.
  D: It's easiest to make sure that your fabric is breathable when wearing leggings in the summer, though, particularly in colder months. If you're just getting started, you probably won't need to invest in underwear.

[header] How to fix bent glasses [title] Grab a pair of plastic-tipped pliers. [step] Pliers will allow you to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand. If possible, equip yourself with a pair that has a soft plastic coating on the tips.
Choices:
  A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. [substeps] If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.

  The most likely completion to the text is to provide additional information about the type of pliers to use and what to do if you don't have them.
  Choice A provides additional information about the type of pliers to use and what to do if you don't have them.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair stay straight all day [title] Use shampoos and conditioners that help straighten hair. [step] Look for shampoos and conditioners that have lots of vitamins and minerals in them, giving your hair refreshing nutrients that will help smooth it out. These are usually marketed as smoothing, sleek, or straightening products.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Look for a shampoo that lists " hydrating ingredients ", which are sodium and other all natural ingredients. You can also try going for one that specifically states " hydrating " on the bottle.
  B: [substeps] If you have very curly hair, you may need to consider using a straightening shampoo. You can also purchase a hair-straightening powder and conditioners to help moisturize your hair.
  C: If you have dry hair, look for shampoos that will keep it soft, wet, and shine. If you have hair that is frizzy, opt for sleek, volumizing, or foam shampoos.
  D: [substeps] Look for ingredients such as wheat proteins, pro vitamin b5, or hedera helix extract. Take the time to comb the conditioner into your hair while in the shower, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make a homemade ear cleaner [title] Get a small bottle. [step] You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap. [title] Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
Choices:
  A: [step] Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it. [substeps] Oil from your choice of product may not soften your ear canal to the point where it won't fit over a toothbrush.
  B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.
  C: [step] Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.
  D: [step] You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep dilufying the oil between 5-10 drops.

  The text is providing instructions on how to make a homemade ear cleaner.
  The first two steps are to get a small bottle and fill it with oil.
  The most likely completion to the text would be another step or substeps that provide additional instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Choice A talks about the size of the bottle and the possibility of the ear canal not fitting over a toothbrush, which is not relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Choice C talks about adding distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean and testing the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of the ear, which is not relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner either.
  Choice D talks about using any type of oil and diluting it to replicate a scent, which is not relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Choice B talks about using either mineral oil or olive oil, which are both oil-based cleaners that lubricate the ear canal. This is relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.

[substeps] A waxing product such as nair roll-on wax is a good choice because it has a roll-on applicator that dispenses an even amount of wax over the surface.
Choices:
  A: [title] Cut the waxing strips into small strips. [step] These can be bought (sometimes coming with the wax) or homemade.
  B: The adhesive also helps to prevent the wax from drying out. [title] Apply the wax to your hair, turning it around when you're done.
  C: Apply the wax to your hair in a nice, even layer. Start on the mid-hair--all the way up to the roots-and then remove the wax.
  D: Many can be purchased at beauty supply stores, large specialty stores, and drugstores and bookstores. [title] Consider using a facial wax to smooth hair.

[header] How to get oil out of hair [title] Shampoo your hair several times. [step] Use your regular shampoo to wash your hair in the shower. Really work the shampoo into your scalp using your fingers and rinse it out thoroughly with lukewarm water.
Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.
  B: Have a good conditioner available on hand for long-term use. [substeps] Because oil can build up if you're not getting it regular, don't rinse it out very often, as this may clog or unbalance the hair follicles.
  C: Repeat the process one or two more times, as needed. [substeps] After you finish shampooing, add some conditioner to your hair and let it sit for 5 minutes before rinsing out.
  D: [substeps] You can use a hairdryer, a microfiber cloth, or a shower cap to gently detangle your hair to avoid spreading the oil or holding your hair in. [title] Squeeze a dime-sized amount of shampoo from a bottle.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize fear in dogs [title] Look for the whites in a dog's eyes. [step] A dog who's tense or fearful may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal. A relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Some dogs may appear biting during relaxation or hiding from the thought of biting. The deweye dog flashes white teeth at the sight of blood, while another who exhibits an attacking psychological response may flinch or contort their faces into a fearful stare.
  B: The whites of a dog's eyes may look milky, gray, or bloodshot, or very pale. [substeps] A calm dog generally relaxes when frightened or depressed, and may not retreat from fearful moments.
  C: [substeps] Another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful is their pupils. The pupils normally dilate when they are calm or frightened.
  D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. [substeps] Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to dry shoes quickly [title] Look at the construction of your shoes. [step] If they are synthetic or cotton, without hard or gelled soles, they can go into the dryer. Leather, gel-core athletic shoes, clogs and gore-tex should not go into the washer or dryer.
Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.
  D: Synthetic synthetic shoes do not absorb as well as polyester/plastic soft shoes, so in most cases you will need to replace them later. [substeps] Steamers and other lubricants are best, but any dry pair of shoes should be fine.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to find the best foundation color shade for you [title] Understand your undertone. [step] Before trying to choose a foundation, it's best to determine a few things about your skin, such as your undertone. While the surface of your skin can change color because of many things, such as exposure to the elements or acne, your undertone will always stay the same.
Choices:
  A: Identifying your undertone is one of the best things you can do to find good foundation color. [substeps] It is possible that you have a bluish undertone, and if you work in an environment with low light, you likely have both.
  B: Therefore, determining your undertone will help you choose the right foundation color. In general, people fall into one of three undertones : [substeps] Cool, which means your skin is more blue, red, or pink.
  C: [substeps] People with a warm complexion typically have warmer undertones than people with a neutral complexion. Choose a foundation that's somewhere between a warm and neutral shade.
  D: Recognizing your undertone can help you put a good image of yourself in the face. [substeps] If you have olive-toned skin, you will likely have a more neutral undertone.

Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.

If you don't particularly want to highlight your curves, pick short skirts or dresses that fall nicely and that hug your waist without drapes.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  B: Lycra is the natural hair that grows throughout a person's legs, shoulders, and calves. You need to eat at least four servings of lycra per day, and have from three meals.
  C: The number and duration of all three processes in a daily cycle will vary based on your personal styling style. Consult your hair stylist as they can help you with specific on-the-job textures and techniques.
  D: Keratin is a protein that forms a pool on or around all of your hair follicles. It works by cooling your hair down, helping to hold its volume.

  B: [substeps] You can buy the shears from beauty supply stores or the hair care section of most department stores. [title] Begin working with clean, dry hair.
  C: They tend to be thicker than straight-ended scissors, but should also be less dense with their blades. [title] Buy extra-long (thicker) growth shears to grow stubble.
  D: [substeps] If you plan to thin your hair in small sections or strands, make sure you buy a pair of thinning shears for each segment of hair. You only need two thinning shears, one for your top coat and one for your bottom layer.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to apply eyeliner to small round eyes [title] Apply a light-colored eyeliner to your waterline. [step] Use a white or nude colored eyeliner for the best results. Light colors will open and brighten your eyes so they look bigger.
Choices:
  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.
  B: Focus on your waterline when working with eyeliner. [substeps] For more precise eye work, get a small eye brush (such as a toothpick, eyebrow brush, or electric wand), and water that goes with eyeliner on smaller, streaky areas.
  C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  D: [substeps] Only use white eyeliner for brown eyes. Otherwise, the eyeliner won't pop as much and will sink into your eyebrows and make your eyes look round.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

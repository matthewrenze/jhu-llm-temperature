[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Choices:
  A: Rinse your hair as soon as possible after it is done, as prolonged washing can hurt the scalp. [title] Dry your hair as soon as possible.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.

    C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
    D: fails, other times he is successful.
  Option A doesn't seem likely because if he lifts so far he is dragged to the ground, he would not be able to continue training.
  Option B doesn't seem likely because the text says he lifts it over his head, not that he puts it down.
  Option C doesn't seem likely because it doesn't make sense in the context of weightlifting.
  Option D seems likely because it suggests that he is practicing and sometimes he is successful and other times he fails.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  The options are:
    A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
    B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
    C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
    D: fails, other times he is successful.
  Option A doesn't seem likely as it is not safe and doesn't make sense.
  Option B doesn't seem likely as it doesn't make sense in the context of weightlifting training.
  Option C doesn't seem likely as it is not a proper weightlifting technique.
  Option D seems likely as it is common to fail in weightlifting training and sometimes be successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weights over his head several times.
  The text then says "sometimes he" which implies that the next sentence will describe something that happens occasionally.
  The options A, B, and C do not make sense in the context of weightlifting.
  Option D makes sense because weightlifting is a difficult sport and athletes often fail before they succeed.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "sometimes he fails, other times he is successful."
  The answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")

    C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
    D: fails, other times he is successful.
  Option A doesn't seem likely as it is unlikely that the man would lift so much weight that he would be dragged to the ground.
  Option B doesn't seem likely either as it doesn't make sense to put the weight down to raise it above his head.
  Option C doesn't make sense either as it is not clear what is meant by "lowers his arms and his hands up".
  Option D seems like the most likely answer as it suggests that the man is attempting to lift the weight and sometimes he is successful while other times he fails.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.

  Option A is unlikely because it is not safe to lift weights so far that you are dragged to the ground.
  Option B is also unlikely because it does not make sense to put the weight down to raise it above his head.
  Option C is not likely because it is not clear what it means to lower his arms and his hands up.

[step] Before trying to choose a foundation, it's best to determine a few things about your skin, such as your undertone.

  C: [substeps] People with a warm complexion typically have warmer undertones than people with a neutral complexion. Choose a foundation that's somewhere between a warm and neutral shade.
  D: Recognizing your undertone can help you put a good image of yourself in the face. [substeps] If you have olive-toned skin, you will likely have a more neutral undertone.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.

[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

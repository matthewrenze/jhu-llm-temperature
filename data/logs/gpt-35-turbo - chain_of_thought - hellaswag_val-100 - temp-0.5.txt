Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Choices:
  A: dances and people watch it flame.
  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should provide an appropriate continuation of the description.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B describes the fire growing in size, which is possible, but there is no indication in the text that this is happening.
  Option C describes the process of lighting a campfire, which is not relevant to the current situation.
  Option D describes a dangerous situation where the fire is spreading rapidly across the ground, which is not consistent with the original text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  A campfire is a controlled fire that is used for warmth, cooking, and entertainment.
  The phrase "burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" is a continuation of the previous sentence and refers to the campfire.
  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely completion because it describes the movement of the flames and the activity of people around the fire.
  The other choices do not fit the context of the sentence.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The options A and C describe how people might interact with the fire, but do not describe what happens to the fire itself.
  Option D is unlikely because a fire that rapidly spreads across the ground is not a controlled campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the fire slowly grows in size.
  The answer is B: slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The sentence mentions that the campfire is burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" suggests that the fire is already burning at its peak.
  The sentence does not suggest that the fire is growing or spreading.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a campfire that is already burning.
  The next sentence should describe what the fire is doing or how it is behaving.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also possible, but not as likely as option A.
  Option C describes how to light a campfire and put it out, but this is not a likely completion to the given text.
  Option D describes a fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a desirable outcome for a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The first sentence mentions that "the fire" is already burning, so the next sentence should describe how the fire behaves.
  Choice A is plausible, but it is not specific enough to describe how the fire behaves.
  Choice B is not likely because the fire is already burning brightly.
  Choice C is not likely because it describes how to light and put out a fire, not how the fire behaves.
  Choice D is not likely because it describes a dangerous situation that is not desirable.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outside for warmth, cooking, and/or entertainment.
  The phrase "burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already lit and burning well.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the text is describing the fire itself.
  The phrase "dances" suggests that the fire is flickering and moving.
  The phrase "people watch it flame" suggests that people are observing the fire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The sentence mentions that a campfire is burning brightly in the night.
  The sentence also mentions "the fire".
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, but it does not indicate any change in the fire.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is a likely outcome of a campfire.
  Option C describes a process of lighting and putting out the fire that does not fit the context of the sentence.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a desirable outcome.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the fire slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a campfire that is already burning.
  The second sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Option A seems like a reasonable completion to the sentence.
  Option B could be a possibility, but the word "slowly" seems to contradict the word "brightly" in the first sentence.
  Option C seems to describe the process of starting and putting out a fire, not what happens after it is already burning.
  Option D is unlikely because a rapidly spreading fire would be dangerous and not desirable in a camping situation.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the sentence is going to provide more information about the fire.
  Option A describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame, which is a possible completion but doesn't provide new information about the fire.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is a possible completion but doesn't provide new information about the fire.
  Option C describes the fire being lit from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill, which is an unlikely completion given the context of the sentence.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is an unlikely completion given the context of the sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.

[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

  The text does not mention anything about hair hydration, but it mentions that shampoos and conditioners with vitamins and minerals help smooth out hair.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: [substeps] Look for ingredients such as wheat proteins, pro vitamin b5, or hedera helix extract. Take the time to comb the conditioner into your hair while in the shower, using your fingers or a wide-toothed comb.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  Option C makes sense as the player is trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  Option D is not a likely completion to the sentence as it is negative and does not follow the flow of the sentence.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  B: Lycra is the natural hair that grows throughout a person's legs, shoulders, and calves. You need to eat at least four servings of lycra per day, and have from three meals.
  C: The number and duration of all three processes in a daily cycle will vary based on your personal styling style. Consult your hair stylist as they can help you with specific on-the-job textures and techniques.
  D: Keratin is a protein that forms a pool on or around all of your hair follicles. It works by cooling your hair down, helping to hold its volume.

  The answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The completion should describe what happens after she jumps over the bar.
  Option A says that she lands on a mat, marking her dark score. However, the phrase "dark score" does not make sense in this context.
  Option B says that she is shown performing the act again in slow motion. This option is a possibility, but it is not the most likely completion of the text.
  Option C says that she lands on the grass with her arms outstretched. This option is not likely because high jump competitions are usually held on a mat, not on grass.
  Option D says that she lands on a mat behind her. This option is the most likely completion of the text because high jump competitions are usually held on a mat and the phrase "behind her" indicates that she cleared the bar and landed on the mat.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a girl running down a track and taking a huge jump.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to attract barn owls [title] Keep your shed open to the wild. [step] Clear everything out and give it a bit of a dust, and a barn owl will probably make a nest in there. [substeps] Make sure you leave the door open for the barn owls.
Choices:
  A: They can climb in, if they do not have wings or owls need air. Consider bringing a pair of wooden wading poles to keep them out.
  B: This way, they won't be able to climb in! [title] Provide enough shelter. [step] The barn owl might stumble into something on the way home from a trip to town.
  C: Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them. [title] Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground.
  D: Barn owls aren't allowed to come too close to your barn entrance, so they shouldn't come in. [title] Purchase an owl-repellent.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text is about attracting barn owls.
  Step one is to keep the shed open to the wild and clear everything out.
  Step two is to leave the door open for the barn owls.
  Choice A talks about keeping the barn owls out, which is not what the text is about.
  Choice B talks about providing shelter, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Choice C talks about putting a bird box on a pole, which is not related to keeping the shed open.
  Choice D talks about purchasing an owl-repellent, which is the opposite of what the text is trying to achieve.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to say "Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them." and then add a new step titled "Provide enough shelter" that explains how to make the shed a suitable habitat for the barn owls.
  The answer is C: Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them. [title] Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The title says "Keep your shed open to the wild", which implies that the barn owls should be able to easily fly in and out of the shed.
  The step says "Make sure you leave the door open for the barn owls", which reinforces the idea that the shed should be open.
  The substeps do not contradict the idea that the shed should be open.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be an additional step or substep that reinforces the idea that the shed should be open.
  The only choice that does that is A, which says to leave the door open for the barn owls to fly in, but also to consider bringing a pair of wooden wading poles to keep out other animals that might not have wings.
  Therefore, the answer is A: They can climb in, if they do not have wings or owls need air. Consider bringing a pair of wooden wading poles to keep them out.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

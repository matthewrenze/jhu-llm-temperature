Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  The fire described is already burning brightly.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is a description of how people are interacting with the fire.
  Choice A describes people watching the fire dance, which is a common activity around a campfire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  A campfire is a fire that is lit outdoors for warmth, cooking, and entertainment purposes.
  The sentence "A campfire burns brightly in the night" implies that the fire is already lit and burning.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that we are continuing to describe the campfire.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is large and visible.
  The phrase "dances" suggests that the fire is flickering and moving.
  The phrase "people watch it flame" suggests that the fire is a source of entertainment.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly at night.
  The second sentence needs to provide a logical and safe continuation to the story.
  Choice A describes people watching the fire, but it does not provide any information about what happens to the fire.
  Choice B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is a logical continuation to the story.
  Choice C describes a specific method for lighting and putting out a fire, but it is not necessary information for completing the story.
  Choice D describes a fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is dangerous and not a logical continuation to the story.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The first sentence mentions a campfire already burning brightly.
  The second sentence should logically follow from the first sentence.
  The second sentence mentions the fire growing in size, which makes sense.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is B: slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe something happening to the fire.
  Option A is the most likely completion because it describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B could be a possible completion, but it is not as likely as option A.
  Option C and D are unlikely completions because they do not describe the fire burning brightly or anything happening to the fire.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  A campfire is typically a contained fire that is started for warmth, cooking, or as a social gathering point.
  The text suggests that the campfire is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens next.
  Option A is the most likely completion as it suggests that people are watching the fire burn and the flames are dancing.
  Option B could be a possibility, but it doesn't make as much sense as option A.
  Option C doesn't fit the context of the text.
  Option D is unlikely since it suggests the fire is out of control.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  A camp fire that burns brightly in the night means that the fire is already going.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is describing what the fire is doing.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is possible.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also possible.
  Option C describes how the fire was started and how it will be put out, but it does not describe what the fire is currently doing.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is unlikely and dangerous.
  Therefore, the best answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
   The preceding sentence suggests that the fire is already burning.
   The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already large.
   The next sentence should describe what the fire is doing.
   Option A describes the fire dancing which is a common description of flames.
   Option B contradicts the preceding sentence.
   Option C describes a process of lighting a fire and putting it out, not what the fire is currently doing.
   Option D is not likely as it suggests the fire is out of control.
   Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  A campfire that "burns brightly in the night" implies a fire that has already been started.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that we are describing this fire that has already been started.
  Option A is a likely completion because it describes the flames moving in a way that could be described as dancing.
  Option B is not a likely completion because it contradicts the initial phrase "burns brightly in the night." Slowly growing in size implies a dimmer fire.
  Option C is not a likely completion because it describes a specific method for starting and putting out a fire, which is not relevant to the initial phrase.
  Option D is not a likely completion because it describes a dangerous situation where the fire is spreading uncontrollably.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" implies that the fire is already at its peak.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the fire is slowly growing in size or rapidly spreading across the ground.
  The word "dances" in choice A is a common way to describe the movement of flames in a fire.
  The phrase "put out behind an iron grill" in choice C does not make sense in the context of the sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is choice A: "dances and people watch it flame."

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  It is not mentioned that the player has already hit the goal or missed it.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which indicates that the player is about to do something with his teammate.
  The only option that makes sense is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team tries to hit a goal, which means he is trying to score.
  The text mentions "his team member", so it's likely that the blue team player passes the ball to his teammate.
  The other choices do not make sense in the context of the text.
  Therefore, the answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which implies that the player from the blue team is passing the ball to his teammate.
  Option A describes a teammate scoring a goal, which is the most likely completion of the text.
  Option B describes the player missing the goal by two feet, which is not a completion of the text.
  Option C describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is not a completion of the text.
  Option D describes the player failing the first time and being called a loser, which is not a completion of the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The first part of the sentence describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The second part of the sentence starts with the phrase "his team member".
  The most likely completion to the sentence would describe what the team member does with the ball.
  Option A describes a successful pass and a goal, but it includes the phrase "the sumo", which seems out of place.
  Option B describes the player missing the goal by two feet, but it does not mention what the team member does.
  Option C describes the team member trying to follow and keep the ball away from the opponent team player, which fits with the context.
  Option D describes the player failing and being called a loser, which seems too negative and unlikely.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text describes a player from the blue team who is trying to hit a goal with his lacrosse stick.
  The player's team member is introduced as the next event in the narrative.
  The most likely completion should be consistent with the narrative.
  Option A introduces a new character, "the sumo," who has not been mentioned before. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Option B describes the player spinning to evade the ball and missing the goal by two feet, which is inconsistent with the player's initial aggressive behavior. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Option D describes the player failing and being called a loser, which is inappropriate and inconsistent with the spirit of the game. Therefore, it is unlikely to be the correct answer.
  Option C is consistent with the player's initial behavior of chasing the ball and trying to keep it away from the opponent team player. Therefore, it is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member".
  It is most likely that the team member will do something related to the ball or the goal.
  Option A is unlikely because it mentions a sumo making a goal and the blue team coming out of their seats, which is not related to the context.
  Option B is unlikely because it mentions the player missing the goal by two feet, which contradicts the first sentence that says the player was aggressively chasing the ball and trying to hit the goal.
  Option D is unlikely because it mentions the player failing the first time and being called a loser, which is not a positive or realistic outcome.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it mentions the team member trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is related to the context and makes sense.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The text then mentions "his team member".
  It is likely that the player's team member is involved in the next action.
  Option A is unlikely because it mentions a "sumo" making a goal, which is not related to the story.
  Option B is unlikely because it mentions the player missing the goal by two feet, which contradicts the previous sentence.
  Option D is inappropriate as it mentions the player being called a loser, which is disrespectful and not helpful.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it suggests that the player tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a logical action in a lacrosse game.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes the player's action of chasing the ball and trying to hit a goal.
  The second sentence starts with "his team member", indicating that the action of the player is related to the action of his teammate.
  Option A describes a successful pass and goal, which seems plausible.
  Option B describes the player missing the goal, but doesn't mention anything about his teammate, so it's less likely.
  Option C describes the player trying to keep the ball away from the opponent, which is a valid strategy but doesn't involve his teammate.
  Option D is unlikely because it's unlikely that a player would be called a loser for failing once.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player "passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  It is likely that the player's teammate will do something related to this play.
  Option A describes a successful play, but it includes a confusing phrase "the sumo".
  Option B describes the player spinning and missing the goal, which is possible, but it doesn't involve the teammate.
  Option D is inappropriate and unlikely.
  Option C describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a reasonable expectation.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The text describes him picking up weights and lifting them over his head.
  Sometimes, he fails to lift the weight, other times he is successful.
  None of the choices mention him being successful or failing.
  Choice A doesn't seem logical because if he lifted the weight so far, he would not be dragged to the ground.
  Choice B doesn't seem to fit the context because the text mentions his friends recording him.
  Choice C seems illogical because it goes against the description of him lifting the weight over his head.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: The text describes a man training for weightlifting events in the Olympics. He lifts weights over his head several times. The text mentions that "sometimes he" which implies that the sentence is incomplete and we need to find the most likely completion of the sentence. The options are:
  A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
  B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
  C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
  D: fails, other times he is successful.
Option A is unlikely because it is not safe to lift weights that are too heavy to the point of being dragged to the ground. Option B is unlikely because it contradicts the earlier statement that the man lifts the weight over his head several times. Option C does not make sense as it describes the opposite action of lifting weights. Option D is the most likely completion of the sentence as it suggests that the man has some successful and some unsuccessful attempts in lifting the weight over his head.
Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  He lifts the weight over his head several times.
  The options are not very clear, but it seems that option A and B do not make sense in the context of the text.

  Option D seems to be the most likely answer because the text mentions that sometimes he fails while other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weight over his head several times.

  The options "lifts so far he is dragged to the ground," "puts it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it," and "lowers his arms and his hands up" are unlikely to be the correct answer as they don't fit with the description of weightlifting.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The title is "How to ripen a cantaloupe", so it makes sense to provide information on how to determine if a cantaloupe is ripe.
  Option A is incorrect because placing a cantaloupe on its side does not produce ripeness.
  Option B is incorrect because it talks about dark spots but the text does not mention anything about dark spots.

  D: are seen on the bank watching a calf as it is released.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The options A, B, and D do not relate to the description of the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  Option C seems to be the most likely completion as it describes others kneeling around him as he continues to reel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text also mentions "others" which implies that there are other people present.
  The most likely scenario is that these people are helping the person reel in the fish.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "C: kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text mentions "others" which implies that there are more people involved.
  Option A is unlikely because the text does not mention the capture of any fish.
  Option B seems unlikely because it describes people being off in the water, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option D is unlikely because it talks about watching a calf, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option C seems likely because it describes people kneeling around the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "others kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The following sentence should describe what others are doing.
  Since the person is reeling in the pole, others are most likely helping him/her or watching.
  Option C describes others kneeling around him/her, which makes the most sense.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole. 
  The text suggests that there are other people around the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  The only choice that makes sense is C, where other people are kneeling around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The remaining sentence should describe what others are doing.
  Option A does not make sense because it says "capturing the fish that he has captured."
  Option B does not make sense because it says "mostly off in the water" which is unclear.
  Option D does not make sense because it talks about watching a calf, which is not related to fishing.
  Option C makes sense because it says "kneel around him as he continues to reel", which is related to fishing and describes what others are doing.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text also mentions "others" which implies the presence of more people.
  Option A mentions "capturing the fish that he has captured in the area", which is redundant and does not make sense.
  Option B talks about people being "mostly off in the water" which is unlikely because they would be ice fishing.
  Option D talks about watching a calf, which is not relevant to ice fishing.
  Option C mentions "kneel around him as he continues to reel", which is likely because they would be helping him reel in the fish.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "others kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text also mentions "others".
  The most likely scenario is that these "others" are helping the person reel in the fish.
  Choice A seems possible but is too specific.
  Choice B does not make sense as it describes others being in the water.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the text.
  Choice C is the most likely completion as it describes others kneeling around the person as he reels in the fish.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The next sentence should describe what others are doing.
  Option A is unlikely because it says that others are capturing the fish that he has already captured, but the text only describes the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  Option B is also unlikely because it says that others are mostly off in the water followed by more people reeling the fishing pole in, which doesn't make sense because everyone can't be in the water reeling the fishing pole in.
  Option D is also unlikely because it talks about others watching a calf being released, which has nothing to do with the fishing pole.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it describes others kneeling around him as he continues to reel, which is a reasonable scenario when ice fishing.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole with a person reeling it in.
  The choices describe what is likely to be shown in the rest of the scene.
  Choice A describes others capturing fish in the area, but the text only describes one person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Choice B describes people mostly off in the water, which is unlikely since they are fishing with a pole.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
One of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him. then he
Choices:
  A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
  B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
  C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall.
  D: runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting the weight bar several times and then dropping it down.
  The next sentence should describe what the bodybuilder does after dropping the weight bar.
  Since the text does not mention any injury or accident, it is safe to assume that the bodybuilder will lift the weight bar again.
  This is confirmed by the phrase "lifts the weight bar again" in option A.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down while two other bodybuilders watch him.
  The sentence that follows "then he" is a continuation of the action.
  Option A describes the bodybuilder wiping off his sweat and lifting the weight bar again, which is possible, but it is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B describes the bodybuilder releasing the weight bar and the beam he was holding, but there is no mention of a beam in the original text.
  Option C describes the bodybuilder lifting for a few more seconds and then dropping the weight bar, causing the other bodybuilders to fall, but this is not mentioned in the original text.
  Option D describes the bodybuilder running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down, but this is not mentioned in the original text.
  Therefore, none of the options fit the context of the text.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text states that one body builder lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him.
  The text then asks what he does next.
  Option A mentions wiping off his sweat with a towel, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option C mentions the body builders falling, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option D mentions the body builders falling and the lifter dropping down, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B mentions releasing the weight bar and a beam, which is not mentioned in the text.
  None of the options seem to be an accurate completion of the text.
  However, the most likely completion of the text is the lifter possibly resting for a moment before attempting another lift.
  Therefore, I will select the closest answer, which is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a body builder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it while the other two body builders watch him.
  The sentence begins with "then he," which suggests that the next action is related to what the body builder just did.
  Option A suggests the body builder wipes off his sweat with a towel, lifts the weight bar again and drops it. There is no indication that the body builder wiped off his sweat in the original text.
  Option B suggests the body builder releases the weight bar and a beam he was holding and drops them down near the floor. There is no mention of a beam in the original text.
  Option C suggests the body builder continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall. This does not make sense as it suggests the body builders fall, which is not mentioned in the original text.
  Option D suggests the body builder runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down. This is not related to the original text and does not make sense.
  Therefore, none of the options are likely to be correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting the weight bar several times and then dropping it down while two other bodybuilders watch him.
  The word "then" indicates that the next sentence will describe what happens next.
  The word "he" indicates that the next sentence will describe what the bodybuilder does.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the bodybuilder does something related to lifting the weight bar again.
  Therefore, the answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
The text describes a bodybuilder lifting the weight bar several times and then dropping it down while others watch him.
Option A describes the bodybuilder wiping off his sweat and lifting the weight again.
Option B describes the bodybuilder releasing the weight bar and the beam he was holding and dropping it down near the floor.
Option C describes the bodybuilder continuing to lift for a couple of seconds and then dropping it while the bodybuilders fall.
Option D is not related to the text and does not make sense.
The most likely completion to the text is option B, where the bodybuilder releases the weight bar and the beam he was holding and drops it down near the floor.
Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the body builder lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it.
  This means that the body builder is performing a weightlifting exercise called the clean and jerk.
  The text does not mention anything about the body builder wiping off sweat or dropping any additional equipment.
  The text also does not mention the body builders falling or the weight bar falling on anyone.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is that the body builder releases the weight bar.
  The answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text describes a body builder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it.
  The text indicates that the other two body builders are watching him.
  Based on this information, it is most likely that the body builder will perform the clean and jerk weightlifting technique.
  After completing the lift, the body builder will drop the weight bar.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the body builder will perform the clean and jerk technique, and then drop the weight bar.
  The answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it while being watched by two other bodybuilders.
  The next sentence should describe what he does next.
  Option A says he wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it, but there is no mention of him wiping off his sweat or lifting the weight bar again.
  Option B says he releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor. This seems plausible since the text mentions that he dropped the weight bar.
  Option C says he continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the bodybuilders fall. This seems unlikely since there is no mention of the body builders attempting to lift or falling.
  Option D says he runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down. This seems unlikely since there is no mention of the body builders falling or him dropping down.
  Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")

  The text describes a girl running down a track and taking a huge jump over a bar.
  The most logical completion to the text would be to describe the girl's landing.
  Option A suggests that she lands on a mat, marking her dark score, but it is unclear what "dark score" means in this context.
  Option B suggests that she is shown performing the act again in slow motion, but this does not describe her landing.
  Option C suggests that she lands on the grass with her arms outstretched, but it is unclear if there is grass around the high jump mat.
  Option D suggests that she lands on a mat behind her, which is the most logical completion to the text as high jumpers typically land on a mat behind the bar.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The girl takes a huge jump, hurling herself over a bar.
  The completion should describe what happens after she completes the jump.
  Option A says she lands on a mat and marks her dark score. This seems unlikely as high jumpers don't usually land on a mat.
  Option B says she performs the act again in slow motion. This could be a possibility, but it doesn't describe what happens after the jump.
  Option C says she lands on the grass with her arms outstretched. This is also unlikely because high jumpers usually land on the mat.
  Option D says she lands on a mat behind her. This seems like the most likely completion because high jumpers usually land on the mat.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar, which is likely to be a high jump bar.
  The description does not suggest that the girl falls on the ground.
  Therefore, she must land on something that is soft and can absorb the impact of her jump.
  Option A mentions a mat, which is commonly used in high jump competitions to cushion the athlete's landing.
  Therefore, the answer is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")

  Option B suggests that the girl performs the act again in slow motion, which is possible, but not the most likely completion.
  Option C suggests that the girl lands on the grass with her arms outstretched, which is not a common landing position for a high jump.

  The most likely completion to the text is something that would happen after the girl takes the jump.
  Option A mentions a "dark score", but it is unclear what that means in the context of high jump.
  Option B suggests that the act is repeated, but it is unclear why or what is gained from repeating it.
  Option C suggests that the girl lands on the grass, but high jump competitions usually have a mat or pit for landing.
  Option D mentions a mat, which is consistent with high jump competitions.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the girl lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")

  The title "Keep your shed open to the wild" suggests that the barn owls will be attracted to a natural environment.
  The step "Clear everything out and give it a bit of a dust" indicates that the barn should be clean and free of debris.
  The substep "Make sure you leave the door open for the barn owls" reinforces the idea that the barn should be open.
  Option A is unlikely because owls have wings and can fly.
  Option B is unlikely because it does not match with the text and makes little sense.
  Option C is possible, but it does not match with the text because it suggests building a bird box, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option D is unlikely because it suggests using an owl-repellent, which is the opposite of what the text is trying to achieve.

[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Thought: 
  The passage is discussing how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  One important consideration when setting expectations is to make sure they are age appropriate.
  The passage notes that children develop at their own pace, but there are general developmental milestones that can serve as a guideline.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The text talks about setting expectations for your children's behavior in public.
It advises to ensure that expectations are age-appropriate.
It also mentions that children develop at their own pace, and while there are milestones to provide guidance, they are not a guarantee.
It does not mention that you should tell your child that s/he had no manners in early childhood or any such example.
Option A and B are not relevant to the context.
Option D provides some information about children in adolescence, but it's not directly related to setting expectations for children's behavior in public.
The most relevant step is option C, which advises doing research to learn about developmental milestones, keeping in mind the age of the child and their typical behaviors, and evaluating whether expectations are realistic before going out in public.
Therefore, the answer is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.

Topic: Starting a campfire
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A camp fire burns brightly in the night. the fire
Choices:
  A: dances and people watch it flame.
  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a campfire that is already burning.
  The subsequent sentence describes how the fire behaves.
  The word "brightly" gives us a clue that the fire is probably not small.
  Choice A describes people watching the fire, which is plausible.
  Choice B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also plausible.
  Choice C describes lighting the fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill, which is less plausible given the information in the question.
  Choice D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not consistent with a controlled campfire.
  Therefore, the most plausible completion to the text is A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The first sentence states that "A camp fire burns brightly in the night."
  The second sentence should follow on from the first one and explain what is happening to the fire.
  Option A seems like a logical completion to the sentence as it describes the fire's movement.
  Option B seems unlikely because the fire is already burning brightly and would not slowly grow in size.
  Option C may be a possibility but it is more specific than is necessary for the sentence.
  Option D is unlikely because a spreading fire is not a desirable outcome.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night. 
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the completion will involve lighting or starting the fire.
  Choice A seems plausible as campfires often appear to "dance" due to the flickering of the flames, and people enjoy watching them.
  Choice B is possible, but there is no indication that the fire is growing or getting bigger in the text.
  Choice C does not make sense because the fire is already burning brightly, so it cannot be lighted from the inside up.
  Choice D is unlikely because a campfire that rapidly spreads across the ground is dangerous and not what one would want when starting a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should provide more details about the fire.
  "Dances and people watch it flame" seems like a reasonable completion.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  A campfire is usually started with small pieces of dry wood and some kindling.
  Once the fire is going, it will burn brightly in the night.
  The choices A and D are unlikely, as a campfire should not be spreading across the ground or dancing wildly.
  Choice C is also unlikely, as putting out a campfire behind an iron grill is an unusual method.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is B: slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes an already started campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The options are describing what happens next to the campfire.
  Option A seems the most appropriate because it describes the movement of the flames and people observing it.
  Option B is unlikely because it implies the fire is not already burning brightly.
  Option C seems to be describing the process of starting a campfire, not what happens to an already burning fire.
  Option D is unlikely because it describes a dangerous situation where the fire is spreading rapidly.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first sentence suggests that the campfire is already burning brightly.
  The second sentence describes the feature of the fire.
  The feature is that it slowly grows in size.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: slowly grows in size.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text describes the campfire as burning brightly in the night.
  The descriptions 'dances and people watch it flame' and 'slowly grows in size' both suggest a calm and stable fire which is consistent with the peaceful tone of the text.
  The description 'rapidly spreads across the ground' is not consistent with the peaceful tone of the text and would be a dangerous situation for a campfire.
  The description 'is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill' is more likely a description of a charcoal barbecue than a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: The first sentence describes a scene where a campfire is already burning brightly in the night. The next sentence should describe what happens after. 
  A: This is possible, but it doesn't accurately describe what happens to an already burning campfire.
  B: This could be a possible option, since we know the fire is burning brightly, it would make sense that it has grown in size over time. 
  C: This could be a possible option, but it seems to be more of a description of how to safely light and put out a campfire rather than a continuation of the first sentence.
  D: This is unlikely, since a rapidly spreading fire would likely cause danger and wouldn't be described as burning brightly in a positive way.
  From the given options, B is the most likely completion to the sentence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Option A seems to be the most appropriate as it describes the fire "dancing" and people watching it flame.
  Option B may be a possibility, but it does not add much information.
  Option C describes a specific way to light and put out a fire, but it does not continue the description of the fire burning in the night.
  Option D is unlikely as it describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not safe or desirable.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.

  B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
  D: better mark the match while they're still scoring.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  The yellow team also shakes hands briefly with each other and claps their backs in celebratory response.
  Therefore, it is likely that the yellow team won the game and scored one final goal.
  The most likely completion to the text is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response. 
  This usually happens when a team scores a goal and increases the lead or wins the game.
  The options C and D are not likely to be a completion of the text as they do not describe any response of the yellow team to the goal they earn.
  Option A is also not likely as the text says that the yellow team celebrates after earning another goal.
  The option that best fits is B as it describes an event that usually happens when a team scores a goal and wins the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text says the yellow team earns another goal.
  It also says they shake hands briefly and clap each other's backs in celebratory response.
  This suggests the game is not yet over.
  The most likely completion would be a description of what happens next in the game.
  The only option that describes what happens next is option B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates by briefly shaking hands and clapping their backs.
  This suggests that the game is still ongoing.
  The completion should provide information on what happens after the yellow team earns another goal.
  Option A suggests that the yellow team loses one goal and walks away, which does not make sense.
  Option B suggests that the yellow team scores one final goal and hugs each other, which seems like a likely completion.
  Option C suggests that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth, which does not provide any additional information.
  Option D seems unrelated to what is happening in the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The text describes the yellow team scoring a goal and celebrating briefly by clapping each other's backs.
The phrase "scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response" describes another possible celebratory response by the yellow team after scoring one final goal.
Option C describes the yellow team continuing to play and score goals but does not mention any further celebration.
Option D does not make sense in the context of the text.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: The text describes the yellow team scoring another goal. They celebrate briefly with each other. Therefore, it is likely that the game is not over yet and that the yellow team continues playing. So, the most likely completion is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response. The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text suggests that the yellow team has already scored a goal and is celebrating.
  The text indicates that the yellow team is completing a brief celebratory act.
  The phrase "scores one final goal" seems like a likely completion to the text as it would make sense that the yellow team would hug each other in response to this final goal.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The yellow team had previously scored a goal and now they are earning another goal.
  After earning the second goal, they celebrate by shaking hands and clapping their backs in a celebratory response.
  The most likely completion is a statement that describes what happens next.
  Option A doesn't fit the context since they just scored another goal.
  Option B seems likely since they've already celebrated twice after scoring goals.
  Option C doesn't fit the context since they are not doing the same thing back and forth.
  Option D doesn't fit the context of the situation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text says that the yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response.
  This shows that the yellow team is jubilant after scoring another goal.
  The yellow team hugging each other in response to scoring one final goal seems like the most likely completion to the text.
  The other options do not fit with the celebratory response described by the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earned another goal.
  They shook hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response.
  This indicates that the game is not over yet.
  The yellow team members hug each other in response when they score the final goal.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that the woman is braiding her hair.
  The other options do not seem to complete the sentence in a logical or grammatically correct way.
  Option A has some details that do not make sense, such as "bryls" and "front kick".
  Option C mentions a "knotted hair area" that is not mentioned in the original text.
  Option D does not seem to fit the context of the original text.
  Option B could be a possibility, but it does not provide any information on what happens after the woman shows the braid.
  Therefore, the best completion to the sentence is option B: ", the woman shows the braid while continues talking."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the woman takes a lock of front hair and braids it by taking hair from the sides.
  The text does not mention any other actions related to the braid.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman shows the braid while continuing to talk.
  The answer is B: ", the woman shows the braid while continues talking."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes how a woman braids her hair.
  The sentence before the blank describes how the woman takes a lock of front hair and braids it.
  The options A and C do not seem to fit the context as they include instructions that are not previously mentioned, such as "bryls the hair," "finishes braiding with a pin," "put the braids with a large clip," and "close the flipped hair."
  Option B does not provide an action that follows braiding the hair.
  Option D seems to describe the woman supervising the braiding process, which is not mentioned in the previous text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is the woman shows the braid while continuing talking.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes how a woman is braiding her hair.
  Based on the previous sentence, the woman has already taken a lock of her front hair and has started braiding.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the woman finishes braiding her hair.
  Choice A gives a detailed description of how the woman finishes braiding her hair.
  Choices B, C, and D do not provide a logical completion to the previous sentence.
  Therefore, the answer is A: , the woman bryls the hair to the back side of her head, next she finishes braiding with a pin in front kick her hair over the parts of her shoulders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a woman lying on a bed and braiding her hair.
  The sentence ends with "then", implying that the following sentence should describe a continuation of the hair braiding process.
  Choice C does not make sense as there is no mention of any knotted hair area or a large clip in the passage.
  Choice D is incorrect as it presents a grammatically incorrect sentence.
  Choice A presents a detailed and logical step-by-step process of finishing the hair braid and moving the braided hair to the front of her shoulders.
  Choice B does not make sense with the context of the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is A: ', the woman bryls the hair to the back side of her head, next she finishes braiding with a pin in front kick her hair over the parts of her shoulders.'.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes a woman brushing her hair on the bed and then braiding it.
  The next sentence must describe what the woman does after taking a lock of front hair and braiding it.
  Choice A describes the woman "bryling" her hair and then finishing the braid with a pin in front, which does not make sense in the context of the passage.
  Choice B describes the woman showing off her braid while continuing to talk, which is not related to what the woman does after braiding her hair.
  Choice C mentions a knotted hair area, large clip, and flipped hair, which are not mentioned in the previous sentences.
  Choice D suggests that the woman braids the ends with instructions and supervision, which is not mentioned in the passage.
  None of the choices seem to make sense as a completion to the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence "Then" suggests that we need to complete the sequence of actions.
  The woman has already brushed her hair and taken a lock of front hair to braid taking hair from sides.
  The correct option should describe the next action in the sequence of braiding hair.
  Option A appears to be talking about something else, not related to braiding hair.
  Option C seems to be mentioning a knotted hair area, which is not relevant to the context.
  Option D seems to be talking about supervising the braid, but it is unclear who is supervising.
  Option B is the most likely completion as it suggests that the woman shows the braid while continuing to talk.
Therefore, the answer is B: , the woman shows the braid while continues talking.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The woman has already taken a lock of front hair and started braiding.
  The sentence that follows should continue the description of what the woman does next.
  Option A describes the woman bryling her hair, which is not mentioned before and seems not to fit the context.
  Option C starts about knotted hair, which is also not mentioned before.
  Option D talks about instruction and supervision which is not mentioned before.
  Option B is the only one that makes sense because it says she shows the braid while continuing talking, and it is possible that she was doing her hair while talking to someone.
  The answer is B: , the woman shows the braid while continues talking.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a woman lying on a bed and brushing her hair before braiding it.
  The text further describes the woman taking a lock of front hair and braiding it while taking hair from the sides.
  The text ends abruptly with the word "then" and a continuation is required.
  None of the options appear to be a logical continuation of the text.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The sentence before the blank describes the woman brushing her hair and taking a lock of front hair to braid.
  The blank seems to be a continuation of the sequence of steps the woman is taking to braid her hair.
  Choice A describes the woman "bryling" (unclear what this means) the hair to the back side of her head and finishing the braid with a pin in front, which doesn't seem like a likely next step.
  Choice B describes the woman showing the braid while continuing to talk, which doesn't fit with the context of the previous sentence.
  Choice C describes the woman starting with a knotted hair area and putting the braids with a large clip, which also doesn't seem like a likely next step.
  Choice D describes the woman braiding the ends with instructions and supervision, which doesn't make sense as there is no mention of someone else being involved in the process.
  Therefore, none of the choices seem like the most likely completion to the text.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  D: They are not differentiated from hair that is entirely corn. [substeps] High protein foods should be added to your diet to ensure optimal hair-growth.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  The text in choice B mentions that the whites of a dog's eyes may look different when the dog is afraid, which is consistent with the first step in the text.
  The text in choice C talks about pupils dilating, which is not mentioned in the first step, so it is not a likely completion for the text.
  The text in choice D repeats the information in the first step and provides additional information about dilated pupils, which is consistent with the behavior of widening the eyes.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  The text goes on to explain that dogs who are tense or fearful may widen their eyes.
  The text also states that relaxed dogs often squint so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
  The most likely completion to the text that explains more characteristics of dogs that are tense or fearful is D.
  Choice A seems to be talking about other characteristics of dogs but these are not necessarily related to fear.
  Choice B talks about the whites of a dog's eyes but it does not seem to be related to fear in dogs.
  Choice C mentions another characteristic of dogs but it is about their pupils and not necessarily related to fear.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  The next step should be related to identifying the signs of overwatering.
  Option A talks about a rusty color and a small dent in the stem or subject, which does not seem to be a common sign of overwatering. The substeps also do not make sense as they talk about removing the plant from shade when the sun drops below the mulch.
  Option B talks about allowing the seedlings' roots to dry out, which is not in line with the topic. It also mentions waiting for the plant to dry completely before watering, which is not useful when the plant is already overwatered.
  Option C talks about the color decreasing in sunlight, which seems to be an unusual symptom of overwatering. The substeps also do not make sense and are not related to saving an overwatered plant.
  Option D talks about the leaves being light green or yellowed, which is a common sign of overwatering. It also mentions that the new growth being brown instead of green is a similar sign. This matches the topic and seems to be the correct completion of the text.

  D: fails the first time and he is called a loser.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is trying to score a goal with his lacrosse stick.
  The next action of his team member will most likely be related to this play.
  Option A talks about a sumo making a goal, which is not related to the play described in the question.
  Option B talks about the player missing the goal by two feet, which contradicts the description of him aggressively chasing the ball.
  Option D describes an outcome that is unlikely and also contradicts the description of the player's aggressive play.
  Option C, on the other hand, describes a likely continuation of the play where the team member tries to keep the ball away from the opponent team player.
  Therefore, the best answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text mentions that "a player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal".
  The player is trying to score a goal, so it makes sense that the next sentence would be about what happens regarding the goal.
  Option A is unlikely because it mentions a sumo, which is not relevant to the situation.
  Option B is unlikely because it suggests that the player missed the goal.
  Option D is incorrect because it includes negative language and is inappropriate.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it suggests that the player is trying to keep the ball away from the opponent team, which is a common strategy in lacrosse.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text states that a player from the blue team chases the ball and tries to hit a goal.
  The player's team member would most likely help the player who has the ball.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the team member tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  The answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The player is chasing the ball aggressively.
  The player tries to hit a goal with his lacrosse stick.
  The pronoun "his" refers to a teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the teammate passes to another teammate, who then makes a goal, and the blue team comes out of their seats.
  The answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the ball or the player with the ball or what the other team does.
  Option A is not likely because it mentions a sumo making a goal.
  Option B is not likely because it mentions the player spinning to evade the ball when the player is trying to hit the ball.
  Option D is not likely because it mentions the player being called a loser, which is not a sportsmanlike behavior.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it mentions the player continuing to follow the ball and trying to keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a player trying to hit a goal, which implies the player is in the offensive side of the field. 
  The text also mentions "his" team member, indicating that the player is a male. 
  None of the choices accurately relate to the situation.
  Since there is no accurate answer, the most likely answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  From the text, we know that a player from the blue team is chasing the ball aggressively with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal. 
  Then, the incomplete sentence mentions "his team member", which indicates that the player is passing the ball to his teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is that "his team member passes the ball to another teammate" to continue the play towards scoring a goal.
  The answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that the player chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal. This means he is trying to score.
  The sentence also mentions "his team member" which means that another player from the blue team is involved.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to this text is that the team member:
  passes to another teammate to help the blue team score a goal.
  Choice A is the only option that suggests a goal is scored by the blue team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The player is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick to hit a goal. This means he is trying to score.
  The phrase "his team member" suggests that the player is going to pass the ball to someone else on his team.
  Option A describes a successful pass and goal.
  Option B describes a missed attempt.
  Option C describes the player trying to keep the ball away from the opponent team player.
  Option D is not a likely completion to the text.
  Therefore, the answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team who is aggressively chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The text then introduces the player's "team member", indicating that the player's teammate is relevant to the story.
  It is unlikely that the completion of the story would involve the blue team scoring a goal, because the text does not mention the sumo at any other point.
  It is also unlikely that the story would involve the blue team player missing the goal, because the text describes the player as "aggressively" chasing the ball.
  It is possible that the story would involve the blue team player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, as this would be a logical next step in the game.
  It is not likely that the story would involve the player failing and being called a loser, as this would be a negative and unlikely outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

  The text already lists two steps, flossing and brushing teeth, and showering.
  The next step is about washing hair and face in the shower.
  The missing step is likely about washing the body.

  The description mentions a marching band in red uniforms playing drums and performing a choreography on the street.
  Behind the band, there are kids walking in circles, also performing a choreography.
  None of the choices seem to fit the scene described.
  However, "show side by side shaking their hands" might be the closest option to what is being described, as it suggests the kids are also doing some sort of synchronized movement.
  Therefore, the answer is A: show side by side shaking their hands.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and is playing drums.
  The marching band is also doing a choreography in the street.
  There are kids walking in circles behind the band.
  The prompt is asking for the most likely completion.
  Answer A, B, C, or D may complete the prompt.
  Answer A and C sound more likely to complete the prompt.
  Answer B talks about kids walking down to the stage, but the prompt does not mention anything about a stage.
  Answer D talks about kids wandering around, but the prompt says the kids are walking in circles.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the prompt is that the kids show side by side shaking their hands.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text talks about a marching band wearing red uniforms, playing drums and doing a choreography.
  Behind the band, there are kids walking in circles doing a choreography.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is that the kids are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The marching band is wearing red uniforms, playing drums, and doing a choreography on the street.
Behind them, kids are walking in circles and doing a choreography.
Given the context, it is unlikely that the kids are sitting on the sidewalk or wandering around.
Option A does not make sense given the context.
Option B is a bit confusing and does not align with the context of the marching band and kids on the street.
Option C is a possibility, but it is not guaranteed.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the kids are walking down to the stage holding handstands on the stairs and just standing around.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and is playing drums.
  They are also doing choreography while they play their drums.
  Behind the band, kids are walking in circles and doing a choreography.
  The text is describing a marching band, so it is most likely that the kids are performing a choreography that is related to the band's performance.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the kids are performing a choreography that is related to the band's performance.
  The answer is A: show side by side shaking their hands.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and playing drums while doing a choreography.
  Behind the marching band, kids are walking in circles and doing a choreography.
  The text is describing a drum corps performance where the band is playing, and the color guard is dancing in the background.
  The description mentions nothing about the kids interacting with the band or the color guard.
  Therefore, "kids are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them" is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes a marching band in red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography.
  Behind the band, the text describes kids walking in circles and doing a choreography.
  None of the choices seem to accurately complete the text.
  However, choice A is the most coherent and makes the most sense, as it describes the kids next to the marching band showing a choreography alongside the band.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a marching band in red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography in the street.
  Behind the band, a group of kids walking in circles are doing a choreography.
  None of the choices seem to fit the context well except for choice C. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Context suggests that there is a marching band in red uniforms playing drums, and there are kids walking in circles doing a choreography behind the band.
  Option A, "show side by side shaking their hands" seems unlikely.
  Option B, "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around" is unclear and does not make sense in the context.
  Option C, "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them" is a possibility.
  Option D, "wandering around in the street around him walking around" is unlikely.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The description mentions a marching band in red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography. 
  Then, there are kids who are walking in circles doing a choreography. 
  It is not likely that they show side by side shaking their hands.
  It is not likely that the kids are wandering around in the street. 
  It is not likely that the kids are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them.
  The most logical completion of the text is that the kids are walking down to the stage holding handstands on the stairs and just standing around.

Choices:
  A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
  B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
  C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
  D: fails, other times he is successful.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text mentions that the man is training for the weightlifting events in the olympics.
  The man is shown picking up weights and lifting them over his head several times.
  The text then mentions that sometimes he fails and other times he is successful.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the next sentence will be "sometimes he fails, other times he is successful."
  The answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Based on the context, it seems like the man is showing off his weightlifting skills.
  The video shows him lifting weights several times.
  The choices are:
    A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
    B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
    C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
    D: fails, other times he is successful.
  Choice A is unlikely since it doesn't seem feasible for the man to lift himself off the ground.
  Choice B could be possible but it doesn't make much sense since he's already lifting it over his head.
  Choice C doesn't make much sense either.
  Choice D is the most likely answer since the man is training and sometimes he succeeds while other times he fails.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weights and lifts them over his head.
  The text mentions "several times" he does this.
  The following phrase "sometimes he" suggests that the text is about his successes and failures in lifting weights.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text talks about a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics and several times he lifts the weight over his head.
  The text doesn't suggest that the man is reckless and would be dragged to the ground.
  The text also doesn't suggest that the man is putting the weight down to raise it above his head.
  The text doesn't imply that the man is lowering his arms and hands up.
  The text suggests that the man is trying, sometimes failing, and sometimes being successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The man in the video is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts the weight over his head several times in the video.
  The text ends with the word "sometimes he".
  None of the choices is contradictory to the information provided in the text.
  The most likely completion of the text is that "sometimes he fails, other times he is successful."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The man is training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He is picking up weight and lifting it over his head several times.
  The text mentions that he fails other times he is successful.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man picks up weights and lifts them over his head.
  The text also mentions that the man "sometimes" lifts the weights successfully.
  Since the text says that the man lifts the weights up, but does not mention him being dragged to the ground or lowering his arms, choices A and C are unlikely.
  The text also mentions that the man's friends were recording him.
  Choice B seems plausible, but there is no indication in the text that the man put the weight down before lifting it again.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "sometimes he fails, other times he is successful." 
  The answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The man is training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  The options that describe him picking up weight and lifting it over his head are B and D.
  Option A describes him lifting so far that he is dragged to the ground, which is highly unlikely.
  Option C describes him lowering his arms and his hands up, which doesn't make sense.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weights and lifts them over his head several times.
  The sentence started with "sometimes he", which means there's a variation in his performance. 
  "Lifts so far he is dragged to the ground" seems like an unlikely scenario.
  "Put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it" doesn't make sense since he's already lifting weights in the video.
  "Lowers his arms and his hands up" doesn't fit with the context of the man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  "Fails, other times he is successful" seems like a possible scenario since weightlifting is difficult and requires practice.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events.
  The first sentence states that he lifts weight over his head several times.
  The choices are possible outcomes of the weightlifting attempts.
  The video shows the man's attempts at the weightlifting event.

[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text is about how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  One step mentioned is to never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green.
  Another step mentioned is that once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, it is probably ripe.
  The question asks for the most likely completion to the text.
  The text does not mention placing the cantaloupe in a container or on its side as a method of ripening. So, A is not the answer.
  B talks about dark spots, blackheads, and splotchy look which are not mentioned in the text. So, B is not the answer.
  C talks about slicing the cantaloupe, which is not mentioned in the text. So, C is not the answer.
  D is a plausible answer because it mentions that a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet. This adds to the information shared in the text. So, the most likely completion to the text is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text. 
  The text explains that a cantaloupe should not be harvested when the outer rind is still green, since it is unripe. The text further explains that once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, it is probably ripe. 
  Looking at the given choices, option A suggests that placing the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness will produce ripeness, which is not mentioned in the given text. Option B refers to dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots as indicators of ripeness, which is not necessarily true. Option C refers to slicing the cantaloupe, which is not related to harvesting or ripening the cantaloupe. 
  Option D is in line with the information provided in the text as it explains that the color of the cantaloupe is not the only indicator of ripeness and that a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text provides instructions on how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  The first step advises not to harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green.
  The second step mentions that once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, it is probably ripe.
  The question asks for the most likely completion to the given text.
  Option A is not likely since it does not provide information on how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  Option B is not likely since it provides different criteria to determine ripeness.
  Option C is not likely since it talks about determining ripeness after the cantaloupe is cut.
  Option D is likely since it provides a caution not to harvest based solely on color.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the given text is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text is about how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  The first step indicates not to harvest cantaloupe if the outer rind is still green.
  The second step mentions that the cantaloupe is ripe when it turns to a tan or yellow color.
  Option A seems incorrect because placing a cantaloupe in a container doesn't speed up the ripening process.
  Option B seems incorrect because the text doesn't mention anything about dark spots on the cantaloupe.
  Option C seems unlikely because a cantaloupe doesn't turn brown after slicing, and the text doesn't mention anything about placing the cantaloupe on the cutting board.
  Option D seems to be the correct answer because it mentions that not all yellow or tan cantaloupes may be ripe yet. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: "Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet."
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text is about how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  The first sentence states that the cantaloupe should not be harvested when it's still green.
  The second sentence describes the color the cantaloupe should be when it's probably ripe.
  None of the choices talk about how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  Choice A says placing the cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness, but it doesn't say how.
  Choice B talks about dark spots but doesn't say what to do once you see them.
  Choice C talks about cutting the cantaloupe, but it doesn't say how to ripen it.
  Choice D says that color alone is not a reliable indicator of ripeness, which is true based on the second sentence of the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Response 5:
Thought:

  C: then slices cheese and bacon together.
  D: then cuts up vegetables and butters bread then putting various ingredients on the bread to make a sandwich.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes someone putting bacon into a pan.
  The text does not mention eggs, so option A is unlikely.
  The text does not mention bread or a skillet, so option B is unlikely.
  The text only mentions bacon, so option C is a possibility.
  The text does not mention vegetables or assembling a sandwich, so option D is unlikely.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: then slices cheese and bacon together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text says a person is putting bacon into a pan.
  The completion that best fits with frying bacon is to cook it until it is crispy.
  None of the choices mention cooking the bacon until done.
  The completion that mentions cooking cheese and egg with the bacon seems to make the most sense.
  Therefore, the answer is A: then fries cheese and puts it in an egg pan, and scrubs it down with the spatula.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The photograph shows a person putting bacon into a pan.
  Choice B mentions using a skillet, but the photograph shows a pan.
  Choice C mentions slicing cheese and bacon together, but the person is only shown putting bacon in the pan.
  Choice D mentions cutting vegetables and buttering bread, but the photograph only shows bacon in a pan.
  Choice A mentions frying cheese and putting it in an egg pan, which is not shown in the photograph.
  Therefore, none of the choices match the photograph exactly, but choice A is the closest one. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a photograph of food, followed by a person putting bacon into a pan.
  Option A describes the person frying cheese and putting it in an egg pan, which is not related to the photograph of bacon.
  Option B describes the person using a skillet to melt cheese onto bread, which is not related to the photograph of bacon either.
  Option C describes the person slicing cheese and bacon together, which is related to the photograph of bacon but doesn't describe what happens next.
  Option D describes the person cutting up vegetables and putting various ingredients on bread to make a sandwich, which is not related to the photograph of bacon.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the person continues cooking the bacon in the pan and doesn't add any other ingredients.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text mentions that a person is putting bacon into a pan.
  The most likely next step in making a sandwich would be to cook the bacon.

  The answer is A: then fries cheese and puts it in an egg pan, and scrubs it down with the spatula.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The image shows a person putting bacon into a pan.
  It doesn't show any vegetables or bread.
  The most likely option is that the person will fry the bacon, and then do something else with it.
  Option A doesn't make sense because there is no mention of an egg pan or a spatula in the image or in the prompt.
  Option B doesn't make sense because there is no mention of bread in the image or in the prompt.
  Option D doesn't make sense because there is no mention of vegetables in the image or in the prompt, and the prompt is only asking about what happens after the bacon is put in the pan.
  Option C makes the most sense, because the person is putting bacon in the pan and then the prompt asks what is most likely to happen next. Slicing cheese and bacon together is a logical next step.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text mentions someone putting bacon in a pan.
  From the choices, only B and C mention cheese, which was not mentioned before.
  Choice A talks about frying cheese, which does not make sense in the context.
  Choice D seems to describe a different task altogether.
  Therefore, B or C are the most likely completions to the text.
  However, choice C is more likely to follow from the text as it mentions bacon and cheese together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The person puts bacon into a pan, so they are likely cooking the bacon.
  The completion to the text should describe the next step in making the sandwich.
  Option A describes cooking cheese and eggs, which is not mentioned in the original text.
  Option B describes melting cheese onto bread, which is also not mentioned.
  Option C says the person slices cheese and bacon together, which is possible but not conclusive from the original text.

  Therefore, the best completion to the text is the most likely next step in making the sandwich. This is Option C, where the person slices cheese and bacon together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The person puts bacon in a pan, which means they are most likely cooking it.
  The best option that continues from cooking bacon is option B, where the person uses a skillet to melt cheese onto bread, completing the process of making a bacon and cheese sandwich.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a photograph of food, followed by the person putting bacon into a pan.
  The bacon is the only ingredient mentioned in the text.
  None of the choices include adding bread to the pan.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the person will eventually cook the bacon and do something else with it.
  Choice C suggests that the person will slice the cheese and bacon together, which seems reasonable.

  Then, it suggests shopping in the petite section of stores if you're petite to boost your chances of finding clothes that fit properly.
  The most likely completion to the text is a substep that provides more advice on how to wear clothes that fit.
  Choice A provides advice on avoiding baggy and ill-fitting clothes.
  Choice B seems irrelevant and inappropriate.
  Choice C provides unrelated advice about accentuating body parts.
  Choice D provides the opposite advice of what the text is about, suggesting that the reader should wear vertical stripes to make their legs look shorter.
  Therefore, the answer is A: "Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly." 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text is providing tips on how to make short legs look longer.
  It suggests wearing clothes that fit properly, including fitted pants and tops.
  It also advises shopping in the petite section of stores.
  For the completion, we are looking for a statement that continues to provide advice on how to make short legs look longer.
  Choice A talks about the negative effects of baggy and ill-fitting clothes, and suggests avoiding such clothes.
  Choice B talks about an unrelated topic and does not provide any advice on how to make short legs look longer.
  Choice C talks about accentuating certain parts of the body, which is not directly related to making short legs look longer.
  Choice D provides advice that is the opposite of what is being discussed in the text, and is therefore incorrect.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: Baggy and ill-fitting clothes will only make you look frumpy, and will do nothing to lengthen your legs. Avoid buying clothes that don't fit you perfectly.

A close up of a fishing pole is shown with a person reeling it in. others
Choices:
  A: are shown capturing the fish that he has captured in the area.
  B: are shown mostly off in the water followed by more people reeling the fishing pole in.
  C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
  D: are seen on the bank watching a calf as it is released.
Response 0:
Thought: The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole while others are present. The question asks for the most likely completion to the text. 
  Choice A describes others capturing fish he has caught in the area, which does not logically follow from the initial description of the person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Choice B describes people in the water, which is not evident from the initial description.
  Choice D describes people watching a calf being released which is not related to the initial description of the fishing pole.
  Choice C, however, describes others kneeling around him as he continues to reel. This follows logically from the initial description of the fishing pole and the presence of others. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a fishing pole being reeled in by a person.
  The choices should describe what others are doing.
  Option A is incorrect as the text does not mention capturing fish in the area.
  Option B is incorrect as it does not make sense with the given information.
  Option D is irrelevant to the text.
  Option C is the most likely answer as it makes sense to have others watch and support the person fishing.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question describes a person reeling in a fishing pole, and others are shown. 
  They are not captured in the area as the question doesn't mention anything about capturing the fish. 
  They are not mostly off in the water as the person is only reeling the fishing pole. 
  They are not seen watching a calf as it is released as there is no mention of a calf in the question. 
  The most probable answer is that they kneel around him as he continues to reel. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole being reeled in.
  The text mentions "others", which implies that there are more people present in the scene.
  Option A does not seem likely, since it suggests that others are capturing fish while the person is reeling in his fishing pole, which does not make much sense.
  Option B also seems unlikely, as it suggests that most people are in the water, which is not likely for ice fishing.
  Option D is irrelevant to the scene, as it describes people watching a calf being released.
  Option C seems plausible, as it suggests that people are kneeling around the person as he continues to reel in his fishing pole.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text mentions "others".
  Option A does not fit the description as it says others are shown capturing fish. The text only describes one person reeling in. So, option A can be eliminated.
  Option B does not make sense as it says others are mostly off in the water. So, option B can be eliminated.
  Option D is completely unrelated to ice fishing and can be eliminated.
  Option C makes sense as it describes others kneeling around the person as he continues to reel. This is a common sight in ice fishing where people gather around the person fishing to watch the action and cheer them on.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  It then mentions "others", implying that other people are present.
  The only choice that follows from this is that others "kneel around him".
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The text describes a scene where a person is shown reeling a fishing pole in.
The question asks about the most likely completion to the text.
Therefore, the most likely completion is a description of what is happening around the person reeling in the fish.
Option A describes people capturing fish in the area, which is not related to the person reeling in the fish.
Option B describes people in the water followed by more people reeling in, which does not make much sense.
Option D describes people watching a calf being released, which is not related to the person reeling in the fish either.
Option C describes people kneeling around the person reeling, which is the most likely completion to the text.
Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text mentions a close-up of a fishing pole with a person reeling it in.
  The choices are all very different from each other.
  Option A describes other people capturing fish in the area, but the text only mentions one person reeling in a fish.
  Option B describes people in the water, but the text only mentions one person fishing.
  Option D talks about a calf, which is not related to the fishing scene at all.
  Option C is the most likely completion as it describes other people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the fish.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text also mentions other people in the scene.
  Based on what typically happens in ice fishing, it is likely that the other people are helping the person reel in the fish.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that "C: Kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a scene where a person is reeling in a fishing pole.
  The question is asking about the most likely completion to the text.
  Option A talks about "others" capturing fish, but it is not clear who they are.
  Option B talks about people mostly off in the water, which is not related to the scene described in the text.
  Option D talks about people watching a calf, which is also not related to the scene described in the text.
  Option C talks about people kneeling around him, which seems like the most likely completion to the text.

Topic: Clean and jerk
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
One of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him. then he
Choices:
  A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
  B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
  C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall.
  D: runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
Response 0:
Thought:
The sentence says "One of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him." This indicates that the bodybuilder is performing the weightlifting exercise called the "clean and jerk," which involves lifting the weight bar and then dropping it down. Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is that the bodybuilder will lift the weight bar again and drop it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a bodybuilder lifting and dropping a weight bar while the other two bodybuilders watch.
  The word "then" suggests that there will be a continuation of the events described.
  The correct completion is most likely to describe what the bodybuilder does next after lifting and dropping the weight bar.
  Option A describes the bodybuilder wiping sweat and lifting again, which is possible, but not clearly indicated in the passage.
  Option C and D describe unrealistic and dangerous events that are not mentioned in the passage.
  Option B describes the bodybuilder releasing the beam and dropping it near the floor, which is possible because the passage only mentions the weight bar being lifted and dropped, but it is not the most likely completion as it is not clearly indicated in the passage.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the passage is that the bodybuilder picks up the weight bar again and repeats the lifting and dropping action.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text describes a body builder who lifts the weight bar several times and drops it, while other body builders watch him.
  The sentence starts with "then he", indicating that we are looking for an action that follows the previous events.
  None of the choices seems to be a direct continuation of the body builder's actions.
  Choice A describes the body builder wiping his sweat and lifting the weight bar again and dropping it. It seems to be unrelated to the previous sentence.
  Choice B talks about releasing a beam, which was not mentioned earlier, and dropping it near the floor. This is also unrelated to the previous sentence.
  Choice C says that the body builder lifts for another couple of seconds and then drops the weight, and the other body builders fall. This seems unlikely and does not make sense.
  Choice D talks about the body builder running towards the weight, and the others falling with the weight. This is also unlikely and does not make sense.
  None of the choices seem to be a likely completion of the text.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question is asking for a likely completion to the text.
  The text says that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him.
  The correct option should describe what the bodybuilder does after he lifts and drops the weight bar.
  Option A describes the bodybuilder wiping off his sweat with a towel, lifting the weight bar again, and dropping it.
  Option B describes the bodybuilder releasing the weight bar and the beam he was holding.
  Option C describes the bodybuilder continuing to lift for another couple of seconds and then dropping the weight, causing the other body builders to fall.
  Option D describes the bodybuilder running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
  Option A is the most likely completion as it is the most reasonable action that a bodybuilder would take after lifting and dropping a weight bar.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a body builder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it while two other body builders watch him.
  The word "then" is important as it suggests that the body builder is about to do something else.
  The correct completion to the sentence should logically follow what happened before.
  Option A describes the body builder wiping his sweat, which is possible, but the text does not mention that he was sweating.
  Option C suggests that the body builder lifts the weight again and then drops it for the second time, but this is not what the text says.
  Option D does not make sense and is not related to what is happening in the text.
  Option B describes the body builder releasing the weight bar and the beam he was holding, which is possible and logical based on what was described earlier.
  Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes one of the body builders lifting the weight bar several times and then dropping it down.
  The text mentions that the other two body builders were watching him.
  Based on this information, we can assume that the body builder would repeat the same action, i.e. lift the weight bar again and drop it.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text mentions that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times. 
  The text also mentions that the other two body builders watch him.
  Then it says, "then he" which implies that we need to complete the sentence with an appropriate action.
  The most logical completion to the sentence is that the body builder drops the weight bar down.
  Answer: B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text states that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times.
  The next sentence says that he drops it down while the other two body builders watch him.
  Therefore, we need to find the most likely sentence that describes what he does after dropping the weight bar.
  Option A mentions wiping off sweat, but that is not mentioned in the initial text.
  Option B mentions releasing a beam, but that is not mentioned in the initial text.
  Option C mentions falling body builders, which is not consistent with the initial text.
  Option D mentions the other body builders falling, which is not consistent with the initial text.
  Therefore, none of the options seem to be the most likely completion of the text.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage is describing an action of a body builder lifting a weight bar and then dropping it.
  The passage gives no indication that the body builder wiped off any sweat.
  Answer choice A can be eliminated.
  Answer choice C does not make sense as the body builders cannot fall from the weight bar.
  Answer choice D is not mentioned in the text and can be eliminated.
  Answer choice B describes the body builder releasing the weight bar and a beam and then dropping it near the floor.
  Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The term "clean and jerk" refers to a weightlifting movement where you lift the weight to your shoulders, then lift it over your head, and then drop it back down.
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down while others watch him.
  The action of lifting the weight several times before dropping it and the context of body builders suggest that the body builder was performing the clean and jerk movement.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that he "lifts the weight bar again and drops it."
  The answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.

  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text.
  The first two steps of the text provide guidance on how to talk to a child about a bad grade.
  The third step should follow this pattern.
  Option A is irrelevant and not related to the topic.
  Option B is relevant and important, but it is about what not to say to a child when talking about a bad grade.
  Option C is also irrelevant and not related to the topic.
  Option D talks about a child's capability and encourages them to make good grades. However, it doesn't explain how to talk to a child about a bad grade.

  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text which includes advice on how to talk to a child about a bad grade.
  The first two choices do not address the prompt and have irrelevant information.
  The third choice has incorrect information that doesn't relate to the prompt.
  The fourth choice mentions staying calm and positive which is a good way to approach a child about a bad grade. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: [step] Since preschool age children cannot achieve success in school and some teachers are no longer motivated to work with them, they may feel incomplete or powerless to make their students feel successful. Stay calm and upbeat that the child is competent and capable of making good grades.

Choices:
  A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
  B: is shown performing the act again in slow motion.
  C: lands on the grass with her arms outstretched.
  D: lands on a mat behind her.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes a girl running down a track and taking a huge jump.
  The girl "hurls herself over a bar," which suggests that the girl is performing the high jump.
  In the high jump, athletes jump over a bar and land on a mat behind them.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the girl "lands on a mat behind her."
  The answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: The sentence states that the girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar. This is a clear indication that the girl is performing a high jump. Typically, in high jump competitions, athletes jump over a bar and land on a mat. Therefore, option A is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes a girl running and jumping over a bar in slow motion.
  She takes a huge jump, implying that she cleared the bar.
  A mat is usually placed on the other side of the bar to cushion the fall if the athlete cannot clear the bar.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that she lands on a mat behind her.
  The answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Based on what is described in the text, the girl in slow motion jumps over a bar.
  The completion to the sentence must be about what happens after the girl jumps over the bar.
  The most logical completion to the sentence must be that she "lands" somewhere.
  Options A, B, and D mention a mat, which could be used to cushion the impact of the landing.
  Option C mentions the grass, which provides no cushioning, making it an unlikely choice.
  Option A mentions the girl marking her score, which doesn't make sense without further context.
  Option B mentions the girl performing the act again, which could be a possibility, but not the most likely.
  Option D mentions a mat behind the girl, which doesn't make sense with the rest of the sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is that she "lands on a mat."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar. This is likely a high jump competition. 
  A mat is commonly placed just after the bar in a high jump competition where the athlete is expected to land.
  Option A mentions that the girl lands on a mat, marking her dark score, which could be interpreted as a typo for "marking her mark score", meaning she landed successfully and her score was recorded.
  Option B suggests that the act is performed again in slow motion which seems unnecessary in the context of the story.
  Option C mentions that the girl lands on the grass with her arms outstretched which seems unlikely in a high jump competition.
  Option D mentions that the girl lands on a mat behind her which seems unlikely as the mat is usually placed after the bar.
  Therefore, the best option is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a girl running down a track and taking a huge jump over a bar.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the girl lands somewhere.
  Option A says she lands on a mat, which is a common landing zone for high jump.
  Option B says she performs the act again, but it doesn't describe where she lands.
  Option C says she lands on the grass, which is not a common landing zone for high jump.
  Option D says she lands on a mat behind her, which is a possibility, but the text doesn't provide enough information to suggest that this is the case.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence states that the girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The sentence provides no indication that the girl did not clear the bar.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The text is about attracting barn owls.
  The first step is to keep a shed open to the wild and leave the door open.
  Option A talks about bringing wooden poles to keep them out, which is not in line with the topic.
  Option B talks about shelter but incoherently.
  Option C mentions putting a bird box, which is not the same as keeping the shed open.
  Option D talks about using owl-repellent, which is not what the text is about.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to leave the door open and make sure the barn owls have easy access. 
  The answer is A: Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them. [title] Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text is about how to attract barn owls.
  The first step is to clear everything out and give the shed a bit of a dust so that the barn owl will probably make a nest there.

  Option A talks about keeping out creatures, which is not related to how to attract barn owls.
  Option B talks about shelter, but it is not related to the first step either.
  Option C suggests putting a bird box on a pole, which is somewhat related, but not the most likely step to attract them.
  Option D mentions an owl-repellent, which is not useful in attracting them.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: "Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them. [title] Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground." 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The title suggests that the shed should be open to the wild to attract barn owls.
  The step mentions that clearing out the shed and leaving the door open will encourage barn owls to make a nest inside.
  The substeps may provide further information on how to attract barn owls.
  None of the choices seem to provide relevant information on how to attract barn owls other than choice A which suggests keeping out non-winged animals.
  Therefore, choice A is the most likely completion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The text provides instruction on how to attract barn owls. 
One suggestion mentioned in the text is to keep the shed open for the barn owls by leaving the door open for them to enter.
Out of the four options, only option A mentions the barn owls climbing in, which contradicts the instruction to leave the door open for them. 
Option B talks about providing shelter but doesn't mention anything about the shed door or barn owls entering the shed.
Option C is about putting a bird box on a pole, which is irrelevant to the topic of leaving the shed open for barn owls to nest.
Option D is about purchasing an owl-repellent, which contradicts the instruction to attract barn owls.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: They can climb in, if they do not have wings or owls need air. Consider bringing a pair of wooden wading poles to keep them out. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The title, 'How to attract barn owls', suggests that the completion will involve tips on how to make one's shed attractive to barn owls.
  The step, 'Clear everything out and give it a bit of dust', might imply that owls prefer a clean nesting environment.
  The substep, 'Make sure you leave the door open for the barn owls', suggests that owls need an open door to access the nesting site.
  Choice A talks about preventing non-winged creatures from entering the shed and is not related to attracting barn owls.
  Choice B talks about shelter for barn owls and stumbling into something, but the text does not mention this issue or need for shelter.
  Choice C talks about putting a bird box on a pole, which is a different method of attracting birds and not relevant to the text.
  Choice D talks about using an owl-repellent, while the text is about attracting not repelling barn owls.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is about leaving the shed open and not worrying about mice or rats, as the barn owls will eat them, and also suggests putting up a bird box.
  The answer is C: Don't worry about mice and rats getting in, as the barn owls will eat them. [title] Put a bird box on a pole, about 2 and a half metres off the ground. 
Action: Answer("C")

  This is similar to the first step, but focuses specifically on the shelter the barn owls will need.
  The answer is B: This way, they won't be able to climb in! [title] Provide enough shelter. [step] The barn owl might stumble into something on the way home from a trip to town.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text discusses the importance of discussing time arrangements when co-parenting with an uncooperative ex-spouse.
  Option A does not relate to the text as it talks about not letting the court rule "no" even if the child wants to graduate with the parent. 
  Option B also does not relate to the text as it talks about how the separation will affect the "intended child's future".
  Option C seems to be the best answer because it discusses the importance of discussing the time arrangements, who is responsible for the child, and who is responsible for care-taking activities.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If you don't think you can decide on one alone, consider talking with a counselor to help work it out. [substeps] You need to discuss what nights the child will be spending with which parent, who's responsible for what activities, and who's responsible for which care-taking activities.

[substeps] You need to discuss what nights the child will be spending with which parent, who's responsible for what activities, and who's responsible for which care-taking activities. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The heading suggests a guide on co-parenting with an uncooperative ex-spouse.

  Option A is not relevant to the steps in the text.
  Option B talks about the "intended child's future," which is not a part of the text.
  Option C suggests that if the parents don't think they can decide together, they should consider talking with a counselor.
  Also, it goes on to suggest that the discussion should include what nights the child will spend with each parent, who will be responsible for what activities, and who will be responsible for which care-taking activities.
  Therefore, option C is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text mentions that it is important to have a discussion about time arrangements if the court has not mandated them.

  Choice A discusses a child wanting to graduate with you which is not related to the topic.
  Choice B discusses the intended child's future which is not related to the topic.
  Choice D discusses finding alternatives, which is not related to the topic.
  Choice C mentions the relevant substeps and suggests talking with a counselor if needed.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: If you don't think you can decide on one alone, consider talking with a counselor to help work it out. You need to discuss what nights the child will be spending with which parent, who's responsible for what activities, and who's responsible for which care-taking activities. 
Action: Answer("C")

  Choice A talks about not letting the court rule "no" even if the child wants to graduate with you, which is irrelevant.
  Choice B talks about setting out deadlines and defining when the child will get the benefits that they are seeking, which is also irrelevant.
  Choice C suggests seeking the help of a counselor to work it out, which is a good suggestion, but it does not give detailed advice on how to discuss time arrangements.

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.

  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.

  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.

  Option D talks about applicators which are not mentioned in the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the given text is, "If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. [substeps] Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess.".
  The answer is C. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text is about how to apply a mud mask, and this step is about scooping out some beauty mud.
  The next step is about using your middle and ring fingers to scoop out some of the beauty mud.
  The choice that fits this step would be the one that talks about how much beauty mud to scoop out and the size of the scoop.
  Choice A talks about the size of the finger, which is not relevant to the step.
  Choice B talks about using other small amounts of mud, but it doesn't give enough information about the size of the scoop.
  Choice D talks about products that come with an applicator. It is not relevant to the step.
  Choice C talks about scooping out a larger amount of mud if you'd like to apply a thick layer, which fits the step.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. [substeps] Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess." 
  The answer is C. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text is about "How to apply a mud mask".
  The first step is to "scoop out some beauty mud".
  The next sentence "Start with a small amount, about the size of a dime" suggests that the amount of beauty mud to be scooped out should be small.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess."
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text explains how to apply a mud mask. 
  The first step is to scoop out some of the beauty mud.
  The text then suggests using a small amount of mud.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. [substeps] Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The first sentence says to scoop out some beauty mud.
  The second sentence suggests starting with a small amount, about the size of a dime.
  The next sentence should provide additional information on how much mud to use.
  Choice A is not a good completion as it talks about the size of the finger, which is not the point of the text.
  Choice B is also not a good completion as it talks about the thickness of the mud, which is irrelevant to the procedure of scooping the mud.
  Choice C is the best completion as it suggests that more mud can be scooped if a thick layer is desired.
  The substeps that follow are also helpful as they talk about the importance of adding the right amount of mud.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text is about how to apply a mud mask, and the first step is to scoop out some beauty mud.
  The second sentence could be hinting that we should start small and increase the amount depending on preference.
  Choice A mentions washing your hands and face, but this instruction is not directly related to the first step.
  Choice B is suggesting that we can use different amounts of mud depending on preference, but it doesn't give a clear next step.
  Choice C is the most likely completion as it suggests that we can apply a thicker layer by scooping out more mud, and also gives a substep on how to apply the mud.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. [substeps] Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes how to apply a mud mask.
  The first step is to use your middle and ring fingers to scoop out some of the mud.
  The second sentence suggests starting with a small amount, the size of a dime.
  The completion that fits logically with the previous information is "If you'd like to apply a thick layer of beauty mud, you can scoop out a larger amount. Remember, it's easier to add beauty mud to your face than remove excess."
  Therefore, the answer is C.

Choices:
  A: Let him or her take the lead, but try to appear as engaged as possible as you challenge your partner to compromise or change his or her mind. Avoid waiting until the timing is perfect to truly ask.
  B: Be thoughtful and allow your partner to decide the next level of urgency (the best time for you and for your relationship). [title] Have your heart set on the proposal.
  C: Don't give any indication that you expect it. [substeps] If you find out for certain that your partner is planning to propose, you can take two approaches.
  D: Waiting for a truly spontaneous proposal to come to fruition is unheard of. [substeps] Ask your partner what they'd want if you were the lucky one and they were your best friend.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text is giving advice on how to accept a marriage proposal.
  The first step is to not ruin the surprise.
  The following sentence advises not to rush the process along.
  The most likely completion is an additional step or advice that builds on the previous step.
  Option A advises to challenge the partner and avoid waiting for perfect timing, which does not align with the previous advice of not rushing the process along.
  Option B advises to be thoughtful and allow the partner to decide the next level of urgency, which does align with the previous advice of not rushing the process along.
  Option C advises not to give any indication that you expect it, which does align with the previous advice of not ruining the surprise.
  Option D advises to ask the partner what they'd want if you were the lucky one and they were your best friend, which is not directly related to the previous advice of not ruining the surprise or not rushing the process along.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is Option B: Be thoughtful and allow your partner to decide the next level of urgency (the best time for you and for your relationship). [title] Have your heart set on the proposal. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: The text provides advice on accepting a marriage proposal.
  It suggests not to ruin the surprise and allow the partner to carry out their plan.
  Option A suggests challenging the partner to compromise or change their mind, which is not supportive of the proposal or the relationship.
  Option B suggests being thoughtful and allowing the partner to decide the next level of urgency, but it does not provide any additional steps.
  Option D suggests asking the partner what they would want if you were the lucky one and they were your best friend, which is not related to accepting a marriage proposal.
  Option C, which suggests not giving any indication that you expect the proposal, is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text advises not to ruin the surprise and to let the partner carry out their plan.
  The first choice suggests trying to challenge one's partner to compromise or change their mind, which goes against the advice given in the text.
  The second choice suggests being thoughtful and allowing the partner to decide the next level of urgency.
  While being thoughtful is good advice, the text advises not to ruin the surprise and doesn't mention letting the partner decide the next level of urgency.
  The third choice suggests not giving any indication that you expect it, which aligns with the advice given in the text.
  The fourth choice suggests asking one's partner what they want if they were in the proposer's shoes, which doesn't align with the advice given in the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Don't give any indication that you expect it. [substeps] If you find out for certain that your partner is planning to propose, you can take two approaches.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The first sentence says "Don't ruin the surprise." 
  The next sentence advises not to rush the process along. 
  The most fitting answer to complete the text will probably be about waiting for the proposal.
  Choice A suggests challenging the partner to compromise or change his or her mind, which is not in line with the previous sentences. 
  Choice B suggests giving the partner control of the timing, but it doesn't address the issue of waiting for the proposal. 
  Choice D suggests asking the partner about the proposal, which is not good advice if you want to maintain the surprise.
  Therefore, the best answer to complete the text is C, which suggests not giving any indication that you expect the proposal, and then presents two options if you find out for certain that your partner is planning to propose.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text is about accepting a marriage proposal.
  The step given is to allow your partner to carry out their plan and not to rush the process along.
  The most likely completion to this text will be about giving the partner the chance to propose without ruining the surprise.
  The completion that best fits this description is C: Don't give any indication that you expect it. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text is about how to accept a marriage proposal.
  The first step is to not ruin the surprise if you suspect your partner is going to propose.
  The second step should be related to giving your partner the opportunity to propose without any unnecessary pressure.
  Taking a look at the answer choices, option A and D don't seem to agree with the steps laid out in the text.
  Option B could work, but it doesn't provide any steps to follow.
  Option C, on the other hand, agrees with the second step, and it also provides further guidance for a specific scenario.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Don't give any indication that you expect it. [substeps] If you find out for certain that your partner is planning to propose, you can take two approaches.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text is about how to accept a marriage proposal.
  The first step is to let your partner carry out the proposal plan.
  The other choices have nothing to do with accepting the proposal, so they are unlikely to be the completion.
  Choice A suggests challenging your partner's mind and not waiting for the perfect timing. This does not align with the idea of giving your partner the chance to carry out the proposal plan.
  Choice B suggests being thoughtful and having your heart set on the proposal, but this is not a step or action to accept the proposal.
  Choice D suggests asking your partner what they'd want if you were the lucky one and they were your best friend, but this is not related to the process of accepting the proposal.
  Choice C suggests not giving any indication that you expect the proposal. This aligns with the idea of giving your partner the chance to carry out the proposal plan.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Don't give any indication that you expect it. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The title "Don't ruin the surprise" suggests that it's important to not interfere with the proposal process.
  The step "If you believe that your partner plans to propose to you, give him or her the chance to carry out a plan" supports this idea.
  The completion that best follows this step is to "Don't give any indication that you expect it", as giving any clue can impact the surprise factor.
  The choice that matches this completion is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text provides advice on how to accept a marriage proposal.
  The first step advises to not ruin the surprise, and to let the partner carry out the plan.
  One of the choices talks about being thoughtful and allowing the partner to decide the next level of urgency, which could mean waiting for the partner to propose.
  Another choice talks about not giving any indication that you expect it. This is the opposite of the advice in the first step.
  Another choice advises one to ask their partner what they would want if they were in the same situation.
  The only choice that aligns with the advice given in the first step is B. It advises allowing the partner to decide the next level of urgency and to have your heart set on the proposal.
Action: Answer("B")

Choices:
  A: dries off the mask and continues speaking while smiling to the camera.
  B: braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face.
  C: then pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off.
  D: wipes down her face and leads back to her.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The woman is rubbing honey on her face.
  The question is asking what she does immediately after that.
  Option A mentions 'drying off the mask' which is not mentioned in the text. So, it is not the correct answer.
  Option B says 'puts it to her face', but she is already rubbing honey on her face. So, it does not make sense.
  Option C says she pours honey onto her fingers after already rubbing honey on her face, it is not likely.
  Option D says she wipes down her face, which could be a possible step after she has applied honey on her face.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: wipes down her face and leads back to her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The woman leads into rubbing honey on her face.
  The next sentence should describe what the woman does after putting the honey on her face.
  "dries off the mask and continues speaking while smiling to the camera" seems like a reasonable answer.
  "braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face" does not seem like a good answer since it suggests the woman is not applying the honey to her face.
  "then pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off" does not seem like a good answer since it implies that the woman pours honey onto her fingers AFTER putting the honey on her face.
  "wipes down her face and leads back to her" does not seem like a good answer since it implies that the woman wipes off the honey immediately after applying it.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is "dries off the mask and continues speaking while smiling to the camera."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The woman rubs honey on her face.
  The question is about what she does after rubbing honey on her face.
  The choices are not very clear, but it seems like the most likely completion would be that she wipes off the honey from her face.

Choice A does not seem to follow from the given text.
Choice B might be possible, but it is less likely than choice C.
Choice D does not seem to follow from the given text.
Therefore, the answer is C: then pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The woman is seen holding up a jar of honey and leads into her rubbing honey on her face.
  Each of the answer choices describes an action that may or may not fit with the context.
  However, only one choice makes sense and is related to washing face.
  Applying honey to the face is a way to wash the face.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that she applies the honey to her face.
  The answer is B: braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The woman is seen holding up a jar of honey.
  She continues speaking and leads into her rubbing honey on her face.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The woman holds up a jar of honey and then rubs it on her face.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The woman holds up a jar of honey and leads into her rubbing honey on her face. 
This indicates that the woman is demonstrating a method of washing face using honey. 
The next step should be related to the method of washing face using honey.
Option A, B, and D seem to be unrelated to the washing face method.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is option C: then pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text mentions a woman holding up a jar of honey and then rubbing honey on her face.

  The only choice that mentions people riding a boat is C.
  However, the rest of the choice does not make sense with the given text.
  The best option is to choose the choice that makes the most sense based on the text, which is B.
  B talks about people being on the shore and on the boat, which is what the text describes.
  Therefore, the answer is B: are on the shore and some are on the boat.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The text mentions that people are riding a boat, a lady is hula hooping to music, and a male is leaping from rocks into the water. There is no mention of people on a beach, and it is unlikely that people on boats are flipping on the water because the text does not mention any wakeboarding or water sports.

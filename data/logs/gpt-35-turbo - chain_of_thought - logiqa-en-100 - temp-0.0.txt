Topic: Logic
Context: The basis of life-the main component of protein is an amino acid molecule.It is an organic molecule.Although people have not directly observed amino acid molecules in cosmic space, scientists have used hydrogen, water, oxygen, methane and formaldehyde in the laboratory to simulate the natural conditions of space.Kinds of amino acids.The raw materials used to synthesize amino acids are abundant in interstellar molecules.It is not difficult to imagine that there must also be amino acid molecules in the universe.As long as there is an appropriate environment, they may be transformed into proteins and further develop into organic life.According to this speculation, there are living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence.
Question: Which of the following is true to best refute the above speculation?
Choices:
  A: There is a huge difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein
  B: Higher intelligence is not only a product of material evolution, but also a product of continuous socialization
  C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event
  D: Some interstellar molecules are not found in the Earth ’s environment, and they are still not available in the laboratory

Context: Placebo effect" refers to the phenomenon of letting patients take fake drugs that have no effect at all without knowing it, but they can get the same or better effects than real drugs.The "placebo effect" has been supported by many clinical studies.One explanation for this phenomenon is that human expectations for the future will change the physiological state of the brain, which in turn will cause physiological changes throughout the body.
Question: The following statements can support the above explanation, except
Choices:
  A: The placebo effect is the result of a combination of factors.
  B: Placebo has no effect on Alzheimer's patients who have lost their expected future abilities.
  C: Some patients do not believe that the treatment will be effective.Although they have been treated normally, their condition has worsened.
  D: Inject the subject with normal saline and make him believe that it is an analgesic.The subject's brain then secretes the analgesic endorphin.

Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.

Topic: Logic
Context: Why did ancient Greece have a city-state system, but there was a long-standing monarchy in Eastern countries? Aristotle believes that the monarchy is often seen among barbarians and is very close to the tyrant or tyrant system.Because the nature of the barbarian people is inherently more national and more enslaved than Greece, and the slavishness of the Asian barbarians is more than that of the Europa barbarians, so they are subject to dictatorship and do not rebel.
Question: If the following statements are true, all but one can weaken Aristotle ’s interpretation
Choices:
  A: City-state manufacturing has brought about the autonomy of citizens, and the monarchy has created the slavery of Shunmin.
  B: The difference in geographical environment has created the difference between the city-state system and the monarchy
  C: Aristotle's explanation is emotionally difficult for most Orientals to accept
  D: The difference between civilized people and barbarians is caused by different cultural and social organizations

Topic: Logic
Context: European fern is a poisonous wild grass that has spread and destroyed many pastures in the northern hemisphere in recent years.One way to deal with this wild grass is to spend less money and be self-sustaining by introducing the natural enemy of this plant.Therefore, some scientists suggested that the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere were released into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
Question: If the scientist ’s proposal to control the European fern is adopted, which of the following is necessary for its success?
Choices:
  A: This northern fern of the northern hemisphere also grows in areas with similar climate and soil conditions in the southern hemisphere.
  B: In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere.
  C: The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth.
  D: When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.

Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.
  B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve.
  C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food.
  D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption.
Response 0:

(1) G must be performed in the third week.(2) O and S cannot perform continuously.(3) K must be arranged before J and S.(4) F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
Question: If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then which week must R be scheduled?
Choices:
  A: the second week
  B: Fourth week
  C: fifth week
  D: Seventh week
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since there are only 7 weeks, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth, or fifth week.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  If O is scheduled for the first week, then K must be scheduled for the second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and fifth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which violates condition (2).
  If O is scheduled for the second week, then K must be scheduled for the first week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and fifth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which violates condition (2).
  If O is scheduled for the fourth week, then K must be scheduled for the first or second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fifth and sixth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the third week, which satisfies all conditions.
  If O is scheduled for the fifth week, then K must be scheduled for the first or second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and sixth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which violates condition (2).

Topic: Logic
Context: The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.There is no other explanation.The fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, For example, Qiangua is the heaven, and Qian is the ancient Chinese character, so it is named Qian; in the sense of meaning, the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.The Lord is supple, so the hexagram is Kun, and Kun is the meaning of suppleness
Question: Which of the following statements is true, which most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name?
Choices:
  A: The reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth.
  B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names
  C: Although there are many different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, it is inseparable from its sect, either attributed to the theory of fetching images, or attributed to the theory of fetching meanings
  D: The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse.At the beginning, he had three elephants.He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A does not shake the traditional view, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the traditional view.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names. This statement challenges the traditional view and provides a new perspective.
  Statement C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Statement D provides an example of how a hexagram was named, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A does not shake the traditional view, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the traditional view.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names. This statement challenges the traditional view and provides a new perspective.

  The passage states that the growth of energy consumption in a region is positively correlated with economic growth, and the difference in growth between the two is usually no more than 15%.
  In 2003, a statistical report from Zhejiang Province showed that the province's energy consumption increased by 30%, while the economic growth rate was 12.7%.
  Option A suggests that the growth of some private economy is difficult to be counted, which could explain the inconsistency.
  Option B suggests that some local officials underreported the economic growth figures, which could also explain the inconsistency.
  Option C suggests that the economic growth of large state-owned enterprises with high energy consumption generally declined due to the sharp increase in energy prices, which could explain the inconsistency.
  Option D suggests that 90% of the newly invested enterprises in Zhejiang are low-energy enterprises, which does not explain the inconsistency.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Due to the sharp increase in energy prices, 90% of the newly invested enterprises in Zhejiang are low-energy enterprises.

Topic: Logic
Context: Researchers in a country reported that they found meteorites about 200 million years old in the strata of a certain area, and they were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada.The clay layer with a thickness of about 5 cm also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground.In addition, this rock also contains special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques.Since the upper and lower strata also contain marine plankton fossils, it can be determined that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
Question: Which of the following, if true, would best support the above research findings?
Choices:
  A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground
  B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale
  C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface
  D: In ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth

Context: Sun Tzu's Art of War" said? "Bing Gui wins, it is not long."

Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.
  D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

  We need to find a statement that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view.
  A: This statement supports the expert's point of view. It suggests that the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge is causing problems for the transportation of goods.
  B: This statement suggests that most international ships do not need to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, so it may not be necessary to demolish and rebuild the bridge.
  C: This statement suggests that there are other bridges with the same clear height as the Nanjing Bridge, so demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge alone may not be enough to solve the problem.
  D: This statement suggests that shipbuilding technology has advanced to the point where 8000-ton ships can pass through the Nanjing Bridge, so it may not be necessary to demolish and rebuild the bridge.
  Therefore, the statement that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view is B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.

Topic: Logic
Context: The virtuous cycle of the economy refers to not relying too much on government investment and relying on its own power to achieve a basic balance of total social supply and total social demand and economic growth.In recent years, China ’s steady economic growth has been achieved through increased government investment.
Question: If the above statement is true, which of the following conclusions can best be supported?
Choices:
  A: The virtuous cycle of the economy can be realized only by the investment momentum and consumption momentum generated by the economy itself.
  B: The virtuous cycle of the economy is a prerequisite for achieving a basic balance between total social supply and total demand.
  C: Stable economic growth in a certain period does not mean that the economy in this period has turned into a virtuous circle.
  D: In recent years, China's economic growth rate has remained above 7%.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The statement mentions that China's economic growth has been achieved through increased government investment.
  This implies that China is not relying on its own power to achieve a basic balance of total social supply and total social demand and economic growth.
  Therefore, the virtuous cycle of the economy is not being realized in China.
  Option A is incorrect because it states that the virtuous cycle of the economy can only be realized by the investment momentum and consumption momentum generated by the economy itself.
  Option B is incorrect because it states that the virtuous cycle of the economy is a prerequisite for achieving a basic balance between total social supply and total demand.
  Option D is incorrect because it is not related to the conclusion that can be supported by the statement.
  Therefore, the best conclusion that can be supported is that stable economic growth in a certain period does not mean that the economy in this period has turned into a virtuous circle.

Choices:
  A: Comparative advertising should not be used in an expanding or potentially expanding market.
  B: Comparative advertising runs the risk of shrinking their target market instead of expanding.

Context: A survey of traffic accidents has found that the incidence of traffic accidents is actually similar in cities where drunk driving is strictly investigated and those who do not.However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can indeed reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
Question: Which of the following is most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency?
Choices:
  A: Severe investigations of drunk driving have occurred in urban traffic accidents.
  B: The city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  C: It is more important to improve drivers' traffic safety awareness than strict management.
  D: In addition to strict investigation of drunk driving, other traffic violations should also be stopped.
Response 0:

  The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with strict investigation of drunk driving and those without.
  However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
  The inconsistency is that the survey result contradicts the experts' belief.
  To eliminate this inconsistency, we need to find an option that explains why the survey result is not consistent with the experts' belief.
  Option B provides a possible explanation that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  This explanation suggests that although strict investigation of drunk driving is implemented, it may not be effective in eliminating drunk driving, which may still contribute to traffic accidents.
  Therefore, option B is the most helpful in eliminating this inconsistency.

Topic: Logic
Context: I can relate some external symbols to some inner events, for example, to associate moaning and face distortion with the feeling of pain.I learned from the pain experience that when I feel pain, I often moan and twist my face.Therefore, once I see that others have the same external signs, I take it for granted that they also have the same inner activity events as me.After all, between me and others, the behavior and normal physiological functions are obviously similar.Why aren't they similar in inner activities?
Question: Which of the following can most strongly support the above argument?
Choices:
  A: Similar results must have similar reasons.
  B: There may be a close connection between pain and moaning and face twisting.
  C: There may be an intrinsic relationship between behavior and inner activities.
  D: People are similar in many ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that because the external signs of pain are similar across individuals, it is reasonable to assume that the inner activity events are also similar.
  Choice A is too general and does not specifically address the relationship between external signs and inner activity events.
  Choice B supports the idea that there is a close connection between pain and the external signs of moaning and face twisting, but it does not directly address the relationship between external signs and inner activity events.
  Choice C is the best answer because it suggests that there is an intrinsic relationship between behavior (external signs) and inner activities, which supports the argument that similar external signs indicate similar inner activity events.
  Choice D is too general and does not specifically address the relationship between external signs and inner activity events.

  Choice B supports the idea that there is a close connection between pain and the external signs of moaning and face twisting, but it does not directly address the relationship between external signs and inner activity events.
  Choice C is the best answer because it suggests that there is an intrinsic relationship between behavior (external signs) and inner activities, which supports the argument that similar external signs indicate similar inner activity events.
  Choice D is too general and does not specifically address the relationship between external signs and inner activity events.

  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F and M cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  Therefore, the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be one of the other four assistants: G, H, I, or P.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then F is not in charge of the department that the assistant general manager in charge of three departments is in charge of.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then I is not in charge of the department that the assistant general manager in charge of three departments is in charge of.
  Therefore, the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be either G or P.
  If the assistant general manager in charge of three departments is G, then G is in charge of the department that F is not in charge of, and H and I are each in charge of a different department.
  Therefore, F and I are not in charge of the same department.
  If the assistant general manager in charge of three departments is P, then P is in charge of the department that F is not in charge of, and H and I are each in charge of a different department.
  Therefore, F and I are not in charge of the same department.
  Therefore, F and I are not in charge of the same department, which means that the answer is B: F and I are in charge of the same department.

Context: twenty two.WiFi transmitters generate electromagnetic radiation.Five Danish middle school students put cress seeds in a room with a WiFi transmitter and without a WiFi transmitter for cultivation.After 12 days, they found that the germination rate of the seeds in the room without a WiFi transmitter was 95.4%, with WiFi transmission The germination rate of seeds in the machine room was 85.3%.Many people worry that WiFi radiation will affect human health.However, many experts believe that the above experiment is not rigorous, and it cannot be concluded that WiFi radiation is harmful to humans.
Question: Which of the following assertions can support the opinions of these experts?
Choices:
  A: The impact of WiFi radiation on the human body is related not only to its frequency, but also to the distance between the WiFi transmitter and the human body.
  B: Keep other conditions unchanged in the same room, and repeat the experiment with and without a WiFi transmitter.
  C: There are many factors that affect the germination of seeds, and experiments by Danish middle school students cannot exclude the interference of other factors.

  The common sense is that investors should reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.
  To explain the violation of common sense, we need to find a statement that provides a reason why investors did not reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  Statement A is not relevant to the question.
  Statement B suggests that US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared with the bonds of other countries, which may explain why investors did not reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  Statement C is not relevant to the question.
  Statement D is not relevant to the question.
  Therefore, the best explanation of the above-mentioned violation of common sense is statement B.

Topic: Logic
Context: Homo erectus originated in Africa about 2 million years ago and spread to Eurasia; modern people appeared about 200,000 years ago.Both human fossils are distributed in China.For example, the "Beijing people" unearthed in the ancient stratum of Zhoukoudian, Beijing belonged to Homo erectus; the "shandingdong people" in the stratum of the previous year belonged to modern people.A study of the contemporary Chinese population found that the Y chromosome inherited from the paternal lineage originated in Africa and originated in 8.9 10,000 years to 35,000 years ago; the mitochondrial DNA inherited from the maternal line originated in Africa, with a time of origin within 100,000 years; no genetic component of H.erectus was detected
Question: If the above statement is true, which hypothesis is best supported?
Choices:
  A: The descendants of "Beijing people" may be extinct.The ancestors of Chinese contemporary people came to Asia from Africa about 100,000 years ago
  B: Chinese Homo erectus and modern people are from the African continent, and their hybrid descendants are the ancestors of contemporary Chinese

Topic: Logic
Context: When the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased significantly, the number of seals increased from 1.5 million to about 2.5 million.Some people think that seals have caused a decrease in cod, but seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can weaken the argument most strongly?
Choices:
  A: In the traditional cod fishing belt, a large number of seals caused great inconvenience to the fishing boat.
  B: The damage caused by seawater pollution to cod is more serious than that caused to seals.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean was greatly reduced.
  D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that seals may have caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that seawater pollution is more harmful to cod than seals, but it does not address the relationship between seals and cod.
  Option C suggests that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the number of seals increased, which does not support the argument.
  Option D suggests that cod and seals share the same food source, which could mean that seals may have contributed to the decline in the number of cod.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.

Topic: Logic
Context: Crimes involving the use of firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.However, most crimes involving the use of firearms did not result in homicides.Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
Question: The logic loophole in the above argument is most similar to the following one?
Choices:
  A: Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight.However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population.Therefore, in our country, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease.
  B: Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checkpoint.However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage of people are infected with AIDS.Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in the propaganda of AIDS prevention.
  C: The prevailing view is that smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer than not smoking.However, in some countries, the proportion of people with lung cancer who have a history of smoking is not higher than the proportion of the total population who have a history of smoking.Therefore, the above popular opinion is likely to be a prejudice.
  D: High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people.But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy.Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.

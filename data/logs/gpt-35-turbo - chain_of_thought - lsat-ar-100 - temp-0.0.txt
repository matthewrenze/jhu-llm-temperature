Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building

    - Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) with Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) with RealProp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions.
    - Option C: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) with Southco. This is not possible because Southco only owns one class 2 building.
    - Option D: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) with Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1) with RealProp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2).
    - Option E: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2) with Southco. Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Zimmer House (class 3) and the Garza Tower (class 1) with RealProp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions.

Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?

Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?

Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for all six sessions:
  Wednesday morning: Julio
  Wednesday afternoon: Lan
  Thursday morning: Olivia
  Thursday afternoon: Nessa
  Friday morning: Kevin
  Friday afternoon: Rebecca
  We can determine the lab assistant for all sessions except for Lan's and Kevin's.

Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai

  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao, so the possible positions for Stanton are 1, 2, 6, and 7.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be in position 2.
  If Quinn was in position 3, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  But this means that Stanton was recruited immediately after Tao, which is not possible.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited first or second.

Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?

  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:

  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited before Rovero.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either before Quinn or after Tao.

Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the original condition.
  This means that the new condition should also prevent M and N from being published in the same season.
  Choice A does not have the same effect as the original condition because it does not involve M and N.
  Choice B does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  Choice C does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and N.
  Choice E does not have the same effect as the original condition because it involves O and N, not M and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.

Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?

Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?

  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson

Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?

Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be fourth. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, J must be fourth and G must be first.
  This means Q must be third, and S must be either first or second.
  R cannot be seventh because G must be earlier than R.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:

  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be fourth. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.

Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:

Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can place F and M on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the same shelf as L. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so L must be on the bottom shelf.
  We are left with placing G and H on the remaining shelf, which can be either the middle or the top shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can place F and M on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf.

Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.

  Statement B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. This statement is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug with any other color due to Rule 4.
  Statement C: Peach is used in one of the rugs. This statement is true because peach is used in any rug in which olive is used according to Rule 2.
  Statement D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs. This statement is not necessarily true because turquoise can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs. This statement is not necessarily true because yellow may not be used in any of the rugs.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.

Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order of the slots must be Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Vegemite, Uneasy. This is not possible because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then the order of the slots must be Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Vegemite, Uneasy. This is possible because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot two, then the order of the slots must be Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite, Yardsign, Uneasy. This is not possible because Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then the order of the slots must be Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Vegemite, Uneasy. This is possible because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Zircon performs in slot four.

  Sports: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue
  This option violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  This option is not acceptable.
  
Therefore, the only acceptable selection of photographs is Option B:
  Lifestyle: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Sports: both photographs by Hue
  The answer is B.
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to select 6 photographs, exactly 2 photographs per section.
  There are 3 photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Let's check each option to see if it satisfies all the conditions.
  
Option A:
  Lifestyle: both photographs by Fuentes
  Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue
  Sports: one photograph by Gagnon and one by Hue
  Fuentes has both photographs in the Lifestyle section, which violates the condition that each photographer can have at most three photographs.
  This option is not acceptable.
  
Option B:
  Lifestyle: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Sports: both photographs by Hue
  This option satisfies all the conditions.
  This option is acceptable.

  Lifestyle: both photographs by Fuentes
  Metro: both photographs by Gagnon
  Sports: both photographs by Hue
  This option violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  This option is not acceptable.
  
Option D:
  Lifestyle: both photographs by Gagnon
  Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Sports: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue
  This option violates the condition that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  This option is not acceptable.
  
Option E:
  Lifestyle: one photograph by Gagnon and one by Hue
  Metro: both photographs by Hue
  Sports: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue
  This option violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  This option is not acceptable.
  
Therefore, the only acceptable selection of photographs is Option B:
  Lifestyle: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
  Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon

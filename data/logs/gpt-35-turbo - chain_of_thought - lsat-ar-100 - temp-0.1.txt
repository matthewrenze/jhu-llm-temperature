Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House

  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the companies must trade buildings of the same class or follow the rules above.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would have three class 2 buildings after the trade.
  Option C is possible. RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) and the Yates House (class 3) for the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option E is not possible because Trustcorp would have three class 3 buildings after the trade.

    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the companies must exchange buildings of the same class or follow the rules of the three kinds of trades.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building and the Ortiz Building (both class 2).
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) and Trustcorp can trade the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House and the Zimmer House (both class 3).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2).

  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To determine which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made, we need to consider the possible trades that can be made.
  The Garza Tower is the only class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is the only other class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Lynch Building is the only other class 2 building, so it can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Southco, where the Garza Tower is traded for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  In order to make a valid trade, the companies must exchange buildings of the same class or follow the rules of trades 2 and 3.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have to trade a class 1 building for a class 2 and a class 3 building.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp would have to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Option C is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have to trade a class 1 building for a class 2 and a class 3 building.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp would have to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade, each company must still own three buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for one company to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  The only class 1 building is the Garza Tower, and the only two class 2 buildings are the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Yates House and the Zimmer House, Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building, and Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2).
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.
  Let's consider each option:
    - Option A: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) with Southco. This is not possible because Southco only owns one class 1 building.
    - Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) with Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) with RealProp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions.
    - Option C: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) with Southco. Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) with RealProp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2).
    - Option D: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) with Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Flores Tower (class 1) with RealProp. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
    - Option E: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2) with Southco. Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Zimmer House (class 3) and the Garza Tower (class 1) with RealProp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Flores Tower; Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  In order to make a trade, the companies must have buildings of the same class.
  Therefore, RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower, and Southco can only trade the Flores Tower with the Garza Tower.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower, then Trustcorp must trade two class 2 buildings for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, the only possible option is:
  RealProp: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Garza Tower
  Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2. So, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. So, D is not possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. So, D is not possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. So, D is not possible.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 6, and W must be mentioned in chapter 3. So, X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7. 
  R can be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5.
  Therefore, the answer is B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.

  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 6 and 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4. 
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. 
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 2. But T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 6, then W must be mentioned in chapter 3. But T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. But S cannot be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, the order of clues mentioned is: R (chapter 1), T (chapter 3), U (chapter 3), X (chapter 4), W (chapter 6), S (chapter 5), Z (chapter 7).

Response 9:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. Therefore, R, S, T, W, and Z must be mentioned in the remaining chapters: 2, 5, 6, and 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  The only remaining clues are R, S, and Z. Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, one of them must be mentioned in chapter 2, and the other must be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  The only choice that satisfies these conditions is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.

  Choice B violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Choice C satisfies all the conditions and is a possible order of the auditions.

Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five

Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for all sessions except for the Wednesday afternoon session.
  The lab assistant for the Wednesday afternoon session could be either Lan or Olivia.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for 5 out of the 6 sessions.
  The answer is E: five.

  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for all six sessions:
  Wednesday morning: Julio
  Wednesday afternoon: Lan
  Thursday morning: Olivia
  Thursday afternoon: Nessa
  Friday morning: Kevin
  Friday afternoon: Rebecca
  We can determine the lab assistant for all sessions except for Lan's and Kevin's.
  Therefore, the answer is C: three.

  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead a session on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Therefore, Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session because Lan or Olivia must lead that session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Therefore, Lan's session must be on Wednesday.
  We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, so we can determine the lab assistant for the Wednesday morning, Wednesday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon sessions.
  We cannot determine the lab assistant for the Thursday morning or the Thursday afternoon sessions.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for four of the six sessions.

  Therefore, Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session because Lan or Olivia must lead that session.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Thursday.
  Therefore, Lan's session must be on Friday.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday.
  Therefore, we know the schedule for all the lab assistants except for one.
  Therefore, the answer is D: four.

  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for each session as follows:
  Wednesday morning: Julio
  Wednesday afternoon: Lan
  Thursday morning: Olivia
  Thursday afternoon: ?
  Friday morning: Kevin or Rebecca
  Friday afternoon: Nessa
  We can determine the lab assistant for the Friday afternoon session, which is Nessa.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for a total of 4 sessions (Julio, Lan, Olivia, and Nessa).
Action: Answer("D")

  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead a session on either Wednesday or Friday.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  Therefore, the lab assistants and their sessions are as follows:
  Wednesday morning: Lan or Olivia
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  Thursday morning: One of the remaining assistants
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Olivia or Lan
  Friday afternoon: Nessa

  Therefore, Nessa cannot lead the Wednesday afternoon session because Lan or Olivia must lead that session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia must lead a session on Friday.
  Therefore, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday.
  The remaining lab assistant, Nessa, must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, for each of the lab assistants, we can determine which session they lead except for one.
  The answer is A: one.

Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.

  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be first or second.
  If Holden's lecture is first, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be second and fourth, respectively.
  If Holden's lecture is second, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be third and fourth, respectively.
  If Garcia's lecture is third, then Holden's lecture must be first and Jiang's lecture must be fourth.

Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one of them gives which lecture.
  If oil paintings is the first lecture, then watercolors must be the third lecture, and lithographs must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the sculptures lecture, and Garcia must give the oil paintings lecture. This means that choice B is true.
  If sculptures is the second lecture, then oil paintings must be the first lecture, and lithographs must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the watercolors lecture, and Jiang must give the sculptures lecture. This means that choice E is true.
  Therefore, either choice B or choice E could be true.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 2:

  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, Farley gives the first lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. True, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and Garcia's lecture must be third or fourth.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. False, Garcia must give the oil paintings or the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. False, Holden gives the second lecture, which must be the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. True, Jiang must give the last lecture, which must be the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.

  If Farley's lecture is third, then Garcia's lecture must be fourth and Jiang's lecture must be first, but this would violate the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be third.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden's lecture must be first and Farley's lecture must be second, but this would violate the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be first and Farley's lecture must be second, but this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Farley's lecture must be first and Garcia's lecture must be second, but this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  The only remaining option is that Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one of them gives which lecture.
  If oil paintings is the first lecture, then watercolors must be the third lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  If sculptures is the first lecture, then oil paintings must be the second lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  If sculptures is the first lecture, then watercolors must be the third lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the watercolors lecture.
  If sculptures is the first lecture, then lithographs must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Jiang must give the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be second.
  Garcia and Jiang's lectures must be third and fourth, but we don't know which is which.
  Let's check each choice:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, Farley gives the first lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. True, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second and Garcia's lecture must be third or fourth.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. False, Garcia must give the third or fourth lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. False, Holden gives the second lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. True, Jiang must give the fourth lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  If Holden's lecture is the first lecture, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one is second and which one is fourth.
  If oil paintings is the first lecture, then sculptures must be the second lecture. However, this violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the order of the lectures is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the sculptures lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture, and Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one is second and which one is fourth.
  If Garcia's lecture is the second lecture, then Jiang's lecture must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Jiang's lecture must be the lithographs lecture.
  If Jiang's lecture is the fourth lecture, then Garcia's lecture must be the second lecture. Therefore, Garcia's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, either Farley gives the sculptures lecture or Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.

Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be represented by at least one panelist each.
  There are three botanists, and if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, either one botanist and one chemist are selected, or one botanist and two chemists are selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected.
  Therefore, A and B are not necessarily true.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K because K is the only chemist that satisfies the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, C is true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then M cannot be selected because K and M cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, D is true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then G can still be selected because there are three botanists to choose from.
  Therefore, E is not necessarily true.

Response 7:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, M cannot be selected.
  Therefore, K and L must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected.
  Therefore, B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected must be true.

  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to consider each option and see if it violates any of the given conditions.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then Kim would have to work in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Mahr, then there would be no way to assign Parra and Tiao/Udall to the remaining two sales zones without violating the given conditions.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall would have to work in Zone 1, which would violate the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then Parra would have to work in Zone 2, which would violate the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Udall, then Tiao would have to work in Zone 2, which would violate the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Mahr.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  From the given conditions, we also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall.
  From the given conditions, we also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Tiao because they are already assigned to Zones 1 and 2.
  The only remaining option is Udall.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  The answer is E: Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we have the following possibilities:
  - Parra is in Zone 1, Quinn is in Zone 1, Tiao is in Zone 3, Udall is in Zone 2, and Stuckey, Kim, and Mahr are in Zone 3.
  - Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall is in Zone 3, Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3, and Stuckey, Kim, and Mahr are in Zone 3.
  In both possibilities, Quinn is in Zone 1 with Parra.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, Stuckey, Kim, Mahr, or Udall.

  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall must be in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Parra must be in Zone 2 and Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall must be in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Parra must be in Zone 3 and Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall must be in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")

  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Tiao is in Zone 1 and Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao, Stuckey, or Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 2.
  The remaining sales representative, Parra, works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  The answer is A: Kim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we have two possible scenarios:
  Scenario 1: Parra is in Zone 1 and Quinn is in Zone 1. In this case, Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are left to be assigned to Zones 2 and 3. Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
  Scenario 2: Tiao is in Zone 2 and Udall is in Zone 3. In this case, Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, and Stuckey are left to be assigned to Zones 1 and 3. Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")

Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment for Tao and Stanton is:
  [Tao, ?, ?, Stanton, ?, ?, ?] or [?, ?, ?, Stanton, ?, ?, Tao]
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, Villas, White]
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited first.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is:
  [?, Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, Tao]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited second.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Stanton, ?, ?, ?, Tao]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited third.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, ?, ?, Stanton, ?, Tao]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, ?, ?, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Therefore, Stanton could NOT have been recruited fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, Stanton]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, ?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton]
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited seventh.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining four accomplices.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth because Tao is either immediately before or after Stanton.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao would be recruited second or seventh, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao would be recruited first or third, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited fourth, then Tao would be recruited third or fifth, which is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Tao would be recruited fifth or seventh, which is not possible.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth because Tao is either second or fourth.
  The only option left is that Stanton was recruited first or seventh.
  Therefore, the answer is E: seventh.
Action: Answer("E")

  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Stanton are 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th.
  Stanton could have been recruited third, immediately after Quinn, but not immediately before Tao.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, Stanton could not have been recruited third.

Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and K must be placed on the top shelf.
  We also know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and M must be placed on the same shelf as each other, since they are the only books left and there must be at least two books on each shelf.
  The answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G and H must be placed on the top shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then H must be placed on the top shelf and M must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then K and O must be placed on the top shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  Therefore, none of the statements must be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and K must be on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be on the top shelf with F and K.
  Therefore, G and H must be on the same shelf as each other on the middle or bottom shelf.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and K must be placed on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be placed on the top shelf with F and K.
  Therefore, G and H must be placed on the same shelf as each other on the bottom shelf.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G and H must be placed on the top shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then H must be placed on the top shelf and M must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  If K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then K and O must be placed on the top shelf, which means L cannot be placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices must be true.

  Therefore, the other one (not working in Zone 1) must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We have already determined that Udall and Stuckey work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  We have already determined that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  The only option that includes Udall, Stuckey, and Parra is E.

  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3.
  Also, neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, but neither of them can work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Since Tiao cannot work in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1.
  Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn.
  However, we also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.

  We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, if Tiao is not in Zone 3, then Udall must be in Zone 3.
  We also know that there are exactly seven sales representatives.
  Therefore, the remaining sales representatives must be in Zone 3.
  The only combination of sales representatives that satisfies all the given conditions is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use the schedule to determine which batches are being referred to.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday and the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday.
  This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Using this information, we can determine that:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True)
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule for the week.
  Oatmeal cookies: 1st batch on Monday, 2nd batch on Wednesday, 3rd batch on Friday.
  Peanut butter cookies: 1st batch on Tuesday, 2nd batch on Monday, 3rd batch on Thursday.
  Sugar cookies: 1st batch on Wednesday, 2nd batch on Thursday, 3rd batch on Friday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it must be oatmeal cookies' 1st batch and sugar cookies' 3rd batch.
  Therefore, oatmeal cookies' 1st batch is made on Friday.
  This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, and it could be sugar cookies' 3rd batch or oatmeal cookies' 3rd batch.
  So, the statement that could be false is E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use a table to organize the information.
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    |         |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         |               |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         |               |       |
| Friday    |         |               |       |

  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  
  Let's start filling in the table:
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    |         |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         |               |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         |               | 2     |
| Friday    |         |               | 1     |

  We know that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. This means that either the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday or the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. Let's consider both possibilities:
  
  Possibility 1: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday.
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    |         |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         |               |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  | 1       |               | 2     |
| Friday    |         |               | 1     |

  We can see that:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  
  Therefore, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then all of the statements could be true, and the answer is None of the Above.
  
  Possibility 2: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | 1       |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         |               |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         | 1             | 2     |
| Friday    |         |               | 1     |

  We can see that:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (the first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday).
  - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  
  Therefore, if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then statement C (Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday) could be false, and the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule for the week.
  Oatmeal cookies: M, W, F
  Peanut butter cookies: T, Th, Sa
  Sugar cookies: M, T, Th
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it must be oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Friday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, which makes choice C false.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, five, or six, then Wellspring must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot one or two, then Zircon must perform in slot two or three, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot four or five, and Wellspring must perform in slot three.

Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that M and F must be placed on the same shelf, and that I must be placed on a different shelf. 
  We also know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so there must be at least two books on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so we cannot have just one book on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that M and F must be on the same shelf, and that shelf cannot be the top shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that K and O must be on different shelves, and both cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that I must be on a different shelf than F and M.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that H cannot be on the bottom shelf because there are at least two books on each shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that G cannot be on the bottom shelf because there are at least two books on each shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is L and O.
  The answer is E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that M and F must be placed on the same shelf, and that K, O, L, I, G, and H must be placed on the other two shelves.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that includes F and M on the same shelf and has at least two books on the bottom shelf is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that I must be on the middle shelf, and K and O must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  The only option that has at least three books on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We need to find a list of books that could be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the given options, we can eliminate options C and E because they do not have enough books to be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Option A has only two books, which means that the top shelf will have more books than the bottom shelf, which is not possible.
  Option B has three books, which means that the middle shelf will have only two books, but we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so this option is also not possible.
  Option D has four books, which means that the top shelf will have two books, the middle shelf will have one book, and the bottom shelf will have three books. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that:
    - M and F are on the same shelf, and it is not the top shelf.
    - K is on the top shelf, and F is not on the top shelf.
    - O is on the top shelf, and L is not on the top shelf.
    - I is on the middle shelf.
    - More books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that:
    - The top shelf has two books, K and O.
    - The middle shelf has one book, I.
    - The bottom shelf has five books, F, G, H, L, and M.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so neither O nor L can be on the bottom shelf if F and M are on the same shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that M and F must be on the same shelf, and that shelf cannot be the top shelf.
  We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only book that could be on the bottom shelf is L.
  Since we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, we can eliminate choices A and B.
  We can also eliminate choice C because none of the books listed are on the same shelf as I.
  We can eliminate choice D because it includes O, which we know is on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, the answer is E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")

Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Therefore, we need to find a condition that also ensures that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Choice A does not affect M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice B does not affect M and N either, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice C affects M and P, not M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  This condition ensures that M and N cannot be published in the same season, just like the original condition.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.

Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1, 3, or 4.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1, 2, or 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Isaacs's watercolor is displayed.
  This means that Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1, because Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4.
  Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on different walls.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2, because Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3, and Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 3.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting on wall 2.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so the painting on wall 2 cannot be by Isaacs.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so the painting on wall 2 cannot be by Franz.
  Therefore, the painting on wall 2 must be by either Greene or Hidalgo.
  If the painting on wall 2 is by Greene, then Hidalgo's paintings must be on walls 1 and 4, which means that Isaacs's watercolor would be on wall 3, violating the conditions.
  Therefore, the painting on wall 2 must be by Hidalgo.
  The answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce the following:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 1 or 4 because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4 in the lower position.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 1 because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Hidalgo's paintings cannot be both oil or both watercolor because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1 and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  However, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then wall 1 must have a painting by Greene or Hidalgo.
  However, wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, wall 1 must have a painting by Greene or Hidalgo that is not painted by Franz or Isaacs.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is Hidalgo's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 1.
  Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 3 and 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.
  The answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls 1, 2, or 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then wall 4 must have Isaacs's oil and wall 3 must have Greene's watercolor.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 3.
  Since no wall can have only watercolors, then wall 1 must have either Franz's watercolor or Greene's oil.
  However, wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we can deduce the following:
  - Isaacs's oil is not on wall 2 because he already has his oil on wall 4.
  - Franz's watercolor is not on wall 3 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is not on wall 3 because it is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Hidalgo's watercolor is not on wall 2 because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, the only option left is Hidalgo's oil, which must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls 1, 2, or 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then wall 4 must have Isaacs's oil and wall 3 must have Greene's watercolor in the lower position.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, so Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 1, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 2.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 4, then Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 2 or wall 3.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.

Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be Xue.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue.
  The only common factor in all of these cases is that Quinn must be selected.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  The answer is C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, and the constraint is violated.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, and the constraint is violated.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are still four workers to choose from, and the constraint is not violated.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be selected, and the constraint is not violated.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells can be selected, and the constraint is not violated.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
Response 0:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the only possible order for the businesses is: pharmacy, optometrist or veterinarian, restaurant, toy store, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian or optometrist. The only option that follows this order is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must occupy spaces 1 and 7, respectively.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant in space 7 must be separated from the other restaurant by at least two businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must occupy space 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot occupy space 5.
  Therefore, the only possible order of the businesses is A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant at the other end of the row must be separated from the first restaurant by at least two businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be at one of the ends of the row. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be at the other end of the row. 
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively is: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, veterinarian, restaurant.
  The answer is A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the restaurant at the other end of the row must be separated by at least three businesses from the first restaurant. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  From the choices, only option B satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the restaurant cannot be in space 2 or 6. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 3 or 5. From these constraints, we can eliminate choices A, C, and D. The only remaining choice that satisfies all the constraints is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must occupy spaces 1 and 7, but we don't know which one is at which end.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at an end must be in either space 3 or 5.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must occupy space 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot occupy space 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  We can use these deductions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Choice A is eliminated because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Choice B is a possible order that satisfies all the constraints.
  Choice C is eliminated because the pharmacy is not at an end.
  Choice D is eliminated because the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Choice E is eliminated because the pharmacy is not at an end.
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the order of the businesses must be one of the following:
  1. pharmacy, optometrist, veterinarian, restaurant, shoe store, toy store, restaurant
  2. pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, restaurant, shoe store, toy store, restaurant
  We can eliminate option A because the toy store is next to the veterinarian. We can eliminate option C because the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses. We can eliminate option D because the toy store is next to the restaurant. Therefore, the answer is either option B or option E. We can check that option B satisfies all the constraints, but option E violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the order of the businesses must be either:
  pharmacy, optometrist, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  or
  restaurant, toy store, veterinarian, shoe store, restaurant, optometrist, pharmacy
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the first option is not possible because the pharmacy is not next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the second option is not possible because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the answer is D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at the ends of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  From the choices, we can see that only option B satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must occupy spaces 1 and 7, but we don't know which one is at which end.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at the end must be in either space 3 or 4.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot be in space 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  We can then try to place the remaining businesses in the remaining spaces, making sure that the constraints are satisfied.
  After trying all the answer choices, we find that only answer choice B satisfies all the constraints.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later and Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  R can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters.
  Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.

  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.

Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction days for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd or later, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or later as well.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - Choice A: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  - Choice C: The vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  - Choice E: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the harmonica and lamp must be auctioned before the mirror, and there are only four days left after June 2nd for the harmonica and lamp to be auctioned.
  This leaves us with two possible answer choices:
  - Choice B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. In this case, the harmonica must also be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. The table could be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase could be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This is a valid scenario.
  - Choice D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. In this case, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd as well. The table could be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase could be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This is also a valid scenario.
  Therefore, either choice B or choice D could be true.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction days for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Now, we can check each choice to see which one could be true:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd. The vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. 
Action: Answer("E")

Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction days for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Now, we can check each choice to see which one could be true.
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible because the lamp can be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the mirror can be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase and the sundial can be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. So, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. So, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - A: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on that day.
  - C: The vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial and the mirror must be auctioned on earlier dates.
  - E: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  We are left with two possible answer choices:
  - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. In this case, the harmonica and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or 5th, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. In this case, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or 5th, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, either B or D could be true.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, then the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the lamp could not be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.

  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. So, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Now, we can check each choice to see if it is possible.
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.

  Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E.
  The only possible dates for the lamp are June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, which violates the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, which violates the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 4th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, which violates the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd and 4th in some order.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction days for each antique.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - Sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - Table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We can use these conditions to create a timeline of the auction days for each antique.
  We can then check which of the given options is possible based on the timeline.
  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. 
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th or later, then the mirror cannot be auctioned before the lamp, which violates one of the given conditions.
    Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd.
    The table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    The sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or later, which means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
    Therefore, option B is possible.
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd.
    The table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
    The sundial must be auctioned on June 5th or later, which means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 6th.
    Therefore, option D is possible.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, which means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or later.
    If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    The table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
    The sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, which is not possible because the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
    Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible option is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings in return.
  If RealProp trades the Yates House or the Zimmer House, it must receive one building of the same class in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it must receive one building of the same class or two class 2 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building or the Meyer Building, it must receive one building of the same class or two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building, it must receive one building of the same class or two class 2 buildings in return.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building.
  B can be true because RealProp can trade the Yates House or the Zimmer House for the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building.
  D can be true because Trustcorp can trade the Flores Tower for the Yates House.
  E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades any of its buildings, it can only trade it for one building of the same class.
  Therefore, the buildings owned by RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp cannot be mixed up.
  A cannot be true because the buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot include the Yates House (class 3) owned by RealProp.
  B cannot be true because the buildings owned by Southco cannot include the Meyer Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp.
  C cannot be true because the buildings owned by Southco cannot include the King Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp.
  D cannot be true because the buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot include the Yates House (class 3) owned by RealProp.
  E can be true because the Garza Tower (class 1) is owned by RealProp and the Lynch Building (class 2) is owned by Southco.
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it must receive two class 3 buildings or one class 2 building in return.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House cannot be traded for the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building because they are all class 2 or class 3 buildings.
  Also, the Garza Tower cannot be traded for the Meyer Building because they are not of the same class.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, no matter how many trades are made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If RealProp trades the Yates House or the Zimmer House, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it can only trade it for one class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades any of its buildings, it can only trade it for one building of the same class.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because Southco can trade the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because Southco does not own any of these buildings.)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. (Impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (Possible because Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the Garza Tower and the Ortiz Building for the Lynch Building.)

Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E because they do not have enough photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A is not valid because Frost and Heideck cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony. We have three photographers left: Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, we cannot assign both Lai and Mays to the Silva University ceremony.
  Based on the given constraints, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Heideck, and Knutson.

Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?

  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton
  2. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, Stanton, White
  3. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, White, Villas, Stanton
  4. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, White, Rovero, Villas, Stanton

Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be first. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, which means R must be seventh. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be fourth and G must be first.
  The only answer choice that matches this conclusion is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be first. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, which means R must be seventh. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be fourth and G must be first.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If S is second, then Q must be first, which means G must be second, and J must be third. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be third.
  The answer is B: J is third.

  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be fourth and G must be first.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, and R must be fifth or sixth. This means G, H, and J must be second, fourth, or seventh. However, J must be earlier than G, which means J cannot be second. Therefore, S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, and R must be fourth or fifth. This means G, H, and J must be first, sixth, or seventh. However, J must be earlier than G, which means J cannot be seventh. Therefore, S cannot be second.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, and R must be fourth or fifth. This means G, H, and J must be second, sixth, or seventh. However, J must be earlier than G, which means J cannot be seventh. Therefore, S must be third, and Q must be first.
  Therefore, Q is first if Y is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")

Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:

  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Therefore, Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, A is not necessarily true.
  Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, D is true.
  Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a voicemail target that is longer than its website target.
  If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a voicemail target that is longer than its website target.
  Therefore, C is true.
  Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other two photographs in the Metro and Sports sections must be taken by Gagnon, Fuentes, or Hue.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there will be no photograph left for Fuentes to take in the Sports section.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there will be no photograph left for Gagnon to take in the Lifestyle section.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then there will be no photograph left for Fuentes to take in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there will be no photograph by Fuentes or Hue in the Metro section, which violates the constraint.
  If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  We need to find a selection that satisfies all the given conditions.
  Let's go through each option:
    A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson
      If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. But this option includes both Myers and Paine, which violates the given condition. So, this option is not possible.
    B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre
      This option does not include at least four employees. So, this option is not possible.
    C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre
      If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, this option violates the given condition. So, this option is not possible.
    D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre
      If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. This option includes both Schmidt and Thomson, which satisfies the given condition. Also, this option includes Yoder, which satisfies the condition for Wong. Therefore, this option is possible.
    E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre
      This option includes Wong, which satisfies the condition for Myers and Yoder. Also, this option includes Thomson, which satisfies the condition for Schmidt. Therefore, this option is possible.

Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there must be at least 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at least 1 sales representative working in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then there are at most 3 sales representatives working in the same sales zone as Parra and Udall.
  Therefore, the only possible configuration that satisfies the given conditions is that 2 sales representatives work in Zone 1, 1 sales representative works in Zone 2, and 4 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then either 2 or 1 sales representative works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Zone 3 must have at least 3 sales representatives.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other one must work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then they cannot both work in Zone 1 because that would mean there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 3 because that would mean there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, a contradiction.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, which means there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, a contradiction.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall both work in Zone 3, which means there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, a contradiction.
  Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall both work in Zone 3, which means there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, a contradiction.
  Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey also works in Zone 3, which means there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, a contradiction.
  Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  The only remaining possibility is that Quinn and Parra work in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 2. This means there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3 and 1 sales representative in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This means there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 3 and 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra could work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1. This means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1. Therefore, there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Stuckey works in Zone 3. This means there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 3 and 3 sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
  The only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Parra works in the same sales zone as Quinn, and Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 1 along with at least two other sales representatives. 
  This means that Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 2 along with at least one other sales representative. 
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 3 along with at least two other sales representatives.
  This means that Mahr and Kim must work in Zone 1, and Quinn must work in the same sales zone as Parra and the other sales representatives in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are either 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then Parra and Quinn are either in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey and Udall are either in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 1 and at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, then there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but not both. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 1 as well. This means that only Kim and Mahr can work in Zone 2 and both must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1.
  The only choice that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 is either 2 or 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey also works in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2. This is not possible.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3. This is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Kim works in Zone 2 or B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 and either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3, 4, 5, or 6 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. This means that Parra must work in Zone 3. Therefore, there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, which satisfies the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. This also means that Stuckey works in Zone 3. From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn also works in Zone 3. This leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 2 and Zone 1, respectively.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 is either 1 or 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then at least three sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E: Udall works in Zone 3.

Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:

  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test J on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Therefore, Theresa cannot test G on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day.
  Seamus tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test H on the second day.
  Based on the above deductions, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must test H on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test F or G on the first day.
  If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the second day. But this is not possible because Yuki cannot test J on the first day, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests F on the first day, and Seamus tests H on the first day.
  On the second day, Yuki tests G, and Seamus tests J.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test J on the first day.
  On the second day, Yuki cannot test J, so Reynaldo must test J.
  Theresa must test H, so she cannot test G.
  Therefore, Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G.
  The only remaining option is that Yuki tests H on the second day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We are given no information about which students can or cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to determine which three of these students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give morning reports on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  - Helen, George, and Nina (if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday)
  - Irving, Robert, and Helen (if Nina gives a report on Wednesday)
  - Robert, George, and Helen (if Nina does not give a report)
  Out of these options, the only one that appears in the choices is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find three people who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six people left.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If Helen, George, and Nina give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give a morning report, so this choice is not possible.
  B: If Irving, Robert, and Helen give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give a morning report, so this choice is not possible.
  C: If Nina, Helen, and Olivia give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give a morning report, so this choice is not possible.
  D: If Olivia, Robert, and Irving give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George can give a morning report, and on Wednesday, Nina can give a morning report, so this choice is possible.
  E: If Robert, George, and Helen give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give a morning report, so this choice is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Action: Answer("D")

  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left.
  We can use the given conditions to create a table to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots.
  
| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| --------- |:----------------:| ----------:|
| Monday    | ?                | ?          |
| Tuesday   | George           | ?          |
| Wednesday | ?                | ?          |

  We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  
| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| --------- |:----------------:| ----------:|
| Monday    | Robert or Olivia | ?          |
| Tuesday   | George           | ?          |
| Wednesday | Robert or Olivia | ?          |

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday, so they must give reports on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Monday, so they must give reports on Tuesday.
  
| Day       | Morning           | Afternoon  |
| --------- |:----------------:| ----------:|
| Monday    | Robert or Olivia | Nina       |
| Tuesday   | George           | Helen, Irving or Robert, Olivia |
| Wednesday | Helen, Irving or Robert, Olivia | Nina |

  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, Robert or Olivia, and Helen, Irving or Robert, or Olivia.
  The answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, under the given conditions.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  Let's consider each choice:
    A: Helen, George, and Nina
      If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
    B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
      This choice is possible because none of the conditions are violated.
    C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
      If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
    D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
      This choice is possible because none of the conditions are violated.
    E: Robert, George, and Helen
      If George gives a report on Tuesday, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  The possible choices are B and D.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find a combination of three students for each day, where each student gives a morning report.
  We can start by checking the choices one by one.
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
    If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
    If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    But we cannot find a third student who can give a report on Wednesday morning, because Olivia and Robert cannot give a morning report.
    Therefore, A is not a possible combination.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
    If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
    If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    We can find a third student who can give a report on Wednesday morning, which is either Olivia or George.
    Therefore, B is a possible combination.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
    If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
    If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    But we cannot find a third student who can give a report on Wednesday morning, because Robert cannot give a morning report.
    Therefore, C is not a possible combination.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
    If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
    If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    But we cannot find a third student who can give a report on Wednesday morning, because Helen and George cannot give a morning report.
    Therefore, D is not a possible combination.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
    If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
    If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
    We can find a third student who can give a report on Wednesday morning, which is either Olivia or Nina.
    Therefore, E is a possible combination.
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving, Robert, and Helen (B) or Robert, George, and Helen (E).
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find three people who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six people left.
  We can try to use the conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But if Helen gives a report on Tuesday, then Irving must also give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday. Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, this means that George must give a report on Tuesday afternoon. Therefore, George cannot give a report on Monday morning. This leaves us with four people: George, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina.
  We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  - Helen, Nina, and Robert
  - Irving, Nina, and Olivia
  - Nina, George, and Olivia
  - Olivia, George, and Helen
  Out of these choices, only one satisfies the conditions that George can only give a report on Tuesday and Olivia cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, under the given conditions.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  Let's consider each choice:
    A: Helen, George, and Nina
      If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But we need a student who can give a morning report on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
    B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
      This choice is valid because none of the given conditions are violated.
    C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
      If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But we need a student who can give a morning report on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
    D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
      This choice is valid because none of the given conditions are violated.
    E: Robert, George, and Helen
      If George gives a report on Tuesday, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But we need a student who can give a morning report on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, this choice is not valid.
  The only valid choice is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left.
  We can use the conditions to eliminate some possibilities and find the answer.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday. She must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  If Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, then they must give morning reports. Therefore, they cannot give reports on the same day.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some possibilities and find the answer.
  The only possible combination is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, under the given conditions.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
     If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
     This option is possible. If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then this option is still possible.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
     If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
     This option is not possible because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
     This option is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to consider the given conditions and determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday, and it must be in the morning.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on the following day, which means they cannot give morning reports on Monday or Tuesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that:
  - George must give a report on Tuesday morning.
  - Olivia and Robert must give their reports in the morning.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give morning reports on Monday or Tuesday.
  - If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give their reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
  - A: Helen, George, and Nina (Helen cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday)
  - B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (possible if Nina's report is given on Wednesday)
  - C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (possible if Nina's report is given on Monday or Tuesday)
  - D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (possible)
  - E: Robert, George, and Helen (Helen cannot give a report on Monday or Tuesday if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday)
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.

Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on the top or middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the top shelf if F and M are on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is also on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F on the other shelf with I and M, and we can place K, G, L, and O on the remaining shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F and M on the other shelf with K and G, and we can place I, L, and O on the remaining shelf.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place M on the other shelf with L and F, and we can place I, K, G, and O on the remaining shelf.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F on the other shelf with M and H, and we can place I, K, G, L, and O on the remaining shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F, M, and L on one shelf, and we can place I, K, G, and O on the remaining shelf.
  Only one of these options fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  Therefore, the answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, then M must be placed on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top or middle shelf, and F must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top or middle shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can place 3 books on the bottom shelf, 3 books on the middle shelf, and 2 books on the top shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with F, and we can place K and O on the top shelf, and L and G on the bottom shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with O, and we can place F, I, and M on the middle shelf, and L and H on the bottom shelf.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the bottom shelf with G, and we can place K and O on the top shelf, and I and M on the middle shelf.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with I and F, and we can place K and O on the top shelf, and L and G on the bottom shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with K, and we can place F, I, and M on the middle shelf, and L and G on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can place at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F on the other shelf and K, L, and O on the remaining shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F and M on the top shelf, I on the middle shelf, and K, G, L, and O on the bottom shelf.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place M on the other shelf and K, I, L, and O on the remaining shelf.

  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, then M must be placed on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the middle shelf, then K must be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is on the top or middle shelf, then O must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf as well.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with F and K on the top and bottom shelves respectively.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with F and M on the middle and bottom shelves respectively.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with I and K on the top and bottom shelves respectively.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with F and K on the middle and bottom shelves respectively.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the bottom shelf with F and K on the top and middle shelves respectively.

  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, then M must be placed on the same shelf. If we place F on the middle shelf, then M must be placed on the top or bottom shelf. 
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the middle shelf, then K must be on the bottom shelf. If F is on the bottom shelf, then K can be on either the middle or top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is on the top or middle shelf, then O must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the bottom shelf, then O can be on any shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can't have only one book on the bottom shelf.
  Let's try to place G and H. If G and H are on the same shelf, then they can't be on the middle shelf since I is already there. If they are on the top shelf, then we can only place one more book on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf. Therefore, G and H must be on the bottom shelf.
  Now we can try to place the remaining books based on the conditions we have. If F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle or bottom shelf, but we already have G and H on the bottom shelf, so K must be on the top shelf. Then, M must be on the top or bottom shelf, but we already have F on the top shelf, so M must be on the bottom shelf. Then, L must be on the top shelf and O must be on the middle shelf. This satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that will fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

  Therefore, the only statement that will fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined which shelf each book is placed on.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, the placement of the other books is still determined.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, the placement of the other books is still determined.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, the placement of the other books is still determined.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, the placement of the other books is still determined.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, the placement of the other books is still determined.

Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
  If H is fourth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the articles is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the articles is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the articles is not fully determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J must be earlier than R.
  Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance. Therefore, H must be either first, second, fifth, or sixth.
  Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition. Therefore, R must be either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S must be either first or second.
  S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, Y must be either sixth or seventh.
  If H is first, then the second article must be either Q or R. However, if Q is second, then S cannot be earlier than Q. Therefore, H cannot be first.
  If H is second, then the first article must be either Q or R. If Q is first, then S cannot be earlier than Q. Therefore, H cannot be second.
  If H is fifth, then the fourth article must be either Q or R. If Q is fourth, then S cannot be earlier than Q. Therefore, H cannot be fifth.
  If H is sixth, then the fourth article must be either Q or R. If Q is fourth, then S can be earlier than Q. Therefore, H can be sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first article must be either S or Y. However, if Y is first, then S cannot be earlier than Y. Therefore, R cannot be fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the first article must be either S or Y. If Y is first, then S cannot be earlier than Y. Therefore, R cannot be seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the first article must be either S or R. However, if R is first, then J cannot be earlier than G. Therefore, Y cannot be fifth.
  The only remaining answer choice is B: H is sixth. If H is sixth, then the fourth article must be either Q or R. If Q is fourth, then S can be earlier than Q. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that G must be edited after J and before R.
  We know that Q must be edited after H.
  We know that S must be edited before Y.
  We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be edited before Y, and Q must be third. This means that R must be edited sixth, and G must be edited seventh. This leaves H and J to be edited first and second, but we don't know which order they should be edited in.
  If H is fourth, then the order could be H, Q, S, Y, R, J, G or H, Q, S, R, Y, J, G.
  If H is sixth, then the order could be J, G, R, Q, S, H, Y or J, G, R, S, Q, H, Y.
  If R is fourth, then the order could be S, Q, H, J, G, R, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order could be H, Q, S, Y, J, G, R.
  Therefore, the only option that fully determines the order of the articles is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
  If H is fourth, then the order could be H, Q, S, Y, G, J, R or H, R, G, J, Q, S, Y.
  If H is sixth, then the order could be Q, S, Y, G, J, H, R or R, G, J, Q, S, Y, H.
  If R is fourth, then the order could be S, Q, H, Y, G, J, R.
  If R is seventh, then the order could be S, Q, Y, G, J, H, R.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to create a partial order of the articles:
  J < G < R
  S < Q
  Y > S
  We can use this partial order to eliminate some of the answer choices:
  If H is fourth, then the only remaining articles are Q, R, and Y. However, we cannot determine the order of these articles.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the articles must be S, Q, H, G, J, R, Y.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the articles must be J, G, H, R, Q, S, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the articles must be S, Q, R, G, H, J, Y.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the articles must be S, Q, R, G, Y, J, H.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. However, this means that S is earlier than Q, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. The fourth article cannot be G or J, so it must be Y. Then, the fifth article must be either G or J, and the last article must be either G or R. This satisfies all the conditions, so B could be the answer.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. The fourth article cannot be G or J, so it must be one of the nutrition articles, R. Then, the fifth article must be one of the finance articles, and the last two articles must be the remaining finance and wildlife articles. This satisfies all the conditions, so C could be the answer.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. The fourth article must be one of the finance articles, and the fifth article must be one of the nutrition articles. Then, the sixth article must be the remaining finance article, and the last article must be the remaining nutrition article. This satisfies all the conditions, so D could be the answer.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G or J. Then, the fifth article must be Y, and the last two articles must be the remaining finance and nutrition articles. However, we cannot determine whether G or J is edited before the other, so E is not the answer.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C or D.
Action: Answer("B or C or D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. But then we cannot edit any of the finance articles next, violating the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the fourth and fifth articles must be G and J, in some order. But then we cannot edit Y last, violating the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, B is not the answer.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then G and J must be edited next, in some order, and finally H. This satisfies all the conditions, so C could be the answer.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, in that order. Then G and J must be edited next, in some order, and finally H. This satisfies all the conditions, so D could be the answer.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J, in some order. But then we cannot edit R next, violating the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, E is not the answer.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
  If H is fourth, then the order could be G, R, Q, S, H, J, Y or J, G, R, Q, S, H, Y.
  If H is sixth, then the order could be S, Q, R, G, J, H, Y or Q, S, R, G, J, H, Y.
  If R is fourth, then the order could be S, Q, G, R, H, J, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order could be S, Q, G, H, J, R, Y.
  The only option that fully determines the order of the articles is if S is first, Q is third, and R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. However, this means that S is earlier than Q, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the fourth and fifth articles must be G and J in some order. However, this means that the sixth article must be H, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, B is not the answer.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. However, this means that S is earlier than Y, which violates one of the conditions. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, and the fourth and fifth articles must be G and J in some order. However, this means that the sixth article must be either H or R, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J in some order. However, this means that the fifth article must be H, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, E is not the answer.
  The only answer choice that we have not eliminated is B. If H is sixth, then the order of the articles must be Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J. This order satisfies all of the given conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means that J, G, and R must be edited in that order.
  S must be earlier than Y. This means that S and Y must be edited in that order.
  Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition. This means that the order of editing the nutrition articles must be Q, R, and S.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. This means that the order of editing the finance articles must be H and then either G or J.
  We can now use the remaining answer choices to determine the order of editing the articles.
  If H is fourth, then the order of editing the finance articles would be H, G, and J. However, this would mean that S is earlier than Q, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.
  If H is sixth, then the order of editing the finance articles would be G, H, and J. However, this would mean that R is fourth, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.
  If R is fourth, then the order of editing the nutrition articles would be Q, R, and S. This means that S is earlier than Q, which violates the given conditions. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.
  If R is seventh, then the order of editing the articles would be Q, S, Y, H, G, J, and R. This order satisfies all of the given conditions. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of editing the articles would be Q, R, S, H, G, Y, and J. However, this violates the given condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, this cannot be the correct answer.

Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, because the mirror or the vase would have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, because the harmonica or the vase would have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. The harmonica and the lamp would be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but we don't know which one would be auctioned first.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The only option that could be true is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  The only possible option is that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so it cannot be auctioned on a later date than the table.
  The vase is auctioned on a date that is earlier than the date on which the table is auctioned, so it cannot be auctioned on a later date than the table.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("B")

  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then it cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, but this would mean that the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but this would mean that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which violates the given condition.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th, which satisfies all the given conditions.

Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?

Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the order of the lectures must be: Farley, Holden, Garcia, Jiang.
  A cannot be true because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  B can be true because there is no constraint that prevents Garcia from giving the sculptures lecture.
  C can be true because there is no constraint that prevents Garcia from giving the watercolors lecture.
  D cannot be true because Holden's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  E cannot be true because Jiang's lecture must be the last lecture, and the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which satisfies the constraint. Therefore, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which satisfies the constraint. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, which satisfies the constraint. Therefore, E can be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.

  Therefore, we can create a timeline to visualize the constraints.
  Farley's lecture must be first, and Holden's lecture must be second.
  Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be third and fourth, but we don't know which is which.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must be third and fourth, but we don't know which is which.
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some possibilities.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be second, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be later than Farley's lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the watercolors lecture must be third, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be later than the watercolors lecture.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then the sculptures lecture must be second, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then the watercolors lecture must be first, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be first.

Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Since Onyx is already assigned to 1922, Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, the only remaining year is 1924, which must be assigned to Ryan.
  The answer is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. However, Onyx is already assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project. 
  From the above reasoning, we can conclude that Louis, Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx must be assigned to the project, and Mollie and Yoshio cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis can be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, it is possible that Louis is not assigned to the project, but it is also possible that Louis is assigned to the project. However, Ryan must be assigned to the project, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  The only option that could be true is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.

Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J

  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first house to be shown.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so L must be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so K and M must be shown in the evening.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E.
  Choice C shows 0 and P being shown in the morning, which violates the rule that the first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.

Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be P, R, and T or P, R, and L.
  P is performed at some time before S, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be R, T, and P.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O, so the order of the first three compositions cannot be O, P, and T.
  Therefore, the only possible order of the first three compositions is L, H, and F.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the compositions performed must be T, R, F.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the compositions performed must be F, R, T.
  We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they do not have P performed in the first three compositions.
  We can eliminate choice B because it does not have O performed first or fifth.
  Therefore, the answer is A: F, H, P.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the other composition (not L or H) must be performed seventh.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed before F, then R must be performed seventh and L or H must be performed eighth.
  If T is performed after R, then L or H must be performed seventh and F must be performed eighth.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if T is performed before F, then the compositions performed after F and before R must be P and S.
  If T is performed after R, then the compositions performed after R and before F must be P and S.
  We can now check which answer choice satisfies all the given conditions.
  Answer choice A: F, H, P
    This order does not satisfy the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Answer choice B: H, P, L
    This order does not satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Answer choice C: O, P, R
    This order satisfies all the given conditions.
  Answer choice D: O, P, T
    This order does not satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Answer choice E: P, R, T
    This order does not satisfy the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, the answer is C: O, P, R. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if O is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  If O is performed fifth, then the order of the first three compositions must be F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  P is performed at some time before S, so P cannot be performed fourth.
  Therefore, the possible options for the first three compositions are O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  The only option that satisfies the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F is O, P, and R.
  The answer is C: O, P, R.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so the fifth composition must be either O or S.
  P is performed at some time before S, so P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so the remaining composition must be either R or T.
  T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, so if R is performed last, then T must be performed immediately before F.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, so if R is performed last, then F must be performed first.
  Therefore, the possible orders of the first three compositions are:
  1. F, H, L; and the possible orders of the last five compositions are: P, O, S, T, R; or P, S, O, T, R.
  2. L, H, F; and the possible orders of the last five compositions are: P, O, S, T, R; or P, S, O, T, R.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the compositions performed must be T, R, F.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the compositions performed must be F, R, T.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Answer choice A is not possible because P cannot be performed third if S is performed fourth.
  Answer choice B is not possible because H cannot be the eighth composition performed.
  Answer choice C is not possible because R cannot be performed third if S is performed fourth.
  Answer choice D is possible because O can be performed first if P is performed second and T is performed immediately before F.
  Answer choice E is not possible because R cannot be performed first or second if S is performed fourth.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be one of the following:
  1. O, F, R
  2. R, F, O
  3. O, R, F
  4. R, O, F
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, the possible orders of the first three compositions are:
  1. O, F, R, H/L, _, _, _, S
  2. R, F, O, H/L, _, _, _, S
  3. O, R, F, H/L, _, _, _, S
  4. R, O, F, H/L, _, _, _, S
  From the given choices, only D: O, P, T satisfies the possible orders of the first three compositions.
Action: Answer("D")

  P is performed at some time before S.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  From the given options, only option D satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first.
  If P is performed third, then O can be performed either first or fifth.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the eighth composition cannot be F, O, P, R, or T.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed sixth and F must be performed seventh.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed second and R must be performed first.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if F is performed second, then H or L must be performed third and O must be performed fourth.
  If F is performed seventh, then H or L must be performed sixth and O must be performed fifth.
  We know that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  Therefore, if O is performed first, then P must be performed second and S must be performed sixth or eighth.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed fourth and S must be performed sixth or eighth.
  If P is performed first, then the possible compositions for the first three performances are O, S, and either H or L.
  If P is performed second, then the possible compositions for the first three performances are either O, P, and S or H, P, and S.
  If P is performed third, then the possible compositions for the first three performances are either H or L, P, and O or O, P, and S.
  The only option that satisfies all the given conditions is option D: O, P, T.

Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then wall 4 must have at least one oil painting.
  Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4 because Isaacs's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall.
  Since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 4.
  Since no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, then Franz's oil must be displayed on a different wall from wall 4.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor is displayed on wall 4.
  Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  Therefore, Greene's oil is displayed in a lower position.
  The only statement that must be true is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  This means that no other painting by Isaacs can be displayed on wall 4.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4 because that would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 4.
  Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Greene's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is displayed in a lower position.
  The only answer choice that is necessarily true is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  Therefore, Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor are displayed on the same wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither Franz's watercolor nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  The only statement that must be true is B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall must be either wall 1 or wall 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position.
  We also know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 3 or wall 4.
  From the given conditions, we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, if Hidalgo's paintings are displayed on wall 3, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position.
  This means that Hidalgo's watercolor is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, and Hidalgo's oil is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then wall 4 must also have another oil painting displayed on it.
  Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4 because Isaacs's oil is already displayed there.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall.
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, then Hidalgo's two paintings must be displayed on the same wall as one of the paintings by Franz or Greene.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  The only option that is necessarily true is that Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.

  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, then wall 4 must have either Hidalgo's oil or watercolor displayed on it.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only oil paintings displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on a different wall from Isaacs's watercolor, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  Since each wall has exactly two paintings, then Greene's oil must be displayed in a lower position.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the same wall.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then wall 4 would have both a painting by Isaacs and a painting by Hidalgo displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then wall 1 would have only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then wall 4 would have both a painting by Isaacs and a painting by Hidalgo displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then wall 4 would have only oils displayed on it, which is not allowed.

Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday through Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first or second batch of any other kind of cookie.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.

  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

  If Fuentes has two photographs in the Sports section, then Hue must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  If Fuentes has three photographs in the Sports section, then Hue must have three photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have two or three photographs in the Sports section.
  If Fuentes has two photographs in the Sports section, then exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  If Fuentes has three photographs in the Sports section, then exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  Therefore, either A or B must be true.
Action: Answer("A")

  Therefore, the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  If Gagnon has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and none in the Sports section, then Gagnon must have one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes.
  The remaining photograph in the Sports section must be by either Gagnon or Hue.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.

Response 6:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Thus, Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Hue has one photograph in the Sports section.

  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Thus, Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections, and Hue's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Sports sections.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, Hue must have both photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and since Hue has two photographs in the Sports section, Fuentes must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.

Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for Wednesday: no cookies are made on Wednesday or one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday or Thursday.
  If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday or Thursday, and one batch of cookies made on either Monday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday or Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday. This leaves only Friday for the first batch of sugar cookies, which means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. This eliminates choices A, C, and E.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday. This leaves only Tuesday for the first batch of oatmeal cookies, which means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This eliminates choice B.
  Therefore, the answer is D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal cookies to be made: Monday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  This leaves only Tuesday for the third batch of peanut butter cookies, and only Monday for the third batch of sugar cookies.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: either no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday or all three batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on Monday, one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies.
  If all three batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  The answer is C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  In either case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: either no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, or one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on Tuesday and two batches of cookies made on Thursday.
  If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be one batch of cookies made on Tuesday and three batches of cookies made on Thursday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

Response 6:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: (1) no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, or (2) one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday to satisfy the condition that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday, and one batch of cookies made on Monday.
  From the given conditions, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday, and must be made on Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Tuesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Tuesday, and must be made on Thursday or Friday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  In either case, there must be exactly three batches of cookies made on Friday to satisfy the condition that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday.
  The third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  Therefore, the answer is D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: either no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, or one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday and Thursday, Tuesday and Friday, or Thursday and Friday.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, so there cannot be more than three batches of cookies made on any given day.
  Therefore, if one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be exactly three batches of cookies made on either Tuesday and Thursday, Tuesday and Friday, or Thursday and Friday.
  Let's consider each answer choice:
  A: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then there cannot be more than two batches of cookies made on any other day. This is not possible because we know that there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Monday, and there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  B: If exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, then there cannot be more than two batches of cookies made on any other day. This is not possible because we know that there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Monday, and there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  C: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then there can be at most one batch of cookies made on any other day. This is possible because we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, and there are no restrictions on the number of batches of different kinds of cookies that can be made on the same day.
  D: If at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, then there can be at most one batch of cookies made on any other day. This is not possible because we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Thursday.
  E: If fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday, then there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Tuesday. This is not possible because we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, and there are no restrictions on the number of batches of different kinds of cookies that can be made on the same day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Response 9:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday and Friday.
  If the third batch of cookies is made on Friday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  If the third batch of cookies is made on Tuesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the green team, and Olga would be on the red team, which contradicts the condition that Juana and Olga must be on different teams.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  Since Olga is a facilitator and Juana is on the green team, Olga must be the facilitator of the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the facilitator of the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well. Therefore, Olga must be assigned to the green team, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga cannot be a facilitator, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Lateefah cannot be a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator, which satisfies the given information.
  Juana and Mei are not both facilitators because Kelly is not a facilitator and there is only one facilitator on each team.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (facilitators: Lateefah and Olga) and red team (facilitator: Olga).
  If Juana is assigned to the green team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team, and Mei must be the facilitator.
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the green team, and Olga must be the facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the green team, and Olga would be on the red team, which contradicts the condition that Juana and Olga must be on different teams.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  Since Lateefah is already assigned to the green team, there are two possible configurations for the green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person (who is not Juana), or Lateefah, Juana, and Olga.
  However, Kelly cannot be a facilitator, so Olga must be the facilitator on the green team, and Juana must be on the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned as a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.

  There are two possible scenarios: 
    1. Green team has Lateefah and Olga, and Red team has Juana, Kelly, and Mei.
    2. Red team has Lateefah and Olga, and Green team has Juana, Kelly, and Mei.
  In both scenarios, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator or not.
  Olga is assigned as a facilitator to one of the teams, but we don't know which team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Mei's team assignment and facilitator status are unknown.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.

Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team assignments: Green team (facilitators: Lateefah and Olga) and Red team (facilitator: Juana).
  Mei can be assigned to either team.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Mei can be a facilitator or not.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and is not a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

Response 7:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well, and neither Juana nor Mei can be a facilitator. This contradicts the fact that Olga is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team with Lateefah and Olga.
  Mei and Kelly must be assigned to the red team, and one of them must be a facilitator.
  Thus, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, Lateefah is not assigned to the red team.
  Olga is a facilitator and Olga is assigned to a different team than Juana.
  Therefore, Juana is not a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  There are two teams, one with two members and one with three members.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team, which means the green team has three members.
  Therefore, the red team has two members.
  Mei is not mentioned in any of the conditions.
  Therefore, Mei can be assigned to either the green team or the red team.
  The only option left is that Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, A must be true.

Response 9:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well, and neither Juana nor Mei can be a facilitator. This would make Lateefah, Olga, and Kelly the members of the green team, and Lateefah would be the facilitator. This satisfies all of the conditions, so A is not necessarily true.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator or not. B is not necessarily true.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator. If Olga is assigned to the green team, then Lateefah, Olga, and one other person are on the green team, and Juana, Kelly, and Mei are on the red team. This satisfies all of the conditions, so C must be true.
  If Juana and Mei are both facilitators, then Olga cannot be a facilitator, which contradicts one of the conditions. Therefore, D is true.

Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that involves class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, which is the Lynch Building.
  Southco cannot have traded the Lynch Building with Trustcorp because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings left.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded the Lynch Building with RealProp or kept it.
  If Southco traded the Lynch Building with RealProp, then RealProp owns a class 2 building.
  If Southco kept the Lynch Building, then Southco owns a class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings.
  The only statement that must be true is that Trustcorp does not own the Meyer Building, which is a class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp owns the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp now owns only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so it cannot trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building.
  This means that RealProp now owns a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 2 buildings, so it cannot trade one of its buildings for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building.
  This means that Southco now owns a class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with RealProp or Trustcorp.
  The only option that is true is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp now owns only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 1 building is by trading it for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp now owns only class 2 and class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade with either RealProp or Southco.
  If Trustcorp traded with RealProp, then RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp traded with Southco, then Southco must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, either RealProp owns a class 1 building or Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("A or C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it will end up with a class 3 building.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building because it will end up with a class 1 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco can trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings because it will end up with no class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade a class 3 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it will end up with a class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that involves class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp owns only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco has not traded any of its buildings with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco still owns a class 2 building.
  The only option that is true is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it would still own a class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  The only class 1 building available for trade is the Garza Tower owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for one of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp still owns two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building.
  Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp because Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings to trade.
  Therefore, Southco must trade with RealProp.
  Southco can only trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade the Flores Tower for the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building.
  This means that Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, so it must have traded with Trustcorp at least once.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, but it is not necessarily true that it must own one.
  The ownership of the Garza Tower and the Zimmer House is not relevant to the question.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp now owns only class 3 buildings.
  The only way Southco can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings with Trustcorp.
  This means that Southco now owns only class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building with Trustcorp.
  This means that RealProp now owns a class 1 building, a class 2 building, and a class 3 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade with either RealProp or Southco.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building with RealProp, then RealProp must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building with Southco, then Southco must have traded a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands must be Wellspring, Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Vegemite performs in slot three.
  The answer is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:

  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Zircon performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Uneasy must perform in slot four, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot three.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Uneasy must perform in slot five, which satisfies the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

  If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot five.
  The order of the bands is Yardsign, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite, and Uneasy.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, in some order.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot three.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four or five.
  If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Yardsign must perform in slot two, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot five and Yardsign must perform in slot one.
  The only remaining slot is slot four, which must be filled by Zircon.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot four.
  The answer is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands must be Wellspring, Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Vegemite performs in slot three.

Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.
  E: A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.

Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option D supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.

  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A and D are both plausible options that could strengthen the argument.
  Option A suggests that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors, which implies that the implementation of the plan did not introduce a new policy but rather reinforced an existing one.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a direct result of the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  Option D is more relevant to the argument because it directly links the decrease in patient injuries to the implementation of the plan.

  Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. This suggests that the knowledge of being monitored led to the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors resulted in a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the implementation of the plan.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about the hospital's policy before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  Therefore, Option D most strengthens the argument.

  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D strengthens the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming more careful after they became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that the plan did not record all staff errors that could have caused patient injuries.
  Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true?
Choices:
  A: An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it.
  B: Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  C: When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly.
  D: For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  E: Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it.

Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?

  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.

  The evidence is that Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) performed better than Group B (composed of college students) in remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time.
  We need to find the option that is least helpful in establishing the conclusion.
  Option A is helpful because it tells us that the number of people in each group was the same.
  Option B is helpful because it tells us that the same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  Option C is helpful because it tells us that there were no persons more than forty years old among the college students.
  Option D is helpful because it tells us that both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  Option E is least helpful because it does not provide any information about the memory of the participants.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

Topic: Law
Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors.

Choices:
  A: widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society
  B: cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them

Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.

  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A suggests that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control, but this does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B suggests that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act, which contradicts the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument by stating that we can only be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but this does not support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.

  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn must support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. The argument is not that people should not be blamed for actions beyond their control, but rather that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough. The argument is not just that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C is the opposite of what the argument is saying. The argument is not that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed. The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.

  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should be related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action.
  Choice A is not related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action.
  Choice B is not related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action.
  Choice C is related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action, but it is not the assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  Choice D is related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action, and it is the assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  Choice E is not related to the justification of praising or blaming a person for an action.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. 
Action: Answer("D")

  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is a possible assumption, but it is too extreme and goes beyond the scope of the argument.
  Choice B is a possible assumption, but it does not directly support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice C is a restatement of the argument's conclusion, not an assumption.
  Choice D is a possible assumption that supports the idea that our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  Choice E is not an assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
Action: Answer("D")

Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that would enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn is the one that supports the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice C states this assumption.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument is against Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough to support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice C is the opposite of the argument.
  Choice D is also close, but it is not specific enough to support the conclusion of the argument.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices enable the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn.

Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.

Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion

Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.

  Option B is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  Option C is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  Option D is not relevant to the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.
Question: The argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true
  E: fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded

Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years

Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.

Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.
  E: The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind.

  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the studies were conducted 30 years ago and may not be relevant to the latest safety technology.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.

Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion

Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.

  B is not necessarily true because the passage states that a special whipping-cream attachment can help somewhat.
  C is not necessarily true because the passage states that a special whipping-cream attachment can only help somewhat, not always produce a fluffier result.
  D is not necessarily true because the passage does not provide information about the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively.
  E is not relevant to the information provided in the passage.

  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, A is true.
  B is not necessarily true because the passage states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  C is not true because the passage states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  D is not necessarily true because the passage does not provide information about the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in a blender with or without a special attachment.
  E is not relevant to the information provided in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.

Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only source of distraction in the workplace.
  The employee compares website filtering software to undecorated, windowless rooms.
  Both website filtering software and undecorated, windowless rooms are claimed to be sources of distraction.
  Therefore, the argument that is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument is that just because one thing can be distracting, it doesn't mean that all distractions should be eliminated.
  Choice D argues that just because engaging characters are important, it doesn't mean that publishers will accept a manuscript that only focuses on character development.
  This argument is similar to the employee's argument because it suggests that just because one element is important, it doesn't mean that it should be the only focus.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument implies that the company's reasoning is flawed because it only targets one type of distraction.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale, implying that focusing on one element of a story does not guarantee success.
  This is similar to the employee's argument because both arguments suggest that focusing on one aspect of a problem does not guarantee success.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace that are not being addressed.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters is not enough to guarantee a sale because publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  Both arguments point out that a single factor is not enough to achieve a desired outcome.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not banned. 
  The argument implies that the company's reasoning for the website filtering software is flawed.
  Choice D is similar in that it argues that a common belief is flawed.
  It argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale.
  Both arguments point out that a common belief is not necessarily true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions, such as offices with windows or decorations, are not blocked. 
  The argument implies that if the company is going to block one type of distraction, it should block all types of distractions.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a sale, implying that there are other elements that contribute to a successful novel or story.
  The argument implies that creating engaging characters is not enough to guarantee success.
  Therefore, the argument in choice D is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument is that just because one type of distraction is eliminated, it does not mean that employees will be more productive.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a successful novel or story.
  The argument is that just because one element is present, it does not mean that the work will be successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell.

Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.
Question: The journalist argues by
Choices:
  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion
  D: appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute
  E: clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply

Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer choice will undermine the argument's reasoning.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that the prevalence of H pylori as a commensal is much higher than that of M tuberculosis, which weakens the comparison between the two bacteria.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens immune response.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which does not provide any benefits to the people who harbor it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that more people benefit from H pylori than from M tuberculosis, which weakens the argument's comparison between the two bacteria.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning because it shows that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which means that even if only a small percentage of people get stomach ulcers from H pylori, it could still be considered a commensal in a larger population.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the presence of H pylori does not benefit people who harbor it or that the presence of M tuberculosis does benefit people who harbor it.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E supports the argument's reasoning.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E does not undermine the argument's reasoning.

Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not provide any benefits to people who harbor it.
  To undermine this argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the presence of H pylori does not provide any benefits to people who harbor it.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, but it does not address the issue of H pylori.
  Therefore, we need to keep looking for a statement that undermines the argument's reasoning.
  Choices A, B, D, and E are irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, none of the choices seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges one of these assumptions.
  Choice C challenges the assumption that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host.
  If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, then it is possible that H pylori could also be considered a commensal even if it causes stomach ulcers in some people.

Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which means that the polar bear may have used other senses to find its way home.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which means that the polar bear may have been familiar with the area.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, which means that the polar bear may have used its sense of smell to find its way home.
  Option A and Option E both cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, but Option E is a stronger contender as it directly relates to the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances.

Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer

Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  There is a discrepancy between the two statements.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments despite the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in captivity are not the primary cause of death in the wild.
  Therefore, option C most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same as those in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the life expectancy is the same despite the susceptibility to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not provide a clear explanation for the discrepancy.
  However, option C provides a reason why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in the wild is not significantly longer than those in captivity.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the cause of death is not related to the susceptibility to fatal diseases that leatherbacks in captivity face.
  Therefore, option C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  The resolution should explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E could explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks, as it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the fatal diseases in captivity do not affect the leatherbacks' life expectancy.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not explain why the fatal diseases in captivity do not affect the leatherbacks' life expectancy.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age. This implies that the leatherbacks in captivity may not be as old as they appear, which could explain why they are not affected by the fatal diseases. Therefore, E is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.

  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching the maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are likely to live long enough to reach their maximum life expectancy. This would explain why the likelihood of reaching the maximum life expectancy is the same in both captivity and the wild.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age, which could mean that the leatherbacks in captivity are not actually living as long as they appear to be. This could explain why they are not dying earlier than those in the wild.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:

  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild.
  However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they still have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This suggests that the fatal diseases that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to may not be as deadly as the predators in the wild, which could explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.

Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not mistake a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.

Topic: Law
Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 0.1 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that supports the prediction.
  The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers, but this does not support the prediction.
  It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, but this does not support the prediction.
  The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, but this does not support the prediction.
  Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, but this does not support the prediction.
  Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This statement does not directly support the prediction, but it does not contradict it either. It is possible that some people who give the game away to a friend may purchase another copy for themselves, which would increase sales. Therefore, this statement most helps to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports the prediction.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction.
  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the options help to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find a statement that supports the prediction.
  The fact that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward does not necessarily support the prediction.
  The fact that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend does not necessarily support the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the choices support the prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:

  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the options help to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that explains why sales will increase.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that the game takes a long time to complete, which may discourage people from purchasing it.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it doesn't explain why sales will increase.
  Option D suggests that people do not play the game extensively afterward, which may discourage people from purchasing it.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which may increase the game's popularity and lead to more sales.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the game will continue to sell well.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that the game takes a long time to complete, but it does not necessarily mean that it will continue to sell well.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not necessarily mean that this game will continue to sell well.
  Option D suggests that most people do not play the game extensively afterward, which may indicate that they are not interested in purchasing it. Therefore, it does not support the prediction.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. This option does not support the prediction either.
  Therefore, none of the options justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about the time taken to complete the game.
  Option A is also irrelevant because it talks about the availability of the game.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction because it only talks about the popularity of the publisher's games.
  Option D is not relevant because it talks about the post-completion behavior of players.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about people giving the game away to a friend.
  None of the options seem to support the prediction.
  However, the fact that rentals are exceeding expectations could be an indication that people are renting the game to try it out before buying it, which could lead to increased sales in the future.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people who rent the game are likely to buy it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that people may take a long time to complete the game, but it does not support the idea that renters are likely to buy the game.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not support the idea that renters are likely to buy the game.
  Option D suggests that people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, but it does not support the idea that renters are likely to buy the game.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which does not support the idea that renters are likely to buy the game.
  Therefore, none of the options help to justify the publisher's prediction.

Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark.
Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
  D: City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle.

Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have decreased. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason for the inflation rate to increase is the party's economic theories being wrong.
  Choice C has similar flawed reasoning because it assumes that the only reason for the stock price not to increase is the company failing to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")

  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened, but it increased instead. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice A talks about the architecture of the valley and how it remained the same throughout their stay. The argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This conclusion is not necessarily true.
  Choice B talks about the fear of workers striking if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically. The argument concludes that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This conclusion is not necessarily true.
  Choice C talks about the company's stock price not increasing in the last two years. The argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This conclusion is not necessarily true.
  Choice D talks about the city residents showing a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. The argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle. This conclusion is not necessarily true.
  Choice E talks about the new weather forecasting equipment of a television station. The argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This conclusion is similar to the argument above.
  Therefore, the answer is E: If the television station's new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.
  E: It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources.

  The columnist implies that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that a well-functioning democracy will pass a bill favored by most people within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.

  The columnist argues that a bill favored by most people and not violating anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because of the influence of those who would be adversely affected.
  The columnist implies that this is evidence that the country is not a well-functioning democracy.
  The principle that would most help justify the columnist's reasoning is that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law in a well-functioning democracy.
  Therefore, the answer is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.

Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?
Choices:
  A: rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail
  B: trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise
  C: criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
  D: taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim
  E: presupposing what it sets out to establish

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.

  The biologist argues that if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
  The answer choice that strengthens the biologist's argument must support the idea that the number of fingers we have is not inherently better or worse than other possible configurations.

  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that the number of fingers is not a significant factor in determining contentment.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it assumes that everyone is already content with our present configuration of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on any objective criteria.
  Choice E is irrelevant because it only talks about the existence of a fish with six phalanges in its fins, but it does not address the argument.

Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.

  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have made mistakes that went unnoticed.
  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, making it more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was already vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it does not suggest that the accountants are more likely to be the embezzler.
  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A strengthens the detective's argument by suggesting that the accountants were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries.
  Option B weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that someone outside the company could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that there were more accountants than actuaries, making it more likely that the embezzler was an accountant.
  Option D is irrelevant to the detective's argument.
  Option E weakens the detective's argument by suggesting that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. This option is irrelevant to the detective's argument and does not weaken it.

Topic: Law
Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.
  B: I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it.
  C: Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
  D: It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone.
  E: Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it.

Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 0.1 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.

Context: Richard: Because it fails to meet the fundamental requirement of art—that it represent—abstract art will eventually be seen as an aberration. Jung-Su: Although artists, like musicians, may reject literal representation, makers of abstract art choose to represent the purely formal features of objects, which are discovered only when everyday perspectives are rejected. Thus, whatever others might come to say, abstract art is part of the artistic mainstream.

Topic: Law
Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The geologist argues that the presence of biomarkers in petroleum supports the dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Answer choice C actually strengthens the argument because it suggests that it would take a long time for organisms to become petroleum, which supports the idea that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals.
  Answer choice D is also irrelevant because it does not address the argument.
  Answer choice E weakens the argument because it suggests that some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants, which means that the presence of biomarkers does not necessarily indicate the past or present existence of a living organism.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.

Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that if a person does not develop harmful symptoms after being exposed to a microorganism, then they have an immunity to that microorganism.
  The student assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  This is flawed because some people may not develop symptoms but are still susceptible to the microorganism.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar to option C, where the speaker assumes that medication always cures or alleviates symptoms.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because it assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms is equivalent to immunity.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is similar to the pattern of reasoning in which of the following choices?
  Choice A is about the relationship between morality and serving the interests of everyone, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice B is about the persuasive intent of advertisers and writers of fiction, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice C is about the assumption that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, which is not similar to the student's argument.
  Choice D is about the relationship between excessive taxation and business expansion, which is not similar to the student's argument.

  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The student argues that if people are not affected by a microorganism, then they have immunity to it.
  The student assumes that the lack of harmful symptoms means that the person has immunity.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  E: It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author.
Response 0:

  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The reason given is that the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possibilities that could undermine the journalist's reasoning.

  Option E is the most vulnerable criticism of the journalist's argument because it suggests that the failure of the critique to provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims need not be the result of personal biases of the author.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
  The reason given is that the physician who criticized the book is employed by the company that manufactures the drug and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possibilities that could undermine the journalist's conclusion.
  Choice A is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  Choice B is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument because it assumes that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  Choice C is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  Choice D is a possible criticism of the journalist's argument because it assumes that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
  Choice E is not relevant to the journalist's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects because the physician is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
  The argument assumes that the physician is biased and unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The journalist argues that the critique of the book does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.

  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks other possibilities or if it makes assumptions that are not necessarily true.
  Choice B criticizes the argument for assuming that anyone associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  This is a valid criticism because the argument assumes that the physician's critique is biased simply because he is employed by the company that manufactures the drug.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Topic: Law
Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above?
Choices:
  A: The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available.
  B: The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low.
  C: The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.
  D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.
  E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
Response 0:

  The antidote for chicken pox is effective at limiting the duration and severity of the disease.
  Researchers warn that the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  The question asks which of the following helps most to reconcile the discrepancy.
  Option A and B do not address the potential danger of the drug.
  Option D suggests that the drug can be dangerous if misused, but it does not address the potential danger of the drug when used as prescribed.
  Option E suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which could be the potential danger that researchers are warning about.
  Option C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, which could be another potential danger that researchers are warning about.
  Option C and E are both potential dangers that researchers could be warning about, but option E suggests a more severe consequence.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.

Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

Topic: Law
Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.
  B: Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress.
  C: In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
  D: Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth.
  E: Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought.
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  The conclusion is that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument is a statement that connects the evidence to the conclusion.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary because the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access vegetation.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.

Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be.
  B: The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it.

Topic: Law
Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A provides additional information that both groups of joggers had a lower rate of jogging injuries during the study than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  This suggests that both groups of joggers were less prone to jogging injuries than the general population.
  Therefore, the fact that both groups incurred roughly the same number of injuries may not be significant.
  Option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This means that both groups of joggers had fewer injuries than expected, which could be due to the study itself or other factors.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C states that most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  This means that stretching may not prevent injuries caused by external factors, but it does not necessarily mean that stretching does not help prevent injuries caused by other factors.
  Option D is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E states that stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from certain forms of exercise.
  This option does not weaken the argument that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries, as it only applies to certain forms of exercise.
  Therefore, the best option that weakens the medical researcher's argument is A.

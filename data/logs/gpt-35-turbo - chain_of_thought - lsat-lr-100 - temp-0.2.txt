Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  B: It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  E: It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas.

Topic: Law
Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely.
  B: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
  C: Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure.
  D: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely.
  E: If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer.

Topic: Law
Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above?
Choices:
  A: Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch.
  B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.
  C: People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  D: People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television.

Topic: Law
Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users.
  B: A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget.
  C: Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money.
  D: Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
  E: The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that the increase in subscription rates for scholarly journals must be due to the fact that publishing a scholarly journal is much more profitable now than it was several years ago.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the increase in subscription rates is not due to increased profitability of publishing scholarly journals.

Topic: Law
Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument?
Choices:
  A: Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient.
  B: The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question.
  C: The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not.
  D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  E: Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of a plan to record staff errors has reduced patient injuries.
  The argument suggests that the knowledge of being monitored made the staff more careful.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff becoming aware of the monitoring of their errors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has reduced the incidence of patient injuries.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough to record all errors.
  Choice D supports the argument because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness of the monitoring of their errors.
  Choice E is not relevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find a statement that shows that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it states that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A and D are both possible contenders for the correct answer.
  Option A shows that the hospitals already had a policy of investigating life-threatening staff errors, which means that the implementation of the plan did not introduce a new concept to the staff.
  Option D shows that the decrease in patient injuries did not begin until the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed, which means that the implementation of the plan was directly responsible for the decrease in patient injuries.
  Option D is a stronger statement because it directly links the decrease in patient injuries to the implementation of the plan.

  Option C weakens the argument because it states that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D shows that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that their errors were being recorded. This statement strengthens the argument by showing a causal relationship between the implementation of the plan and the decrease in patient injuries.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument since it talks about the consequences of staff errors.
  Option A and D are both plausible options that could strengthen the argument.
  However, option D is more relevant to the argument since it directly supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the decrease in patient injuries is directly related to the systematic recording of staff errors.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive enough.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A could be a potential contender, but it does not directly relate to the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was a result of the staff becoming aware that their errors were being monitored, which directly supports the argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:

  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the cause of the decrease in patient injuries.
  Option A may be tempting, but it does not strengthen the argument because it talks about a policy that was already in place before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D supports the argument by suggesting that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness that their errors were being monitored. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that the systematic recording of staff errors reduced the incidence of patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the systematic recording of staff errors was the reason for the decrease in patient injuries.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B is not relevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument by stating that not all staff errors were recorded.
  Option D strengthens the argument by stating that the decrease in the incidence of injuries began only after the staff became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends?
Choices:
  A: More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development.
  B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
  C: In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated.
  D: Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife.
  E: The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The Figorian Wildlife Commission argues that to protect wildlife, future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats.

  Choice B states this assumption.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument of the Figorian Wildlife Commission is that future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats to protect wildlife.
  The assumption on which this argument depends must be a statement that, if false, would make the conclusion invalid.
  If the species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will not survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands, then the conclusion that development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them would be invalid.
  Therefore, the assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends is B: The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  B: Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them.
  C: The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction.
  D: The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense.
  E: The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense.

Topic: Law
Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  B: It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  D: It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  E: It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

Topic: Law
Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors?
Choices:
  A: The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects.
  B: Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter.
  C: In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion.
  D: Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
  E: Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high.

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages.
Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: There was the same number of people in each group.
  B: The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
  C: Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old.
  D: Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls.
  E: The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls.

Topic: Law
Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species?
Choices:
  A: The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate.
  B: Older trees tend to reproduce the least.
  C: The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests.
  D: The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction.
  E: The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.

Topic: Law
Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn?
Choices:
  A: People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  B: Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act.
  C: We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  D: The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  E: If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that we can only praise or blame someone for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument also rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion to be properly drawn must support the argument and reject Tolstoy's claim.

  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is restating the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.

  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. The argument does not go that far.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not strong enough to support the conclusion of the argument. It says that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. But the argument is not about whether the person is genuinely responsible. It is about whether we can praise or blame the person for the action.
  Choice C is the best answer. It supports the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we regard that action as freely performed.
  Choice D is incorrect. It says that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but the argument is not about the degree of responsibility. It is about whether we can praise or blame the person for the action.
  Choice E is incorrect. It says that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. But the argument is not about what we will regard as freely performed. It is about whether we can praise or blame the person for the action.

It says that whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. The argument is not about whether others possess information, but about whether we know a lot about the events that led to the action.
  Choice C is incorrect. It is the argument itself.
  Choice D is also incorrect. It says that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. The argument is not about the inclination to blame or praise, but about whether we can justifiably blame or praise.
  Choice E is incorrect. It says that if we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. The argument is not about what we will regard as freely performed, but about what we can justifiably praise or blame.

Topic: Law
Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion?
Choices:
  A: Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas.
  B: All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions.
  C: A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
  D: Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries.
  E: Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization.

Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct.
Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it
Choices:
  A: infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect
  B: relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased
  C: depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion

Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument?
Choices:
  A: A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
  B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.
  C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.
  D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.
  E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain.
  The logically strongest counter to the physician's argument would be a statement that undermines the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving some back pain.

  Option D suggests that the sale on Maxlast hammers was advertised, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which could explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option A is irrelevant to the situation.
  Option B suggests that customers are not motivated by low prices, which contradicts the fact that the Maxlast hammers were on sale.
  Option C suggests that customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week were motivated by the sale, but it does not explain why Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers.

  Option E suggests that a single item on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store, which may explain why customers who came to the store did not buy Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Option C is not a good explanation because it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option B is not a good explanation because it suggests that quality and service are more important to customers than low prices, but it does not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option A and Option E are not good explanations because they do not explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option D is the best explanation because it suggests that the flyers publicizing the sale prices on Maxlast hammers may have motivated customers to come to the store to buy hammers, but some customers may have decided to buy the Styron hammers instead of the Maxlast hammers.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers despite the Maxlast hammers being on sale.
  Choice A is not relevant to the surprising result.

  Therefore, they might have bought Styron hammers this week instead of Maxlast hammers.
  Option C best explains the surprising result.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The surprising result is that the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers even though the Maxlast hammers were on sale.

Topic: Law
Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument?
Choices:
  A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.
  B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
  C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.
  D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
  E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez because Lopez eventually won the election.
  Option A is irrelevant because it talks about people who voted in the election, not the survey respondents.
  Option B undermines the argument because it suggests that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been representative of the live audience watching the debate.
  Option C is irrelevant because it talks about the voting behavior of people who watched the debate, not the survey respondents.
  Option D is irrelevant because it talks about the survey respondents' voting intentions prior to the debate, not their opinions after the debate.
  Option E is irrelevant because it talks about the margin of victory, not the survey respondents' bias.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate.

Choices:
  A: takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
  B: fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences
  C: favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing
  D: concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true

Topic: Law
Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used.
Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions?
Choices:
  A: The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before.
  B: The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period.
  C: The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used.
  D: The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
  E: Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used.

Topic: Law
Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument
Choices:
  A: mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
  B: does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them
  C: fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers
  D: overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years
  E: provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that the net income from sales of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer must be only half of what it was 5 years ago because of the decline in the market share of the product.
  However, the argument does not consider other factors that could affect the net income of the company.

Topic: Law
Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument?
Choices:
  A: A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas.
  B: Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas.
  C: Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon.
  D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
  E: The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana.
Response 0:

  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken this argument, we need to find an option that contradicts the argument.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not weaken the argument, but rather supports the idea that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D contradicts the argument, as it suggests that the iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which is not in the Americas.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

Topic: Law
Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument?
Choices:
  A: The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances.
  B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
  C: The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago.
  D: The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.

  The flaw in the editorialist's argument is that the studies conducted 30 years ago may not be applicable to the latest safety technology.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.

  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that safety would not decrease because of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist's conclusion is based on studies conducted 30 years ago, which may not be relevant today.
  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.

Topic: Law
Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it
Choices:
  A: overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes
  B: fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
  C: takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists
  D: concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe
  E: takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  B: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
  C: When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment.
  D: The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender.
  E: The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that whipping cream in a blender results in a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream.
  The passage also states that using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, but it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Therefore, statement A is true.
  Statement B is also true because the passage states that the special attachment cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake.
  Statement C is false because the passage states that the special attachment can only help somewhat, not always produce a fluffier result.
  Statement D is true because the passage states that the special attachment can help somewhat, which means it can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively.
  Statement E is not mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or D.

Topic: Law
Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  B: Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  The argument presents a situation where a healthier diet is not recommended because it would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  The reasoning is that if everyone adopted the diet, it would be impossible to sustain the marine species.
  The argument is similar to the reasoning in option C, where a spending pattern is not recommended because if everyone adopted it, it would lead to a severe recession.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The argument presents a dilemma where a healthier diet based on fish protein would lead to the extinction of marine species.
Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Option A presents a similar argument where taking vitamin E supplements every day reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
Option B presents an argument where governments can tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. However, if these taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, the argument concludes that such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.

Option E presents an argument where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But it also reduces the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, the argument concludes that it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Option A, B, C, and E present arguments that are similar in structure to the argument in the question stem. However, option A is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. Option B is not the best answer because it is not about a trade-off. Option C is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. Option E is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. 
Therefore, the best answer is D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.

Topic: Law
Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room.
Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument?
Choices:
  A: Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences.
  B: Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.
  C: Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year.
  D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements.
  E: In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument is that just because something can be distracting, it does not mean it should be banned.
  Choice D argues that just because engaging characters are necessary for a novel, it does not guarantee a sale.
  The reasoning is similar to the employee's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software is not necessary because other distractions exist in the workplace.
  The argument must be similar in reasoning.
  Choice D argues that creating engaging characters does not guarantee a successful novel or story.
  This is similar to the employee's argument because just as engaging characters do not guarantee a successful novel or story, website filtering software does not guarantee that employees will not be distracted.
  Therefore, the answer is D: In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell.

Response 2:
Thought: 
  The employee argues that website filtering software blocks access to non-work-related websites, but offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too. 
  The argument implies that the company's reasoning is flawed because it fails to take into account other factors that can be equally or more distracting.
  Option D is similar in that it suggests that a particular criterion for success is flawed because it fails to take into account other factors that can be equally or more important.

Response 7:
Thought:
The employee argues that website filtering software is not the only thing that can be distracting, and therefore it is not a good reason to block access to non-work-related websites.

Topic: Law
Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study?
Choices:
  A: Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
  B: Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes.
  C: Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities.
  D: The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes.
  E: When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily.

Topic: Law
Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem.
  B: Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales.

Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief.

  A: pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
  B: defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it
  C: defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion

Topic: Law
Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.
  B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.
  C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
  D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.
  E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis is not a commensal despite the fact that only a small percentage of people who harbor it get sick.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the two bacteria are not comparable in terms of their relationship with the human body.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of the diseases caused by the two bacteria, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning by stating that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which implies that it cannot be considered a commensal.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by stating that more people harbor H pylori than M tuberculosis, which suggests that the benefits of H pylori's presence in the body may outweigh its negative effects.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis that would justify considering one a commensal but not the other.
  Choice C suggests that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which could be a reason to consider it different from H pylori.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The correct answer will undermine the argument's reasoning by showing that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E undermines the argument's reasoning by showing that more people benefit from H pylori than from M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis is not considered a commensal despite causing illness in only 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument assumes that the only factor that determines whether a bacterium is a commensal is the percentage of people who get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to show that there are other factors that determine whether a bacterium is a commensal.
  Choice C, which states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, suggests that the presence of a bacterium must provide some benefit to the host in order to be considered a commensal.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people, while M tuberculosis cannot be considered a commensal because it does not benefit people who harbor it.
  To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the presence of H pylori does not always cause harm, or that the presence of M tuberculosis does sometimes benefit people who harbor it.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it compares the duration of two diseases, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning and does not undermine it.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E provides evidence that undermines the argument's reasoning because it suggests that more people benefit from the presence of H pylori than from the presence of M tuberculosis.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which is not considered a commensal.
  The argument assumes that the only reason to consider a bacterium a commensal is if it provides a benefit to the host.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to show that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed or that the assumption about commensals is incorrect.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C challenges the assumption that a commensal must provide a benefit to the host.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that H pylori cannot be considered a commensal because it causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of the people who harbor it.
  The argument then compares this to M tuberculosis, which only causes sickness in about 10% of the people who harbor it, but is not considered a commensal.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori is not a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, claiming that it is not a commensal despite the fact that only 10% of people who harbor it get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that challenges the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C supports the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E challenges the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis by suggesting that there are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis, which could explain why H pylori is considered a commensal while M tuberculosis is not.
  Therefore, the answer is E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that H pylori should not be considered a commensal despite its alleged benefits because it causes stomach ulcers in some people.
  The argument uses M tuberculosis as a counterexample, but only a small percentage of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows the differences between H pylori and M tuberculosis are significant enough to make the comparison invalid.
  A, B, C, and D do not address the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis.
  E does not undermine the argument's reasoning, as it does not show that the differences between H pylori and M tuberculosis are significant enough to make the comparison invalid.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument is that H pylori should not be considered a commensal even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response and only causes stomach ulcers in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which also only causes sickness in less than 10% of people who harbor it.
  The argument concludes that H pylori should not be considered a commensal, but M tuberculosis is not a commensal either.
  To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to find a statement that shows that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is not valid.
  Choice C states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, which is a significant difference from H pylori, which allegedly strengthens the immune response.
  Therefore, choice C most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning.

Topic: Law
Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim?
Choices:
  A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
  B: The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
  C: The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice.
  D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances.
  E: Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory.

Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which indicates that the polar bear may not have used navigational skills to return home.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which supports the naturalists' claim.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  They cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This option does not cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This option does not cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This option does not cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This option casts doubt on the validity of the evidence because it suggests that the polar bear's ability to navigate over considerable distances may not be unique to polar bears.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This option does not cast much doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

Thought:
  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  To cast doubt on the validity of the evidence, we need to find an option that weakens the evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This means that the polar bear may not have used its navigational skills to return home.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This means that the polar bear may have returned home using its annual migration route rather than its navigational skills.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This option does not weaken the evidence.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. This option does not weaken the evidence.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. This option does not weaken the evidence.
  Therefore, the best option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence is A: The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory.

Topic: Law
Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it.
Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that
Choices:
  A: the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably
  B: the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets
  C: fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets
  D: the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees
  E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer.
  The colon cancer rate is higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.
  In Scandinavia, the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption of cereals, which are high in fiber.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there may be other factors that contribute to colon cancer besides fiber consumption.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument because it does not address the relationship between fiber consumption and colon cancer.
  Choice E is the most likely answer because it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for preventing colon cancer, rather than fiber alone.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that there is a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The argument also states that the colon cancer rate is much higher in Western countries where people eat less fiber-rich foods.

  Answer choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice B supports the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice C is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice D is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Answer choice E points out that foods containing fiber also contain other substances that prevent colon cancer, which weakens the argument's claim that fiber alone is responsible for preventing colon cancer.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it overlooks the possibility that there might be other factors that contribute to the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument because the argument is only concerned with the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument because the argument assumes that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument because the argument does not differentiate between the types of fiber in fruits and vegetables and cereals.
  Choice E is a possible criticism because the argument assumes that fiber is the only substance that prevents colon cancer, but there might be other substances in foods containing fiber that also prevent colon cancer.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fiber also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument supports this claim by citing studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer incidence.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may affect colon cancer incidence, such as genetics, lifestyle, and other dietary factors.
  The question asks for a criticism that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice B is not necessarily a criticism of the argument's reasoning, as it does not contradict the claim that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D is a possible criticism, as it suggests that not all types of fiber are equally effective in preventing colon cancer.
  Choice E is also a possible criticism, as it suggests that other substances in fiber-containing foods may be responsible for the observed correlation between high-fiber diets and colon cancer prevention.
  Both choices D and E are possible criticisms, but choice E is a more general criticism that applies to all fiber-containing foods, while choice D is more specific to different types of fiber.

Topic: Law
Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy?
Choices:
  A: Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles.
  B: The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals.
  C: Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
  D: Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks despite the susceptibility of captive leatherbacks to fatal diseases.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the fatal diseases that captive leatherbacks are susceptible to may not be as significant a factor in determining the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet they still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both groups.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C does not explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  Choice D is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E could explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy as those in the wild, as it suggests that the size of a leatherback is not a reliable indicator of its age.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why leatherbacks in captivity are not affected by the fatal diseases.
  Choice A, B, C, D, and E do not provide a clear explanation for the discrepancy.
  However, choice A provides information that is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B provides information that is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C provides information that is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D provides information that is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E provides information that is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the choices help to resolve the apparent discrepancy.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  The correct answer should explain why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments despite the susceptibility of leatherbacks to fatal diseases in captivity.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both groups.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both groups.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are likely to live long enough to reach their maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity but still have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the fatal diseases do not affect the leatherbacks' life expectancy in captivity.
  Choice A, B, C, D, and E do not provide a clear explanation of why the leatherbacks' life expectancy is not affected by fatal diseases in captivity.
  However, choice D implies that the reason why leatherbacks are not affected by fatal diseases in captivity is that zoologists do not have enough knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  Therefore, choice D most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would not encounter in the wild.
  The discrepancy is that one would expect leatherbacks in the wild to live longer than those in captivity.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both cases.
  Choice C provides an explanation that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, which means that the ones that survive are likely to reach their maximum life expectancy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild.
  Despite this, the likelihood of a leatherback reaching its maximum life expectancy is the same in captivity and in the wild.
  We need to find an option that resolves this discrepancy.
  Option C provides a reason why the life expectancy of leatherbacks in the wild is not higher than those in captivity.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity and in the wild have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy.
  The argument also states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer that explains why leatherbacks in captivity are not affected by fatal diseases as much as we would expect.
  Option A, B, C, and E do not provide any explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
  Option D provides an explanation that zoologists do not have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks.
  This explanation suggests that the reason why leatherbacks in captivity are not affected by fatal diseases as much as we would expect is that zoologists have created an environment that is conducive to their well-being.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument states that leatherbacks are susceptible to fatal diseases in captivity, but their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same as those living in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the leatherbacks in captivity are not dying from the diseases that they are susceptible to.
  Option A, B, C, D, and E do not provide any explanation for the apparent discrepancy.
  Therefore, none of the options help to resolve the apparent discrepancy.

Topic: Law
Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting "Hero," its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, "Hero" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so.
Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning?
Choices:
  A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition
  B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result
  C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true
  D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
  E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the opinion of consumers is a reliable indicator of market dominance.
  However, the opinion of consumers may not necessarily reflect the actual market share of "Hero."
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the belief of the consumers is true and that it will remain true in the future.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The answer is D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the belief of the consumers is a sufficient condition to guarantee that Harrold Foods dominates the market.
  However, the belief of the consumers is not enough to guarantee that Harrold Foods dominates the market.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the survey results are accurate and that the current market share of Harrold Foods will remain the same.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not mistake a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  However, the argument commits the error of describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
  Therefore, the answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that "Hero" dominates the market because it has more than 50% of the sales in the market.
  The argument also states that 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the belief of the consumers is equivalent to the actual market share.
  However, the belief of the consumers may not reflect the actual market share.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The answer is D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument states that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers believe that "Hero" already dominates the market.
  The argument assumes that the consumers' belief is accurate and that the current market share of "Hero" will remain the same.
  However, the argument does not provide any evidence to support these assumptions.
  Therefore, the argument commits the error of assuming that the current market share will remain the same without providing any evidence to support this assumption.
  The answer is E: describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well.
Action: Answer("E")

  The argument commits the error of mistaking a necessary condition for a sufficient condition.
  The argument assumes that having more than 50% of the sales in a market is sufficient to guarantee dominance in that market, but this is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because 72% of all consumers think that "Hero" already dominates the market.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction?
Choices:
  A: The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers.
  B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
  C: The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market.
  D: Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward.
  E: Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option B is irrelevant because it talks about the time taken to complete the game.
  Option A is also irrelevant because it talks about the availability of the game.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction because it only talks about the popularity of the publisher's games.
  Option D is irrelevant because it talks about the post-completion behavior of the players.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it talks about the behavior of some players after completing the game.
  None of the options seem to support the prediction.
  However, the best option among the given choices is C because it at least indicates that the publisher has a good reputation in the market, which could lead to higher sales.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people who rent the game will eventually buy it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B is also irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the rental or purchase of the game.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option D is not helpful because it suggests that people who complete the game do not play it again, but it does not provide any information about the rental or purchase of the game.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it does not provide any information about the rental or purchase of the game.
  None of the options seem to justify the publisher's prediction, but option A is the most likely to be helpful because it suggests that the publisher has more than one channel to sell the game, which could increase the chances of people buying it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people who rent the game will eventually buy it.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that people may take a long time to complete the game, but it does not support the idea that renters will buy the game.
  Option C suggests that the publisher's games are popular, but it does not support the idea that renters will buy the game.
  Option D suggests that people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, but it does not support the idea that renters will buy the game.
  Option E suggests that some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, which does not support the idea that renters will buy the game.
  Therefore, none of the options help to justify the publisher's prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals.
  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the justification for the publisher's prediction should be related to the sales of the game.
  Option B is irrelevant to the sales of the game.
  Option A, C, D, and E are not directly related to the sales of the game.
  However, option A and C can be considered as indirect factors that can affect the sales of the game.
  Option D and E are not related to the sales of the game.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the game will continue to sell well.
  Option A is not relevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that the game takes a long time to complete, which could mean that people will rent it multiple times before buying it, supporting the prediction.
  Option C suggests that the publisher is well-known and has a good reputation, but it doesn't directly relate to the prediction.
  Option D suggests that people won't play the game much after completing it, which doesn't support the prediction.
  Option E suggests that some people buy the game and then give it away, which doesn't support the prediction.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that supports the idea that people who rented the game will eventually purchase it.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option A is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction.
  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find a statement that supports the idea that sales will increase.
  The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers, but this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, but this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market, but this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward, but this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend, but this does not necessarily mean that sales will increase.
  However, the fact that the publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price, suggests that renters are likely to purchase the game after renting it, which would increase sales.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Most people who rent the game and complete it go on to purchase it. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  To justify this prediction, we need to find an option that explains why sales will increase.
  Option A is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option B suggests that players will take a long time to complete the game, which may not necessarily lead to an increase in sales.
  Option C is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option D suggests that players will not play the game extensively afterward, which may not necessarily lead to an increase in sales.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  None of the options seem to justify the publisher's prediction.
  However, option B seems to be the most relevant to the context.
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, then they may be more likely to purchase the game instead of renting it, which could lead to an increase in sales.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations.
  We need to find an option that supports this prediction.
  Option B is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option A is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option C is not enough to support the prediction.
  Option D is irrelevant to the prediction.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the prediction.
  Therefore, none of the options support the prediction.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay.
  B: Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.

Thought: 
  The argument above states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But since the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  This is an example of a flawed reasoning called "affirming the consequent".
  Affirming the consequent is a formal fallacy, where a conditional statement is taken to be true because its consequent is true. 
  The argument in choice C follows the same flawed reasoning as the argument above.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, which may not be true.
  Similarly, one of the choices may assume something that may not be true.
  Choice A assumes that the valley people were not invaded because the architecture remained the same, which may not be true.
  Choice B assumes that the workers will not strike because they promised not to, which may not be true.
  Choice C assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase, which may not be true.
  Choice D assumes that the rebels won the battle because the residents showed support, which may not be true.
  Choice E assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased, which may not be true.
  The argument above and choice C assume that if a certain condition were met, a certain outcome would have occurred. However, because the outcome did not occur, the condition must not have been met. Therefore, the flawed reasoning in choice C most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened, but it actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice C has a similar flawed reasoning where it states that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Therefore, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But since the inflation rate increased, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, which is not necessarily true.
  Similarly, one of the choices may also assume something that is not necessarily true.
  Choice A assumes that the valley people were not invaded because the architecture remained the same throughout their stay, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B assumes that the workers will not strike because they promised not to, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice C assumes that the company failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice D assumes that the rebels won the battle because the residents showed support for them, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice E assumes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old because the station's ratings decreased, which is not necessarily true.
  The argument above assumes something to be true that is not necessarily true, which is similar to the flawed reasoning in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But the inflation rate actually increased. Therefore, the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice A talks about the architecture in the valley remaining the same throughout their stay. The argument concludes that the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence.
  Choice B talks about workers in key industries who have promised not to strike. The argument concludes that these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that a lack of action is evidence of belief.
  Choice C talks about the company's stock price not increasing in the last two years. The argument concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that correlation implies causation.
  Choice D talks about city residents showing a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days. The argument concludes that the rebels must have won the battle. This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that a cause must have a single effect.
  Choice E talks about the television station's ratings actually decreasing. The argument concludes that the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This is a flawed reasoning of assuming that a lack of evidence is evidence of absence.
  
  Therefore, the argument in the question most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The argument claims that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation would have led to a decrease in the inflation rate. It does not consider other factors that could have contributed to the increase in the inflation rate.
  Choice C is similar in that it assumes that the company's failure to sell its subsidiaries is the only reason why the stock price did not increase. It does not consider other factors that could have affected the stock price.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. However, the inflation rate increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  Choice A talks about how the architecture in the valley remained the same throughout the stay of the valley people, so they must not have been invaded. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for changes in architecture is invasion or climatic change.
  Choice B talks about how workers have promised not to strike, so they must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. This argument is flawed because it assumes that workers will always keep their promises.
  Choice C talks about how the stock price would have doubled if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent. However, the stock price did not increase, so the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the stock price to increase is the sale of subsidiaries.
  Choice D talks about how residents have shown a great deal of support for the rebels for the last three days, so the rebels must have won the battle. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for residents to show support is the victory of the rebels.
  Choice E talks about how the accuracy of the station's forecasts would have risen, along with its ratings, if the new weather forecasting equipment had been worth the investment. However, the station's ratings actually decreased, so the new equipment is no improvement on the old. This argument is flawed because it assumes that the only reason for the decrease in ratings is the lack of improvement in the new equipment.
  Choice C is the argument that most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and implemented, the inflation rate would have lessened. But the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The reasoning is flawed because it assumes that the party's economic theories were sound and that their implementation would have led to a decrease in the inflation rate.
  The argument ignores other factors that could have contributed to the increase in inflation rate.
  Option C is similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above.
  It assumes that if the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.

Topic: Law
Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position?
Choices:
  A: National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered.
  B: The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations.
  C: Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
  D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment.

Topic: Law
Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one.
Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning?
Choices:
  A: In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
  B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
  C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.
  D: Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights.
  E: A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.

  Therefore, the answer is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not be passed into law because those who oppose it are very influential.
Option A is not valid because the columnist argues that even if a bill benefits most people, it will not be passed into law.
Option B is not valid because the columnist argues that a bill that is opposed by influential people will not pass into law.
Option D is not valid because the columnist argues that a bill that is consistent with individuals' basic human rights will not necessarily pass into law.
Option E is not valid because the columnist argues that a bill that is favored by most people and does not violate anyone's basic human rights will not necessarily pass into law.
Option C is valid because it states that a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential, which supports the columnist's argument.
Therefore, the answer is C: In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential.

Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services.
Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument?

Topic: Law
Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers.
  B: Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans could be content with six fingers per hand if we had evolved from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans can be content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not provide evidence that humans can be content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans cannot be content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide evidence that humans can be content with different configurations of fingers.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective facts but on our prejudices.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument because it does not provide evidence that humans can be content with different configurations of fingers.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to show that the number of fingers does not affect the usefulness of the hand.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not supported by the argument.
  Choice C is too strong and not supported by the argument.
  Choice D is close, but it is too extreme and not supported by the argument.
  Choice E is the best answer because it supports the idea that a fish with six phalanges in its fins could have existed and therefore humans could have had six fingers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that humans are content with other things of equal usefulness.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not true, and it does not support the argument.
  Choice C is too strong, and it is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D supports the argument, but it is not as strong as choice E.
  Choice E provides evidence that supports the biologist's argument. If at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, then it is more likely that humans could have descended from such a fish and evolved to have six fingers. Therefore, choice E is the best answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that humans would be just as content with six fingers if we had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that the number of fingers is not a significant factor in determining contentment.
  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it assumes that everyone is already content with our present configuration of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are not content with two things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C is a restatement of the biologist's argument and does not provide any additional support.
  Choice D strengthens the argument by suggesting that our perception of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not based on objective criteria.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument because it only provides information about fish and not about humans.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.

  Choice A does not strengthen the argument because it does not address the usefulness of our configuration of fingers.
  Choice B weakens the argument because it suggests that humans are not content with things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C strengthens the argument by stating that humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D supports the biologist's argument, but it does not strengthen it.
  Choice E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The argument is based on the premise that our configuration of fingers is not inherently better than other configurations.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to provide evidence that supports the premise.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not true, as people often use things of unequal usefulness.
  Choice C is too strong and not necessarily true.
  Choice D is consistent with the biologist's argument, but it does not provide evidence to support the premise.
  Choice E provides evidence that supports the premise that other configurations of fingers are possible.
  Therefore, the answer is E: At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins.

  Choice C strengthens the argument by suggesting that humans are always content with things of equal usefulness.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice E is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The biologist argues that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not due to its inherent superiority but rather due to our prejudices.
  To strengthen this argument, we need to show that usefulness is not the only factor that determines our contentment with a particular configuration of fingers.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B contradicts the biologist's argument.
  Choice C supports the biologist's argument but does not strengthen it.
  Choice D supports the biologist's argument but does not strengthen it.
  Choice E suggests that the biologist's hypothetical scenario is plausible, which strengthens the argument.

  The biologist's argument is that our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations.
  The argument is based on the premise that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not determined by the number of phalanges in the fins of the fish we descended from.
  Therefore, the answer choice that most strengthens the biologist's argument should support the premise that the usefulness of our configuration of fingers is not determined by the number of phalanges in the fins of the fish we descended from.
  Answer choice E supports this premise by providing evidence that at least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins, which suggests that the number of phalanges in the fins of the fish we descended from is not the sole determinant of the usefulness of our configuration of fingers.

Topic: Law
Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries.
Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants.
  B: There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records.
  C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.
  D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
  E: Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the detective's argument because if the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized, then it is less likely that one of them could have embezzled money without being caught.
  Option B weakens the detective's argument because if there were breaches in computer security, then it is possible that someone outside the company could have accessed the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the detective's argument because if there are more accountants than actuaries, then it is possible that one of the accountants could have embezzled the money.
  Option D does not weaken the detective's argument because the report was released before the crime took place and does not provide any information about who committed the crime.
  Option E weakens the detective's argument because if it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records, then it is less likely that one of them could have embezzled money.
  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. This option does not weaken the detective's argument.

  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely to be one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  To weaken the detective's argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that the embezzler could still be an accountant.
  A: If the activities of the actuaries were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants, it would make it less likely that one of the actuaries was the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.
  B: If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to internal financial records, it would mean that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or actuary. This weakens the detective's argument.
  C: The fact that there are more accountants than actuaries on staff does not weaken the detective's argument.
  D: The fact that an independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement does not weaken the detective's argument.
  E: If certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, it would make it less likely that one of the actuaries was the embezzler. This weakens the detective's argument.

  Therefore, the answer is D: An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have made mistakes that went unnoticed.
  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the company could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, so it is more likely that the embezzler is an accountant.
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may have had less access to the internal financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The detective's argument is that the embezzler is one of the actuaries because an accountant would not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the argument because it suggests that the accountants could have also embezzled money.
  Option B weakens the argument because it suggests that someone outside the corporation could have had access to the internal financial records.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, so the probability of an accountant being the embezzler is higher.
  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the corporation was already vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries had less access to internal financial records than the accountants, which supports the detective's argument.
  Therefore, the answer is C: XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff.

  We need to find the option that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that the accountants' activities were more closely scrutinized than the actuaries', which could have led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  Option B weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that persons outside XYZ Corporation could have had access to internal financial records, which means that the embezzler could have been someone other than an accountant or an actuary.
  Option C weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that there are more accountants than actuaries, which means that the embezzler could have been an accountant.
  Option D does not weaken the detective's argument because it is about a report released before the crime took place and does not provide any information about the embezzler.
  Option E weakens the detective's argument because it suggests that it was more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants, which means that the embezzler could have been an accountant.

Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-lr-100 | Temperature: 0.2 | Problem 71 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  D: When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  E: Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.

Topic: Law
Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument?
Choices:
  A: The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given.
  B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
  C: Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues.
  D: Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error.
  E: Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument states that people with specialized knowledge are excluded from juries, making the trial unfair.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that the exclusion of people with specialized knowledge does not necessarily make the trial unfair.
  Option A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Option B suggests that jurors with specialized knowledge may be biased, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option C talks about appointing an arbitrator, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D suggests that expert witnesses may not be certain, which is not relevant to the argument.
  Option E is also not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, none of the options weakens the argument.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  The argument claims that juries are not fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that juries can still be fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it discusses arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it discusses how experts give testimony, not the fairness of juries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Therefore, none of the choices weaken the argument.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument since it discusses arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D is also irrelevant since it discusses the behavior of expert witnesses, not jurors.
  Choice E is also irrelevant since it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Therefore, none of the choices weaken the argument.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument claims that juries are not fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because jurors without specialized knowledge are systematically excluded.
  To weaken the argument, we need to show that juries are still fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  Choice A supports the argument by stating that jurors without specialized knowledge may not be able to comprehend the testimony.
  Choice B also supports the argument by stating that jurors with specialized knowledge may be prejudiced.
  Choice C is irrelevant to the argument because it discusses impartial arbitrators, not juries.
  Choice D is also irrelevant because it discusses the testimony of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it discusses the cost of expert witnesses, not the fairness of juries.
  None of the choices weakens the argument, but choice A is the most relevant to the argument.

Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument?
Choices:
  A: Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers.
  B: Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation.
  C: It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum.
  D: Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
  E: Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants.
Response 0:

Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone.
  B: Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true.
  C: Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill.
  D: When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
  E: Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The student argues that if people are not affected by a microorganism, then they have immunity to it.
  The student assumes that the absence of harmful symptoms means that the person has immunity to the microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because not all people who are exposed to staphylococcus have immunity to it.
  Therefore, the student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The student argues that since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  The argument is flawed because the fact that many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms does not necessarily mean that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism.
  The pattern of reasoning in the student's argument is most similar to the pattern of reasoning in option C.
  In option C, the speaker assumes that medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and therefore concludes that Isabel did not take the medication because she is still quite ill.

Topic: Law
Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects.
Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds?
Choices:
  A: It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  B: It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug.
  C: It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects.
  D: It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.

Topic: Law
Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above?
Choices:
  A: Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently.
  B: The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain.
  C: Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today.
  D: The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.
  E: Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The apparent conflict is that the food resources that could support the high-calorie diet were not available in the savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the lack of food resources that could support the high-calorie diet.
  Answer choice E provides a possible explanation for this conflict by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

This statement suggests that early humans might have avoided shore environments because gathering food there required too much energy, which could explain why the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas instead of shore environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

Topic: Law
Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more "accidents."
Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to
Choices:
  A: question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice
  B: point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses

Topic: Law
Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs?
Choices:
  A: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work.
  B: Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
  C: The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome.
  D: Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work.
  E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

Topic: Law
Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out.
Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above?
Choices:
  A: Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed.
  B: Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds.
  C: My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
  D: The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong.
  E: Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted.

Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails.
Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed?
Choices:
  A: Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress.

Topic: Law
Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument?
Choices:
  A: The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals.
  B: Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward.
  C: It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain.
  D: Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
  E: Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that Diplodocus could not have raised its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument is based on the computer models that show the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement.
  The argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  An assumption required by the argument would be something that must be true for the argument to hold.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is a possibility, but the argument does not depend on it.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because the argument concludes that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. If Diplodocus was able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them, then the argument would not hold.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument states that Diplodocus could not raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation.
  The argument also states that Diplodocus could bend its neck downward and extend it below ground level to access underwater vegetation.
  Therefore, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  The assumption required by the argument should be a statement that connects the inability to raise its neck to browse for high-growing vegetation with the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not mentioned in the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not necessary because the argument already provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation.
  Choice E is relevant to the argument because it provides an alternative way for Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation, which would weaken the conclusion that Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

Topic: Law
Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments?
Choices:
  A: Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
  B: Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  C: Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer.
  D: Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  E: The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
Response 0:
Thought:
The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 
Option A: The argument is valid as it states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
Option B: The argument is valid as it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Option C: The argument is not valid as it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. However, the principle does not state that if an offer is legitimate, then the other party will accept it.
Option D: The argument is valid as it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
Option E: The argument is not valid as it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. However, the principle does not state that if an offer is not legitimate, then there is no valid contract between the parties.
 
Therefore, the answer is either A or B. 
Action: Answer("B")

Option D: The argument is valid as it states that Hai's offer was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest.
Option E: The argument is invalid as it states that Sal's offer was not legitimate, but it does not provide any information on whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Therefore, the answer is either A or B. 
Between A and B, B is a better answer as it directly relates to the principle stated in the question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A is incorrect because it only talks about a legitimate offer and does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Option B is correct because it talks about an offer made in jest and how it affects the validity of the contract.
Option C is incorrect because it only talks about a legitimate offer and does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Option D is correct because it talks about an offer that was not made in jest and how it affects the validity of the contract.
Option E is incorrect because it only talks about a non-legitimate offer and does not mention whether the offer was made in jest or not.
Therefore, the answer is either B or D.

  Option B is correct because it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
  Option C is incorrect because it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. However, the principle stated above is about the legitimacy of the offer, not the reasonableness of the person accepting the offer.
  Option D is correct because it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
  Option E is incorrect because it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. However, it does not provide any information about the legitimacy of the offer.

  The principle stated above says that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
  Option A talks about a legitimate offer and Sandy not rejecting the offer, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option B talks about an offer made in jest, which makes it not valid.
  Option C talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Option D talks about an offer that was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest, which makes it a valid contract.
  Option E talks about an offer that was not legitimate, but it does not mention if the offer was made in jest or not.
  Therefore, the principle stated above most helps to justify the reasoning in option B.

Topic: Law
Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader.
Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true?
Choices:
  A: All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature.
  B: Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader.
  C: Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed.
  D: Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views.
  E: Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.

Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument?
Choices:
  A: For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries.
  B: Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches.
  C: Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect.
  D: The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
  E: Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise.
Response 0:

Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class.
Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays.
  B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.
  C: In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species.
  D: Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
  E: The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it does not consider the total number of sociology and psychology majors at Morris University.
  The argument assumes that the number of sociology majors taking the class is greater than the number of psychology majors taking the class, which may not be true.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the majority of Silver Falls residents are in favor of spending more on roads based on the fact that more residents said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than on parks, without considering the total number of residents.

Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which is not necessarily true.

Response 9:
Thought:
  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most sociology majors are taking the class while most psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students taking the class is proportional to the number of majors in each field, which may not be true.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the number of residents in favor of spending more on roads is proportional to the number of residents opposed to spending more on parks.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that how people compare themselves to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness, and people tend to overinvest in acquiring material possessions at the expense of leisure due to the phenomenon of rivalry.
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value.
  The question asks to compare the terms that each passage would use to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  Neither of the passages describe wanting to make more money than one's neighbors as insular, altruistic, happy, misguided, lucky or primitive.
  Passage B argues that wanting to create value by earning more money is admirable.
  Therefore, Passage B would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The answer is D: admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry and how people want to be richer than their neighbors.
  Passage B supports the idea that people want to create value, which makes them feel successful and happy.
  None of the pairs of terms seems to fit accurately what the authors from both passages are trying to convey.
  However, it is possible to infer from the context that the authors from passage B would consider the behavior of wanting to create value and be successful as "admirable."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both discuss the phenomenon of people comparing their income with others in their society.
  In Passage A, people are described as having a "required income" that correlates with their actual income. This suggests that people are not necessarily trying to make more money than their neighbors, but rather that they are trying to match the income of others in their society.
  In Passage B, the authors argue that people want to create value and feel successful, rather than simply wanting to make more money than their neighbors.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is either altruistic or egocentric, happy or miserable, misguided or admirable, or lucky or primitive.
  Therefore, "none of the above" is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B talk about a person's desire to acquire more wealth to be happier.
  The authors of Passage A describe this desire as natural, but also highlight that it might lead to higher required income, and subsequently, to a higher reference group.  
  The authors of Passage B also talk about the desire to earn more, but from the perspective of creating value and feeling successful.  
  None of the given pairs of terms are directly related to the idea of acquiring more wealth or the desire to be successful. 
  Therefore, none of the given options seems to be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B discuss the phenomenon of people wanting to make more money than their neighbors.
  According to Passage A, people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. This phenomenon is called rivalry, which is crucial for happiness.
  According to Passage B, earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. Wanting to create value benefits society. 
  Therefore, both passages imply that a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is motivated by the desire to create value and feel successful.
  The authors do not use terms such as "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "egocentric," "misguided," "admirable," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe such a person.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B talk about the phenomenon of wanting to have more than others.
  They explain why people want to have more than others and how it relates to happiness and success.
  Passage A describes the phenomenon of rivalry and how it affects people's happiness.
  Passage B explains that wanting to have more than others is really evidence of a desire to create value.
  Based on the context, neither passage seems to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as being altruistic, egocentric, happy, miserable, lucky, or primitive.
  Based on the context, the authors of the passages do not appear to describe such a person as insular or cosmopolitan.
  Therefore, None of the Above is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains the phenomenon of habituation and rivalry which push up the norm and how people compare their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. The passage also explains that how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value and wanting to create value benefits society. 
  The author of Passage B states that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are not necessarily egocentric, rather it is evidence of a desire to create value. 
  Therefore, the most likely pair of terms that would be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is misguided and admirable.
  The answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A explains that people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income.
  The phenomenon of rivalry shows that people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  The desire to create value is evidence of an admirable tendency.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B would most likely use the pair of terms "misguided" and "admirable", respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A and B both discuss the concept of wanting to make more money than one's neighbors.
  The authors disagree on the reason for this desire, with passage A proposing the notion of rivalry and one-upmanship, while passage B suggests that people feel happier when they are successful and feel that they create value.
  Neither passage uses terms like "insular," "cosmopolitan," "altruistic," "lucky," or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  It is unlikely that the authors of passage A and B would use the term "happy" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors, as the passages suggest that wanting more money can lead to dissatisfaction and misery.
  Likewise, it is unlikely that the authors would use the term "misguided" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors, as passage B suggests that wanting to create value is a beneficial desire.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B discuss the reasons behind why people want to earn more money than their neighbors.
  Passage A mentions the phenomenon of rivalry and how people want to improve their relative position in society.
  Passage B mentions how people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous and have created value.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is altruistic or admirable.
  Passage B argues that the desire to create value benefits society.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric.
  The answer is B: egocentric.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where larger scale enterprises have lower costs per unit than smaller scale enterprises.
  The passage uses the example of a pin factory to illustrate increasing returns to scale in the second paragraph. It states that the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
  Choice A is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it describes the productivity of editors, not the productivity of an enterprise.
  Choice B is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it describes a process that enables a large colony to better divide up work, rather than a process that reduces costs per unit.
  Choice C is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it describes an increase in the total number of students that can be accommodated by a school district, not a reduction in costs per unit.
  Choice D is an example of increasing returns to scale because it describes how advances in technology enable the lobster industry to catch more lobsters each day with the same number of traps.
  Choice E is not an example of increasing returns to scale because it describes how one large colony of ants divides into two smaller colonies, which then divide into more colonies, leading to an overall increase in the total number of ants, not a reduction in costs per unit.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale refer to the concept of higher production output per worker as the size of the factory increases. This means that as the size of the firm grows, the workers can specialize on more narrow tasks, resulting in higher productivity.
  Option A is incorrect because it describes a decrease in productivity.
  Option B is incorrect because it describes a scenario where the bees are able to divide their labor more effectively, but it doesn't mention an increase in productivity.
  Option C doesn't describe an increase in productivity, but rather an increase in the number of students that can be accommodated.
  Option D doesn't relate to the concept of increasing returns to scale since it only mentions advancements in technology.
  Option E doesn't mention firms or production, so it's also unrelated to increasing returns to scale.
  The most appropriate answer is D because it describes a scenario where advances in technology allow for an increase in the number of lobsters caught per trap, which means that more lobsters are caught per unit of labor, leading to an increase in productivity.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale are described as the concept that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more units the factory can produce per worker. 
  Option A talks about relaxing the standards for editors, which is not related to specialization and increasing returns to scale.
  Option B talks about bees guarding nectar sources, which is not related to increasing returns to scale in factories.
  Option C talks about scheduling students in a school district, which is not related to increasing returns to scale in factories.
  Option D talks about advancements in technology that allow the lobster industry to catch more lobsters, but it does not discuss the size of the lobster industry and how it relates to increasing returns to scale.
  Option E talks about the growth of ant colonies, which is not related to the production of goods in factories.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that with increasing size, a business can become more efficient and productive.
  The example of the pin factory in the passage illustrates this concept.
  So, we need to find an option that shows that with an increase in size, a particular business can become more efficient and productive.
  (A) describes reducing the workforce, which does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  (B) is about bees and describes a division of labor, but it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  (C) describes a method of accomodating more students in a single building, but it does not talk about anything becoming more efficient with a larger size.
  (D) talks about an increase in the number of lobsters that can be caught with the same number of traps because of advances in technology. This is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  (E) describes the division of a colony into two competing colonies that grow in size, but it does not illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as the phenomenon where bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business because of lower costs and higher efficiency due to scale.
  Among the choices, option B explains that a large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, allowing the colony to collect more nectar and feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  This example shows how a larger entity can use the same resources more efficiently to exponentially increase its output.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states that increasing returns to scale mean that larger businesses can produce more per worker.
  The example of the pin factory given in the passage illustrates the concept of increasing returns.
  Of the choices, only B, D, and E describe situations where there is an increase in productivity due to specialization or some other factor.
  A and C do not appear to have to do with returns to scale.
  None of the choices seem to have to do with the natural tendency towards monopoly mentioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the best option that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is described in the second paragraph.
  According to the paragraph, increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and the more products they can produce per worker.
  So, the correct answer should describe a situation that promotes increased productivity with more workers.
  Answer choice A describes a lower standard of work, which would not lead to increased productivity.
  Answer choice B describes a situation where fewer worker bees are needed, so it does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice C describes a scenario based on time management and increased efficiency but does not describe increased productivity with more workers.
  Answer choice D describes the use of new technology to increase lobster catch, but it does not describe increased productivity with more workers.
  Answer choice E describes a situation where more colonies of ants are produced, which contain more ants than could have existed in one colony, indicating increased productivity with more workers.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale refer to the idea that as a business grows larger, its workers can specialize more and become more productive. This productivity gain results in the ability to produce more than the sum of the output that the individual workers could produce when working independently.
  In the example given in the second paragraph, a pin factory's employees can produce far more pins than they could if each worked independently because of specialization.
  Therefore, the choice that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale is the one where workers can specialize more and become more productive as a business grows larger.
  The choice that best illustrates this concept is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The second paragraph of the passage describes increasing returns to scale.
  According to the passage, increasing returns to scale refer to the fact that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore, the more productive the factory can be.
  Among the given choices, answer B describes an increase in productivity due to a more specialized workforce.
  Therefore, the best illustration of the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is illustrated in the second paragraph of the passage with the example of a pin factory.
  The example explains that there are increasing returns to scale, meaning the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker.
  Another example that could illustrate increasing returns to scale would be one in which a larger operation yields a greater output per unit of input, leading to lower costs and higher profits.
  Option A describes a situation in which a publishing house is able to employ fewer editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This does not explain how a larger operation leads to lower costs and higher profits, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option B describes a situation in which a large bee colony is able to collect more nectar because some bees are solely designated to guard the nectar sources. This does not explain how a larger operation leads to lower costs and higher profits, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes a situation in which a school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time. This does not explain how a larger operation leads to lower costs and higher profits, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option D describes a situation in which the lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This explains how a larger operation leads to lower costs and higher profits, so it is a possible example of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes a situation in which a large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony. This does not explain how a larger operation leads to lower costs and higher profits, so it is not an example of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work

Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought:
The author claims that Toni Morrison was the first African American writer to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
The author compares the structuring of Jazz to how Duke Ellington constructed his compositions.
The author describes how the narration of Jazz is "analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances".
The comparison between the structuring of Jazz and Duke Ellington's compositions suggests that the author is making an analogy between the two, implying that Morrison is like Ellington in some way.
If A were true, it would support the author's claim that Morrison intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance.
If B, C, D, or E were true, they would not provide evidence to support the author's claim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The author claims that Toni Morrison was the first African American writer to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. This is clear from lines 7-10.
The author claims that Jazz's narration is similar in structure to the playing of a jazz hand, which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances. This is clear from lines 18-25.
The author claims that Morrison has achieved the same effect as Duke Ellington in constructing his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. This is clear from lines 26-31.
Therefore, the author is most likely arguing that the use of jazz as the structuring principle for a novel can be compared to the way in which Duke Ellington composed his music, with a combination of ensemble and individuality in mind.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:

  The passage describes a debate regarding the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  Two sides of the debate are presented: one suggests changing societal norms and institutions and rehabilitating those convicted of deliberate crimes, while the other suggests increasing fines and penalties and strengthening law enforcement.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile the two positions and demonstrate that they are not fundamentally in conflict.
  Therefore, the passage is organized around two sides of a debate that are reconciled by an economic principle.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate about how to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side thinks that people's beliefs and economic opportunities should change in order to reduce crime.
  The other side thinks that increasing fines, penalties, and law enforcement is the best way to deter crime.
  A recent economic principle, utility maximization, shows that the two sides are complementary.
  The economic principle is used to analyze the rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  The two sides of the debate are shown to have the same overall effect.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes a debate on deterrence methods for deliberate crimes.
  One side of the debate believes in societal change as a deterrent, while the other side believes in stronger penalties and law enforcement.
  The economic principle of utility maximization is introduced to reconcile the two positions.
  The principle is applied to show that the two approaches are complementary, rather than antithetical.
  Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage outlines a debate about crime deterrence.
  The first side of the debate believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals and suggest changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime.
  The second side of the debate believes that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice and suggest increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement.
  The passage introduces an economic principle, the utility maximization principle, as a way to reconcile the two positions, suggesting that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The passage then applies the utility maximization principle to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  The passage shows that the two crime-deterrence methods (increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement and increasing economic opportunities) have the same overall effect in terms of lowering the expected utility from criminal activity.
  Therefore, the passage describes two sides of a debate and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes two sides of a debate and introduces an economic principle to reconcile them.
  The passage starts by introducing the debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  It then describes the two sides of the debate.
  The passage then introduces the economic principle of utility maximization.
  The rest of the passage shows how this principle reconciles the two positions and demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is best described as Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two sides of a debate.
  It introduces a general economic principle that reconciles the two positions.
  The two positions are analyzed to show that they are complementary.
  The optimal approach to crime deterrence is said to include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Therefore, the structure of the passage is most accurately described as:
Action: Answer("A")

  The passage discusses a problem in the legal community regarding deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  The author describes two sides of the debate and their recommendations.
  The author introduces an economic principle and explains how it reconciles the two sides.
  The author concludes that the optimal approach to deterrence would include elements of both sides.
  The passage is organized around the two sides of the debate and the economic principle that reconciles them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage presents two different views on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes that changes in societal norms and institutions could reduce the crime rate, while the other side believe that increasing punishment and fines for crimes along with strong law enforcement is the way to go.
  A recent legal scholarship introduces the economic principle of utility maximization to reconcile the two sides.
  This principle states that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect, as they both affect the utility equation, making it less likely for a person to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  The optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  In the passage, it is mentioned that astronomers discovered the planet Neptune after they made observations that failed to match their predictions of Uranus's orbit.
  The discovery of Neptune is based on the calculations of Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  In choice A, Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  In choice B, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This discovery is not based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets, so it is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  In choice C, Walter Alvarez's postulation about the extinction of the dinosaurs is based on observations of high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  In choice D, Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  In choice E, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during the decay of a neutron. This is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: "Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past."
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The question asks which scientific episode is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune.
  According to passage B, astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions when attempting to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  Since the predictions were incorrect, they hypothesized the existence of another planet, which they called Neptune, and discovered it in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the answer is the scientific episode that follows a similar pattern.
  Option A is about Galileo falsely predicting that there is only one high tide per day.
  Option B is about Edwin Hubble discovering that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right.
  Option C is about Walter Alvarez postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of dinosaurs.
  Option D is about Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field.
  Option E is about Wolfgang Pauli postulating that a third undetected particle is also created during neutron decay, and the particle's existence was later confirmed.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is Option D, Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune involved making predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The predictions were incorrect due to the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
  Scientists hypothesized the existence of the planet, and it was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Analogous scientific episodes are the ones where predictions based on a hypothesis were not borne out, leading to the hypothesizing of the existence of something, which was later confirmed.
  Among the given choices, option C seems irrelevant to this context.
  Option A, B, D, and E do involve making predictions based on a hypothesis, which did not match the observations and led to the hypothesizing of something else, which was later confirmed.
  But option E is about discovering a new particle during a decay, which is not similar to discovering a planet due to an error in predictions.
  Option A is about Galileo's theory of tides but is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Option B is about discovering Andromeda as a galaxy, but it is not related to predictions or hypotheses.
  Option D is about the reversal of Earth's magnetic field, but it is not related to predictions or hypotheses regarding the orbit of a planet.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. Galileo's theory was based on a hypothesis that was not borne out, and the discovery of two high tides per day led to the discovery of the correct explanation for tides.
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of another planet based on observations that were inconsistent with their predictions.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune, and then later discovered it.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a planet based on hypothesis to explain inconsistencies in observations.
  Answer choices A, C, D, and E do not fit this analogy.
  Answer choice B is about discovering a new galaxy by observing variable stars, which does not involve predicting the existence of an object based on inconsistencies in observations.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet based on discrepancies in their predictions and observations, then later discovered the planet, which explains the discrepancies.
  Option A describes how Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  Option B describes how Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right by observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness.
  Option C describes how Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples, later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  Option D describes how Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, concluding that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  Option E describes how Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is created during the decay of neutrons into protons and electrons, and the particle's existence was later confirmed.
  The scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune involves discrepancies in predictions and observations leading to the hypothesis of the existence of another planet, which is later discovered. Therefore, the answer is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact, there are two. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  In passage B, scientists discovered Neptune by hypothesizing the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Neptune was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one where scientists hypothesize the existence of something, and then later discover it in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The only choice that matches this description is choice E, where Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third undetected particle during a neutron decay, and later the particle's existence was confirmed.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The analogy should be related to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B.
  In Passage B, the discovery of Neptune was based on astronomers' predictions of the orbit of Uranus.
  Astronomers made predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the orbit of Uranus.
  Their predictions were incorrect, leading them to hypothesize the existence of another planet, Neptune.
  They later discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the answer is the scientific episode that involves the discovery of a new planet based on its influence on the orbit of another planet.
  The only choice that matches this description is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes Popper's philosophy of science, which emphasizes the importance of negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B describes how scientists discovered the planet Neptune using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  An analogous scientific episode would involve scientists making a prediction that turned out to be incorrect, and then modifying their assumptions to explain the discrepancy before discovering a new phenomenon.
  Option A describes a false prediction about ocean tides made by Galileo, but does not involve the discovery of a new phenomenon.
  Option B describes the discovery of Andromeda as a galaxy, but does not involve making predictions or modifying assumptions.
  Option C describes a postulation by Walter Alvarez about the extinction of the dinosaurs, but does not involve making predictions based on auxiliary assumptions.
  Option D describes Bernard Brunhes' discovery of reversed magnetic fields in rocks, but does not involve making predictions or modifying assumptions.
  Option E describes Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of an undetected particle, which was later confirmed, but does not involve making predictions or modifying assumptions.
  Therefore, Option B is not analogous to the scientific episode described in Passage B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune is described in the passage B.
  The astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers found that the predicted orbit for Uranus was incorrect.
  The astronomers changed their assumption about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Neptune was later discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The discovery of Neptune was due to a failure of the assumption about the existence of other planets.
  Analogously, we need to find the scientific episode where a bad assumption was made and this led to a discovery.
  
Action: Answer("B") 
  The scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B, is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  In passage B, astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on calculations and the observation of Uranus' orbit, and later discovered Neptune in the precise place necessitated by those calculations. 
  In option A, Galileo's theory of tides was falsified by the observation of two high tides per day instead of one.
  In option B, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is a galaxy in its own right, settling a debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  In option C, Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered supporting his theory.
  In option D, Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, and concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  In option E, Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of an undetected particle, which was later confirmed to exist.
  Option A, B, C, D does not seem to be analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in passage B.
  Option E is more about postulation of undetected particles and confirmation of its existence, which is not related to the prediction and discovery of Neptune's orbit.
  Therefore, none of the options are analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in passage B.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 0.8 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not a reliable basis for guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues against the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  Instead, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that emphasizes the principle of saving lives, rather than the distinction between voluntary and involuntary.
  Choice A emphasizes the dangerous and socially useless purpose of some activities, not the principle of saving lives.
  Choice B emphasizes the relevance of the victim's choice to fly, which is contrary to the author's argument.
  Choice C provides no relevant information about the author's position on the issue.
  Choice D is consistent with the author's argument that voluntariness is not an all-or-nothing matter, but one of degree.

  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always useful when making regulatory policy decisions. Instead, the government should focus on saving as many lives as it can with the limited resources it has.
The author does not support the idea that people should not be protected against risks from dangerous activities that do not serve a socially useful purpose like skydiving.
The author also argues that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly is relevant to decisions about government regulation of air safety.
The author does not make any claims about the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury in plane crashes or other risks.
The author argues that for public-policy purposes, the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear-cut and that it is not an all-or-nothing matter.
Therefore, the most likely answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is often arbitrary and not particularly helpful in guiding policy decisions. 
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can while taking into account limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
  The author does not take a stance on whether people should be protected against the risks incurred through activities that are dangerous and socially useless, or whether the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  The author suggests that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred, and that characterizing risks as voluntary or involuntary often stems from confusion or selective attention. 
  Based on the above, the author would most likely agree with the statement that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. Therefore, the answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.

Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not as important as people think.
  That regulatory policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible.

  The author suggests that judgments about whether a risk is voluntary or involuntary often stem from confusion and selective attention and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes the way that FMRI scans are interpreted.
  FMRI scans are subtracted by taking a baseline measurement and a second measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement, and whatever remains represents the metabolic activity only associated with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Thus, the question asks for the analogy to the way FMRI scans are interpreted.
  Option B describes a situation where an increase in shoppers during the summer was assumed to have been affected by a yearlong advertising campaign.
  However, it is possible that the increase in shoppers during the summer was due to other factors, such as seasonality.
  This is analogous to the way FMRI scans are interpreted because it assumes that the difference between the baseline measurement and the on-task measurement is only due to the cognitive task, when in reality, other factors may be at play.
  Therefore, the most analogous answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans work.
  According to the passage, FMRI scans produce images of the brain at work using a subtractive method.
  The FMRI scans take a baseline measurement and a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, then the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The remaining measurement is interpreted as the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the analogical choice is likely to describe a process that obscures some relevant information.
  Choice D describes how most internet traffic during peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings, which is not analogous to the process described in the passage.
  Choice C describes how the agricultural sector is impacted most severely when droughts occur because agricultural customers use much more of the water supply than residential customers, which is not analogous to the process described in the passage.
  Choice E describes how most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances, which is not analogous to the process described in the passage.
  Choice A describes how one particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district, which is not analogous to the process described in the passage.
  Choice B describes how a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers, which is analogous to the process described in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes FMRI scans as a way to measure the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI scans are usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and it depicts the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method of subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the interpretation of FMRI scans is analogous to subtracting one measurement from another to isolate the effect of a specific variable, such that the remaining difference represents the effect of that variable alone.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage explains that brain scans show only differential rates of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
The scans are interpreted as a map of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
This interpretation is based on a subtraction method that subtracts out all the distributed brain functions.
This method produces striking images of the brain at work but may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
Action: Answer("B") 
Choice B is the best analogy because it involves an increase in shoppers only during the summer, which means that the advertisement affects only summer shoppers. Similarly, the FMRI scan shows only the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain while the subject is performing some cognitive tasks.
Response 4:
Thought:
The paragraph explains that FMRI scans depict differential rate of oxygen, where the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
The subtractive method is used to separate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
This method can be compared to the process where one analyzes the impact of a specific factor by removing it from the overall situation and comparing the results.
Choice B is similar to the process of removing a factor (advertisements) and observing its impact on the outcome (increase in shoppers).
Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The FMRI scan provides a map of the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
  A problem with this method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks to identify the analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Among the choices, option B provides the most analogous analogy, where the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  Similarly, the FMRI scan shows only the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The interpretation of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and it produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The question asks to identify a scenario that is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Among the choices, the most analogous scenario is the one that involves subtracting one quantity from another to obtain a result that is relevant to the analysis.
  Choice B is an example of such a scenario where an increase in shoppers during the summer was attributed solely to a yearlong advertising campaign based on the subtraction of the number of shoppers in other seasons.
  The other choices do not involve subtracting quantities to obtain a relevant result, so they are not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The article describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  FMRI scans of brain activity are actually the result of a subtraction.
  The subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  So, we need to find an option that describes a method of interpretation that gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Option B describes a situation where an increase in shoppers was observed only during the summer, leading to the conclusion that advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  This is similar to the situation described in the article where a subtraction method leads to the conclusion that only certain parts of the brain are active during certain cognitive tasks, even though the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question is asking us to identify an analogy for the way FMRI scans are typically interpreted.
  The passage tells us that FMRI scans use a subtraction method to show the metabolic activity associated with a specific cognitive task. 
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  An analogy for this process would be a situation where one thing is isolated or highlighted, obscuring the fact that other things are also present and active.
  Option (A) compares to a district is important for the mayoral candidate, but does not acknowledge the impact of other districts.
  Option (B) is similar, but it doesn't acknowledge the impact of the advertising campaign outside of the summer months.
  Option (C) is also similar, but it doesn't acknowledge the impact of water supply usage by other sectors.
  Option (D) compares to a specific time of day, but it doesn't acknowledge internet traffic during other hours.
  Option (E) compares to the speed of cheetahs over short distances, but it doesn't acknowledge their abilities over long distances.
  The best analogy is Option (A).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes the subtractive method used in interpreting functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans.
  The method subtracts a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to isolate the metabolic activity solely associated with the cognitive task.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the question is asking for an option that describes a similar process of subtraction to isolate a specific quantity.
  Option A describes subtracting one district's votes to see the effect on the mayoral election.
  Option B describes subtracting the effect of advertising on customers who shopped in the summer.
  Option C describes finding the impact on the agricultural sector by subtracting the residential customer's water usage.
  Option D describes subtracting the internet traffic in offices to find the peak-hour traffic originating from homes.
  Option E describes finding that the cheetah cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
The critics discussed in the second paragraph believe that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. They argue that not all cultures share liberal values, and their value systems cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. They also criticize the second version of multicultural education that adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, but still uses the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. Critics argue that these methods are already value-laden, and insisting on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. 
Action: Answer("E") 
Therefore, the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 1:
Thought:
The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is not possible if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. They claim that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden; hence, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. The critics argue that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Option A is incorrect because the critics do not argue that members of a culture with different values cannot understand the historical and social circumstances that give rise to a culture's values.
Option B is not the answer because it is a general statement about culture and values but does not capture the essence of the argument made by the critics.
Option C is incorrect because the critics argue that genuine understanding can be achieved only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, not by adopting multiple cultural perspectives.
Option D is not the answer because the critics do not argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
Option E is incorrect because while the critics argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and thus cannot adequately understand non-Western cultures' values, they do not argue that values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
The best answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The objection to the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first, and is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Thus, critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph believe that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and that the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Therefore, these critics are most likely to agree that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that multicultural education should adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied in order to achieve a real understanding. 
This objection is based on the belief that the Western scientific heritage is not the only way to understand the world and that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden. 
Therefore, the critics who raise this objection would most likely agree with the statement that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values. 
The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph points out that trying to understand other cultures by Western scientific methods alone is not enough to understand non-Western cultures. It is limiting to approach multicultural education solely from within the Western scientific perspective. Since the objection is in response to the second version of multicultural education, which adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures, critics of the objection would likely agree with this stance.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The objection raised in the second paragraph argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden. To understand other cultures, it is important to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied, which are often nonscientific. 
Option A is too broad and contradicts the objection discussed in the passage. Option B is partially correct but does not address the objection discussed in the passage. Option C is incorrect because it is not mentioned in the passage. Option D is incorrect because the objection discussed in the passage is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if we approach them solely from the majority culture's perspective. Option E is a plausible restatement of the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The critics of the second form of multicultural education believe that the Western scientific perspective is not suitable for examining and understanding non-Western cultures.
This is because the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
Thus, the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is therefore not only distorting but also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
Therefore, the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is related to the idea that the second version of multicultural education should adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and examine them using Western scientific methods. Critics argue that this approach is not essentially different from the first one that examines other cultures using the methods of the majority culture. 
The objection is rooted in the belief that non-scientific cultures cannot be understood by Western scientific methods. 
Option A is incorrect as it states that members of a different culture cannot understand the social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values. 
Option B is not directly related to the objection discussed in the second paragraph. While it is true that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values, this is not the main point of the objection. 
Option C is also not related to the objection discussed in the second paragraph. 
Option D is contrary to the argument made in the objection that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. 
Option E, on the other hand, is in line with the argument made in the objection that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
  The objection states that genuine understanding of other cultures cannot be achieved if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective.
  The critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that Western scientific methods for the study of cultures are already value laden and that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. 
  According to the critics, to insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.
  Therefore, the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with choice E, which states that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
The second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures and the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
Critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.
Response 0:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how the presence of secondary substances has given plants their distinctive tastes and smells.

Thought:
The passage discusses the two types of chemical substances in plants and how they differ in function, the role of insects in the evolution of secondary substances in plants as a chemical defense mechanism, and the resulting competition between plants and insects. 
The primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances, consisting of diverse chemicals, give plants their characteristic smells and tastes. 
Secondary substances arise by genetic mutations and survive natural selection because they attract pollinating insects, serve as biochemical defenses, or dissuade insects through characteristic smells or tastes. 
Insects must adapt to plants' defenses, leading to a competition between plants and insects, resulting in a narrowing of the range of secondary substances. 
The main point of the passage is to describe the evolutionary relationship between plants and insects through the development of secondary substances.

The passage discusses the primary and secondary chemical substances in plants and their role in plants' growth and metabolism, as well as their role in plants' interactions with insects. It explains that the secondary substances give plants their distinctive taste and smell and that insects played a significant role in the evolution of these substances. The competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of suitable food sources for insects, which are often narrowly defined and specific to botanically related groups of plants. 
Choice A is too narrowly focused on the relationship between secondary substances and insects, and it does not address the broader context of the passage.
Choice B is too specific to the narrowing of secondary substances and insect species range and does not effectively summarize the broader context of the passage.
Choice C correctly summarizes the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances and how this process has led to the distinctive tastes and smells of present-day plants.
Choice D is incorrect because it erroneously suggests that secondary substances tend to be similar among closely related species, but the passage states that only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant.
Choice E is too broad and does not adequately capture the main point of the passage, which is the interaction between plants and insects in the development of secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Thought:
The 'cognitive framework' mentioned in line 58 is being discussed to:
  - inform readers about the limitations of the 'stealing thunder' strategy.
  - explain how jurors create a bias for subsequent information based on early information.
  - explain how jurors create a more positive impression when information is framed positively early in a trial.
  - discuss the effectiveness of the "scarce commodity" concept in the courtroom.
  - discuss the value of credibility in creating a more persuasive message.
  
Line 58 states that the cognitive framework of jurors is formed based on early information, which can influence how they evaluate information presented later in the trial. Therefore, the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses cognitive framework in the context of stealing thunder.
  Stealing thunder is the strategy to reveal negative information before the opposition does or before it is elicited.
  Stealing thunder can work because people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive.
  Jurors who often initially have little information about a case, can be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
  Therefore, the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  The answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first one because the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
To provide an objection to this criticism, we need to show that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first one.
Option A is irrelevant because it talks about adopting the perspectives and methods of another culture, which is not the subject of the criticism.
Option B is also irrelevant because it talks about the similarity among non-Western societies, which does not necessarily establish a difference between the two versions of multicultural education.
Option C is also irrelevant because it talks about the use of a non-Western society's value system when studying cultures that have different values, which is not the subject of the criticism.
Option D is also irrelevant because it talks about the understanding of a Western society's achievements, which is not the subject of the criticism.
Option E is the most relevant because it talks about the necessity of genuine understanding of another culture for appreciating that culture. If students can achieve genuine understanding of other cultures, then it can be argued that the second version of multicultural education is essentially different from the first one.
Therefore, the answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still identifiably Western, even though it advocates adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures.
  The objection to this criticism is that it is possible to adopt the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures when studying other cultures.
  The strongest objection to the criticism would be evidence that the second version of multicultural education has effectively adopted the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures.
  Choice C provides such evidence by stating that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still relies on Western scientific methods of examination, which are value-laden.
  The objection is that to truly understand another culture, we must adopt their perspective and methods of examination. 
  Therefore, the strongest objection to this criticism would be to show that understanding another culture is not necessary for appreciating that culture.
  Choice E asserts that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. This contradicts the proposed objection.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that the methods used to understand other cultures in the West are already value-laden.
  The Western scientific heritage is founded on an epistemological system that is not shared by other cultures.
  The discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often dominant in non-Western cultures.
  To insist on trying to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The question is asking for the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
    Option A is not relevant to the criticism or the argument in the passage.
    Option B is irrelevant because it does not address the argument about the methods of understanding cultures.
    Option C does not address the argument that the methods used to understand other cultures in the West are value-laden.
    Option D is irrelevant because it is not related to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
    Option E does not provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  None of the options provide a strong objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first one, because it still adopts methods that are identifiably Western.
  The objection against this criticism is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is not necessary for real understanding, then that would weaken the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice A is irrelevant because it argues that it is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of another culture, which does not address the objection raised.
  Choice B is also irrelevant because it talks about the similarity between non-Western societies, which is not related to the objection raised.
  Choice C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying other cultures, which does not directly address the objection raised.
  Choice D is irrelevant because it talks about the understanding of Western culture's achievements, which is not related to the objection raised.
  Choice E is also irrelevant because it merely restates the importance of genuine understanding, which is not related to the objection raised.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The criticism against the second version of multicultural education is that it uses Western scientific perspective and heritage to understand non-Western cultures.
  Critics argue that understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  If one of the answer choices shows that the second version of multicultural education is not grounded in the Western scientific perspective and heritage, then it would provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
  Choice C states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  This suggests that some non-Western societies may have developed their own methods and perspectives that are different from Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  Therefore, choice C would provide the strongest objection to the criticism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument is that the second version of multicultural education is problematic because it uses Western methods to study non-Western cultures.
  Critics believe that real understanding of a culture can only be achieved through the use of the culture's own methods and perspectives.
  If there were evidence that using Western methods to study non-Western cultures can still lead to genuine understanding, it would weaken the objection.
  Option D is irrelevant to the objection.
  Option B and C do not address the issue of using Western methods to study non-Western cultures.
  Option A is a counterargument against using non-Western methods to study non-Western cultures, and thus, does not support the second version of multicultural education.
  Option E supports the argument of the critics of the second version of multicultural education.
  The best option that weakens the objection is A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still Western in its methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  The objection to this criticism is that real understanding can be achieved by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism of the second version of multicultural education, the answer should provide evidence that demonstrates how adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures in studying those cultures is not necessary for achieving genuine understanding.
  Choice A does not provide evidence that demonstrates how adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures in studying those cultures is not necessary for achieving genuine understanding.
  Choice B does not provide evidence that demonstrates how adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures in studying those cultures is not necessary for achieving genuine understanding.
  Choice C does not provide evidence that demonstrates how adopting the perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures in studying those cultures is not necessary for achieving genuine understanding.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the criticism and objection of the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice E is a restatement of the objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations. This statement does not support the objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education, and therefore is the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education argues that it is not essentially different from the first because it still uses Western scientific methods that are already value-laden.
  The criticism suggests that to achieve real understanding, one needs to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, the best objection to this criticism would be an argument that the second version of multicultural education does not need to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve genuine understanding.
  Choice C can provide this objection as it suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it adopts the Western scientific perspective and heritage for examining non-Western cultures.
  The objection to this criticism is that real understanding can be achieved only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education would be one that provides evidence that adopting non-Western perspectives and methods is unnecessary for real understanding.
  Option D is irrelevant and does not address the criticism or objection.
  Option A is not a strong objection because it is possible to adopt perspectives and methods of a culture without being a member of that culture.
  Option B and C do not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option E does not provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  None of the given choices provide a strong objection to the criticism in the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.

Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage states that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  To be analogous to Schoenberg's music, the disturbing element in the question stem should also be able to express emotional states in a way that is new to its field.
  A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor and a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians are not analogous to Schoenberg's music because they do not express new emotions.
  A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy may be disturbing but it is not analogous to Schoenberg's music.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore is the most analogous to Schoenberg's music because it expresses new emotions and truths that are not commonly encountered.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture

  According to the objection, it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  The objection is against the use of Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph presents the view of critics of the second version of multicultural education.
  These critics argue that using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, it is most likely that proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would object to a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first version of multicultural education holds that schools should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, while using the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture.
  The second version argues that the values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination and study of cultures in this second version are still Western.
  The passage mentions that critics of the second form of multicultural education argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. 
  According to the objection mentioned in the passage, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Among the given choices, C is the only option that describes a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture, which is objectionable to the proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  This version is criticized for using Western scientific methods to study non-Western cultures.
  Critics argue that using Western scientific methods is still an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would be objectionable to proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that a rational economic choice depends on an individual's anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  A rational response to economic incentives and disincentives means that an individual chooses the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  Option A: The waiter consciously decides to conceal a large part of his tip income to reduce his taxes because he believes that it is unlikely that he will be caught and penalized. This is a rational economic decision because he is weighing the cost and benefit of the action he takes.
  Option B: The motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license. This is a rational economic decision because she is weighing the cost and benefit of the action she takes.
  Option C: The industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. This is a rational economic decision because he is weighing the cost and benefit of the action he takes.
  Option D: The government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family. This is a rational economic decision because she is weighing the cost and benefit of the action she takes.
  Option E: The worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. This is not a rational economic decision because the worker is not weighing the cost and benefit of the action he takes.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle is used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle holds that individuals, given a choice of actions, will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives or disincentives would be the one that does not involve a person's decision to choose a course of action that maximizes their overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Choice E stands out as a crime of passion and does not involve a rational decision-making process based on economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  An action that maximizes utility is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  The waiter in choice A conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized, which maximizes his expected utility.
  The motorist in choice B avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license, which maximizes her expected utility.
  The industrialist in choice C continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant, which maximizes his expected utility.
  The government official in choice D risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family, which maximizes her expected utility.
  The worker in choice E physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, which is a result of an impulsive decision and not a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The explanation of the utility maximization principle suggests that a person commits a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The principle holds that given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  Therefore, a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives would be one that maximizes an individual's expected utility.
  A, B, C, and D could be considered rational responses to economic incentives or disincentives.
  However, E is an impulsive crime rather than a deliberate crime, therefore, it is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The four examples given in the answer choices are all examples of a response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  The option that is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one that does not maximize the individual's expected utility.
  Option A involves a waiter who conceals a large part of his tip income to reduce his taxes.
  This option represents a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option B involves a motorist who avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  This option represents a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option C involves an industrialist who continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  This option represents a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option D involves a government official in an impoverished country who risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  This option represents a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option E involves a worker who physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
  This option represents an impulsive response to a perceived injustice, and not a response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Therefore, option E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle holds that a rational individual will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Given this framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one that does not involve a rational economic choice.
  Option E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair, does not involve a rational economic choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals choose actions that maximize their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action and weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  Therefore, the person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Therefore, the answer should be the one in which the individual's decision does not maximize their anticipated overall satisfaction, given the constraints and incentives.
  Choice A describes a situation in which the waiter conceals his tip income to reduce his taxes because he believes that it is unlikely that he will be caught and penalized. This action maximizes his anticipated overall satisfaction; therefore, it is a rational response to economic incentives.
  Choice B describes a situation in which the motorist avoids speeding because she knows that it will lead to the loss of her driver's license. This action maximizes her anticipated overall satisfaction; therefore, it is a rational response to economic disincentives.
  Choice C describes a situation in which the industrialist continues to illegally discharge pollutant into the river because the cost of treatment is much higher than the fine for the illegal discharge. This action maximizes his anticipated overall satisfaction; therefore, it is a rational response to economic incentives.
  Choice D describes a situation in which the government official risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because of rampant inflation that has rendered her government salary inadequate to support herself and her family. This action maximizes her anticipated overall satisfaction; therefore, it is a rational response to economic incentives.
  Choice E describes a situation in which a worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace. This action does not maximize his anticipated overall satisfaction; therefore, it is not a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests that individuals will choose an action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by finding the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected utility.
  The question asks for the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  All the choices involve rational decisions by individuals to maximize their expected utility based on the economic incentives and disincentives.
  However, the least appropriate would be the one where the person is not responding to economic incentives or disincentives, but rather to personal motives or emotions.
  This makes choice E the least appropriate.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  All the choices are about the rational response of individuals to economic incentives and disincentives.
  The option that does not fit the description in the passage is the least appropriately described.
  Choice E describes an impulsive crime of passion, not a deliberate crime that is the focus of the passage.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle states that individuals make rational decisions based on maximizing their overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is determined by weighing the utilities of possible outcomes that are likely to happen.
  A person will commit a crime if the expected utility of doing so exceeds the expected utility of lawful activity.
  The question asks which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option A, B, C, and D all describe a rational decision based on economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option E involves an impulsive crime, which is not a rational decision based on economic incentives or disincentives.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job, and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
The question asks which choice, if true, would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power. The passage discusses how increasing returns lead to monopoly power, and how the invisible hand tends to work better in industries with many competitors. Therefore, the best answer would be a statement that shows that increasing returns do not necessarily lead to monopoly power or that many competitors can exist even in industries with increasing returns to scale.
A: This answer choice implies that there are businesses that exert monopoly power even when larger businesses exist in other regions. This does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, and it does not address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and monopoly power.
B: This answer choice describes a possible negative consequence of increased specialization but does not directly address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power or the assumptions behind the invisible hand.
C: This answer choice describes how businesses that dominate an industry may collude to set prices. This behavior is consistent with the idea that large firms can exert monopoly power, and it does not address the relationship between increasing returns to scale and the assumptions behind the invisible hand.
D: This answer choice implies that there is no fixed relationship between the size of a business and its ability to achieve increasing returns to scale. If this were true, it would suggest that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is not as strong as the passage suggests. Therefore, this is the correct answer.
E: This answer choice suggests that there are limits to the gains in productivity from increased specialization. However, it does not directly address the relationship between increased size and monopoly power or the assumptions behind the invisible hand.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, if there is evidence that increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power, this would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A suggests that there are instances where smaller businesses in one region are able to exert monopoly power, even as larger businesses coexist in other regions.
  This suggests that monopoly power is not just a function of size, and hence undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues that there is a natural tendency toward monopoly due to increasing returns to scale.
  The author also claims that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  Therefore, if a statement undermines this connection between increased size and monopoly power, it would cast doubt on the author's argument.
  Choice A discusses regional monopolies, but it does not address the relationship between size and monopoly power.
  Choice B discusses salary, which is not directly related to the argument.
  Choice C reinforces the tendency toward monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that increased size does not necessarily lead to increasing returns to scale, but it does not undermine the connection between size and monopoly power.
  Choice E suggests that further gains in productivity are not always possible and therefore does not address the argument. 
  Therefore, the best answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. This statement suggests that there are factors other than size that influence the presence of monopoly power, which undermines the author's argument. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopoly power and free markets can only work properly if there are many competitors in each industry.
  The author assumes that the size needed to achieve increasing returns to scale is similar across industries.
  The correct answer would weaken the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly and that the invisible hand works properly only if there are many competitors in each industry.
  The author uses the example of the pin factory, which emphasizes the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size.
  If increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power, then the author's argument is undermined.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  The author argues that free markets get it right if returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Therefore, any answer choice that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice A is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice B is also not relevant.
  Choice C actually supports the author's argument.
  Choice D does not necessarily undermine the author's argument, because it still implies that some industries are dominated by a few players due to increasing returns to scale.
  Choice E also does not necessarily undermine the author's argument, because there may be other factors that offset the gains in productivity from specialization.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices undermine the author's argument, but Choice C actually supports the author's argument.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author describes the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in economic theory.
  The parable of the pin factory describes how there are increasing returns to scale but increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  Any statement that challenges the assumption that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power would undermine the connection that the author draws.
  Choice C describes that businesses often collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly. This statement supports the idea that increasing returns lead to monopoly power.
  Choice B would not necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice D suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies by industry.
  Choice E describes some factors that can offset gains in productivity achieved by increased specialization.
  Choice A describes a scenario where businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  Choice A suggests that the relationship between size and monopoly power is not necessarily straightforward.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to drive smaller firms out of business, leading to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that no one can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, any statement that suggests that increasing returns do not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine the author's argument.
  Choice D suggests that the size required for increasing returns varies from industry to industry, which implies that increasing returns may not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking for an answer that would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  The passage explains that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business and natural tendency toward monopoly is created by increasing returns to scale.
  The passage also explains that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  A, B, C, and E choices do not provide any evidence against the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D provides evidence that the size required to achieve increasing returns to scale varies from industry to industry.
  If the size requirement varies, then not all industries will experience increasing returns to scale and the connection between increased size and monopoly power will weaken.
  Therefore, the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  To defend this claim, the author argues that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  The author also argues that there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, any answer that suggests that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power would undermine the argument.
  Choice A does not undermine the argument, as it suggests that some businesses are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region, which is consistent with the idea that a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  Choice B is unrelated to the argument.
  Choice C supports the argument that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  Choice D does not undermine the argument, as it does not suggest that increasing returns to scale do not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  Choice E also does not undermine the argument, as it suggests that any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This undermines the argument that increasing returns to scale necessarily lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Thought:
The author argues that biotechnology patents do not hinder basic research, but instead encourage innovation by providing economic rewards and licensing control. The author also argues that the fear that patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for research involving patented materials is misguided. Finally, the author argues that the noncommercial research exception to patent infringement is likely to be respected by judges.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses how some people fear that biotechnology patents will hinder basic research by restricting access to research materials. The author argues that these fears are unfounded because patents are unlikely to be enforced against researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research. The author also argues that patents actually provide incentives for innovation. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the choice that supports this argument.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author discusses the concerns surrounding patenting biological materials and the potential hindrance on basic research.
  The author argues that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access and that patents actually spur, rather than hinder, basic research.
  The author notes that patent litigation is expensive and generally only initiated to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The author argues that patents provide a compelling incentive to innovate since they bring economic rewards and licensing control over the use of discoveries. The author also points out that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access and that patents are not a hindrance to basic research. Moreover, judges have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author argues that researchers are increasingly convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential.
  Researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement or refusing to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken.
  The author thinks that these fears are unfounded and that patents will actually spur research rather than hinder it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author argues that some researchers fear patenting biological materials will restrict access to research materials.
  The author argues that patent rights do not imply the right to deny access.
  The author argues that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement C: "The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author discusses the benefits of patenting biotechnology for research industries.
  The author also acknowledges the concerns of researchers who oppose biotechnology patents and their fears of restricted access to research materials.
  The author argues that patenting biotechnology should not restrict researchers from conducting basic and noncommercial research, and that patents may actually incentivize innovation.
  Based on these points, the author would likely agree that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The author argues against the idea that biotechnology patents hinder basic research, and seems to believe that patents can actually spur innovation and provide incentives for scientists to innovate. They also argue that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access, and that judges have respected a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
Choice A is incorrect because the author does not mention entitlement to intellectual property protection as a reason for freely sharing research materials. Choice B is incorrect because while the author acknowledges concerns about prohibitively high fees, they does not suggest that this is typical behavior. Choice D is incorrect because the author does not express concern over the reliance on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of results. Choice E is incorrect because the author does not suggest that scientists who oppose patenting do so because their work is not innovative enough.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that patenting biotechnology spurs innovation.
  The author also argues that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents are misunderstanding the nature of patent rights.
  The author suggests that enforcing a biotechnology patent against a researcher engaged in basic and noncommercial research is unlikely due to the noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  The author argues that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement in choice C that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The author argues that patents do not hinder basic research, but rather incentivize innovation.
The author also mentions that judges respect a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
The author argues that some biotechnology researchers have come to share the view that intellectual property protection is necessary.
The author also recognizes that some researchers fear that patent holders may prevent access to research materials.
The author argues that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents may confuse patent rights with control of access to biological materials.
The author also mentions that patents provide scientists with a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries, which can be an incentive for innovation.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes auxiliary premises that appeal to theories or correct functioning of instrumentation or to the absence of disturbing forces which could lead to false predictions.
  Passage B describes how astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. They changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets to explain the incorrect predictions and later found the predicted planet.
  Disturbing forces cause incorrect predictions; auxiliary assumptions can be used to explain the incorrect predictions. 
  Therefore, the answer to the question is the word or phrase that describes a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks about a concept introduced in passage A.
  In passage A, the author talks about auxiliary premises that are necessary for the theory to derive its predictions.
  In passage B, astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets when they found that the predicted orbit for Uranus was incorrect.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Mercury, which they called Vulcan.
  Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  In passage A (line 26), the disturbing force is one of the auxiliary premises that scientists need to consider in order to derive theories' predictions.
  In passage B, the auxiliary assumptions include the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  One auxiliary assumption was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. But the astronomers changed this assumption, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the disturbing force that caused the failure of the prediction for Uranus's orbit was the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
Action: Answer("C") 
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question refers to an idea introduced in passage A (line 26), which talks about "additional 'auxiliary' premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc." 
  The passage B discusses how astronomers, using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, made predictions about the orbit of Mercury. 
  The passage mentions that the predictions failed, and the astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. 
  However, Vulcan was never found. 
  Therefore, something must have been disturbing the orbit of Mercury, which they attributed to Vulcan. 
  The answer should be the planet or object that was disturbing the orbit of Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In passage A, Popper refers to a number of "auxiliary" premises that are introduced to support a theory's predictions, which can sometimes be the cause of an experiment's failure to work out as predicted.
  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary premises, one of which was the belief that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The discrepancy between the predicted and observed orbit of Uranus led the astronomers to change their auxiliary premises about the existence of other planets.
  Therefore, the answer to this question should be either Uranus or the belief that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus, as this premise was revised by the astronomers.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage explains how scientists predicted the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  The predictions were wrong and scientists hypothesized that there were other planets in the vicinity that influenced the observed orbit.
  The hypothesis of these planets was based on auxiliary assumptions.
  The passage does not explain any disturbing force.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  In Passage A, "disturbing forces" are mentioned in the context of "auxiliary premises" that scientists use to derive a theory's predictions. 
  In Passage B, auxiliary assumptions are also mentioned. 
  One of the auxiliary assumptions about Uranus was that no planets existed in its vicinity. 
  The failure of the prediction of Uranus's orbit could be due to an error in this auxiliary assumption about the existence of other planets. 
  This error in an auxiliary assumption is an example of a "disturbing force".
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neptune.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question refers to "disturbing force," as described in passage A (line 26).
  In passage A (line 26), "disturbing force" was used to describe one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists often need to derive a theory's predictions.
  In passage B, auxiliary assumptions were used to predict the orbit of Uranus and Mercury.
  The question is asking which of the following in passage B most clearly illustrates a "disturbing force."
  Uranus (A) and Neptune (C) were planets that the astronomers used to make their predictions and observations; they were not considered auxiliary assumptions. The same goes for the sun (B) and the moon (E).
  Mercury (D) was used to make predictions based on Newton's laws, but the predictions were not borne out until general relativity was introduced. This means that the auxiliary assumption(s) used to derive Mercury's predictions was/were incorrect.
  Therefore, the hypothesis of Vulcan's existence was used to search for a "disturbing force" that could explain the discrepancy, but it was never found.
  The answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks for an example of a disturbing force, as described in passage A.
  According to passage A, auxiliary premises or assumptions can be disturbing forces when they affect the prediction of a theory.
  In passage B, the astronomers made an assumption that no planet exists in the vicinity of Uranus when they predicted Uranus's orbit. 
  Later, they found that there must be another planet in the vicinity to produce the observed orbit, which means the assumption the astronomers made was a disturbing force.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uranus.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
In Passage A, the author mentions "auxiliary premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc." (line 27-29) as part of the premises for deriving a theory's predictions.
In Passage B, the astronomers based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about several planets' masses, orbits, and velocities. 
When the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect, one possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. But the astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. They later discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
Therefore, Neptune is the answer that illustrates a "disturbing force" that caused the prediction of Uranus's orbit to fail and showed an error in the auxiliary assumptions.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: It can most reasonably be inferred that the aulbor would agree wilb which one oflbe following statements?
Choices:
  A: Those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model ofpub1ishing will be uuiikely to remain economically competitive.

  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.
  Therefore, it can most reasonably be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that those publishers that fail to embrace the new digital model of publishing will be unlikely to remain economically competitive.

Thought:
  The author argues that digital publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers.
  The elimination of whole categories of expense, such as printing and distributing physical books, means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product.
  Therefore, under the digital publishing model, literary agents marketing new manuscripts could expect a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional.
  The author also states that large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede.
  Therefore, the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure.
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.

  Choice D is not supported by the passage, which does not provide information on the number of copies that digital books will sell compared to traditional books. 
  Choice E is not consistent with the author's argument, which suggests that the elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

  According to Dostoevsky, reality was the crucial source of literature.
  He believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case

  The same principle is used by legal scholars to determine the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  According to the utility maximization principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The two methods of deterrence, increasing penalties and strengthening law enforcement, and increasing economic opportunities of the most economically alienated individuals, affect the utility equation.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought:
The question asks how physicists could have more quickly realized that atoms were being split.
The passage describes how physicists conducted experiments and observed by-products without realizing that they were witnessing nuclear fission.
The passage also mentions that theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart before the experimental discovery of nuclear fission.
Therefore, knowledge of theoretical principles could have helped physicists to recognize nuclear fission earlier.
Choice A, B, and D are not related to the theoretical principles.
Choice E talks about experiments on a different substance than uranium.
Choice C says the physicists had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
If physicists had been aware of these calculations, they could have recognized nuclear fission earlier.
Therefore, Choice C is the best answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The physicists compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Coining the term "nuclear fission," Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if at the time physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms or had not had narrow expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products it would have been easier and quicker to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that physicists were compiling evidence of nuclear fission without realizing they were witnessing it.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data.
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize atoms were being split, there must have been a quicker recognition of the significance of the data.
  Therefore, the correct choice must explain what could have accelerated the process of recognizing the significance of the data.
  Choice A does not relate to the recognition of the significance of the data.
  Choice B contradicts what the passage said about researchers' expectations for the by-products.
  Choice C also contradicts what the passage stated about theoretical physicists' calculations.
  Choice D might have helped, but it does not provide a direct answer to reduce the amount of time taken.
  Therefore, choice E is the most likely answer, as the experimentation of other substances might have led to quicker recognition of the significance of the data.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage states that researchers compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved without recognizing it.
  The researchers were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in that context.
  Researchers were hindered by the expectation that the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Meitner undertook related research in Sweden and recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if researchers were not hindered by the expectation that the radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition, then they would have been more likely to recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and realize that atoms were being split in a shorter amount of time.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The researchers did not even recognize the possibility of nuclear fission happening in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, this would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split because they would not have been limited by their expectations.
  The answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  However, researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in the context of neutron-bombardment experiments.
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been aware of the calculations indicating the possibility of breaking atoms apart, they might have recognized what they were witnessing earlier.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains that the physicists conducting the experiments did not recognize what was happening, despite the increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The passage also explains that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The passage suggests that the researchers' expectation of what the by-products would be made it more difficult to identify and understand the significance of the experimental results.
  Therefore, to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, it would have been most helpful if the physicists did not have prior expectations about the by-products and were more knowledgeable about the theoretical calculations.
  Choice B correctly reflects this idea.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that, historically, physicists did not immediately realize they had split the atom.
  The passage offers a few reasons for this delay in recognition.
  The question asks which one of the options would MOST LIKELY have reduced the amount of time it took physicists to realize they had split the atom.
  Option E is unlikely to have impacted the recognition of uranium atom splitting.
  Option C does not seem like a major contributing factor, since the possibility of atom splitting was being discussed by theoretical physicists.
  Option A does not seem particularly relevant to the delay in recognizing atom splitting.
  Option B is a viable contender. It is suggested in the passage that the researchers' expectations regarding the uranium by-products hindered their recognition of fission. If this expectation had not been present, the researchers may have recognized fission sooner. 
  Option D is not discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage indicates that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were not receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might occur during the experiments. Therefore, any option that would have made the researchers more receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission would have made it more likely that they would have realized that atoms were being split. Options A and D do not address the researchers' lack of receptivity, so they can be eliminated. Option E is irrelevant because it refers to experiments conducted on substances other than uranium. Option B contradicts the passage, which states that researchers expected the products of neutron bombardment to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. Therefore, the only option that remains is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms. If the researchers had been aware of the theoretical possibility of splitting atoms, they might have been more receptive to the idea that it was happening during their experiments.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the scientists did not recognize what they were witnessing when they compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The passage also states that theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, but the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Therefore, if the physicists had been aware of the theoretical physicists' calculations and had aimed their neutron-bombardment experiments at achieving the result, it would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  The answer is C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks for an assertion from passage A that exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  In passage B, the author criticizes evolutionary psychology for imputing an interest to the agent of the behavior that is not acknowledged and may not even be aware of.
  The author of passage B thinks that this kind of inference is vanishingly rare because there are usually multiple interests that would explain any given behavior.
  Therefore, the assertion from passage A that exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is the one in which evolutionary psychologists argue that "genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish."
Action: Answer("D")

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 0.8 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought: 
  "Bicultural" implies the involvement of two cultures.
  "Composite" refers to something that is made up of multiple parts.
  "Authorship" refers to the act of writing or being an author.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" most likely refers to the act of writing a text that involves the collaboration of individuals from two different cultures, where each individual contributes to the finished product.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  "Bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of life history.
  Scholars have focused on the "as-told-to" life histories of Native Americans.
  These life histories are solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  These life histories emerged from bicultural composite authorship.
  "Bicultural" suggests two cultures are involved.
  "Composite authorship" suggests that multiple people are involved in creating the life history.
  Combining these ideas, "bicultural composite authorship" can be inferred as a life history that emerged from the collaboration of individuals from two different cultures.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe a specific type of life history.
  This type of life history is written by non-Native American collaborators.
  The collaborators solicit, translate, record, and edit the life history.
  The life history is based on oral communication with Native American individuals.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a life history written by non-Native American collaborators based on oral communication with Native American individuals.
  The answer is E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe the way the autobiographies of Native Americans were produced.
The phrase is introduced in contrast to "traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history".
The phrase suggests that the autobiographical texts were produced by Native Americans in collaboration with non-Native American collaborators.
The phrase implies that the texts are a hybrid produced by two cultures.
The best answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of life history.
It was "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
The life histories emerged from bicultural composite authorship.
Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between a non-Native American and a Native American in creating a life history.
Option B mentions two people from different cultures contributing to the finished product in the same way, but the passage suggests that the non-Native American collaborators in bicultural composite authorship played different roles such as soliciting, translating, recording, and editing.
Option D mentions editing and revising by a member of another culture, which is accurate. 
However, Option A is more concise and provides a more comprehensive explanation of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is used in reference to the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  Scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  This implies that the autobiographies are the result of collaboration between two cultures.
  The term "composite" implies that the final product is a mixture of two or more elements.
  The "bicultural" nature of the authorship suggests that the collaboration is between two different cultures.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the fact that the autobiographies are the result of collaboration between Native American and non-Native American cultures.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is described as an approach to creating Native American autobiographies. 
  The phrase suggests that the autobiographies are the result of collaboration between Native American authors and non-Native American collaborators.
  The phrase "composite" suggests that the final product is a combination of different elements, likely oral and written.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that the Native American autobiographies were produced through collaboration between Native American authors and non-Native American collaborators where the final product is a combination of different elements.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage explains that scholars have focused on written documents of Native Americans created with the assistance of non-Native American collaborators. This process is described as "bicultural composite authorship." 
The scholars' focus is on the written documents that emerged from this process, which means it can be concluded that the written documents are works created by both a Native American and a non-Native American. 
Therefore, Option B, "written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product," most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage states that the autobiographies of Native Americans were created through "bicultural composite authorship".
  The passage explains that these life histories were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  This means that "bicultural composite authorship" refers to non-Native American people collaborating with Native Americans to create written autobiographies.
  Choice A is incorrect because it refers to artifacts and oral traditions.
  Choice B is incorrect because the passage only refers to non-Native American people collaborating with Native Americans, not two people from different cultures contributing equally.
  Choice C is incorrect because the passage clearly states that the identities of the collaborators can be determined.
  Choice D is incorrect because it only describes the editing process, but not the creation process.
  Choice E is incorrect because it refers to a member of one culture creating an autobiography based on oral communication from a member of another culture, but the passage clearly states that the written autobiographies were created through collaboration.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is defined by its context.
It is said to refer to "as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
The phrase suggests that the resulting written document is a collaboration between people from different cultures. 
Among these collaborators, some are Native Americans, and others are not.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.
Response 0:
Thought:

  The passage explains that researchers who conduct basic, noncommercial research are usually given an exception to patent infringement.
  Patent litigation is expensive and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  It is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Based on the information given, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research using patented materials.
  The author argues against this notion by saying that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  The author further argues that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  It is likely that the researcher will not be held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and the patent holder initiates a legal action, particularly when the research is noncommercial.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author argues that academic researchers and for-profit corporations have a shared interest in allowing intellectual property protection for commercial potential discoveries.
  However, academic researchers fear that their access to research materials might be restricted either through patents or contractual agreements.
  The author argues that there is a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement that judges usually respect.
  The author also argues that patents spurs innovation and rewards scientists economically.
  Therefore, the author would most likely predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 0.8 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.

The author discusses the modular theory of mind and how it may not be valid.
The author explains that the FMRI actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use.
The entire brain is active in both control and cognitive task conditions.
The subtractive method does not represent the whole picture of cognitive tasks.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author criticizes the modular theory of mind for assuming that mental activity can be separated into independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The author argues that mental activity may not be decomposable into independent modules and that various mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity.
  Brain scans, such as FMRI, reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  FMRI measures the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which is a measure of metabolic activity.
  The subtractive method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with a particular cognitive task.
  The entire brain is active in both control and on-task measurements, but the subtractive method obscures this fact.
  The modular theory of mind is attractive because it is illustrated well by the products of the subtractive method.
  
  The passage most strongly supports choice C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses the use of brain scans and their relationship to the modular theory of mind. The passage explains the subtractive method of measuring metabolic activity, where baseline measurements are compared with measurements taken when performing a cognitive task. 
Choice A is contradicted because the passage argues that the mind may not be decomposable into independent modules. 
Choice B is also contradicted because the passage does not suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero. 
Choice D is not mentioned in the passage.
Choice E is not a general statement supported by the passage. 
Choice C is the best answer because the passage explains that during certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology research.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The validity of the modular theory of mind is challenged by the claim that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage discusses the subtractive method as a way of interpreting brain scans.
  The subtractive method functions by subtracting a baseline measurement of metabolic activity from on-task measurement.
  The reasoning behind this approach is that what remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity solely associated with the cognitive task in question.
  While this method produces striking images of the brain at work, it may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Based on the passage, the most strongly supported statement is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses some of the conceptual problems with the use of brain scans as a way to understand mental activity in psychology. 
The author argues against the modular theory of mind, which suggests that different mental processes are located in separate and distinct modules in the brain. 
The author also explains how the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
The passage suggests that the entire brain is active in both control and cognitive task conditions.
Action: Answer("C") 
Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is that, during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage describes how the validity of using brain scans to identify mental activity depends on the modular theory of mind, but this theory is challenged by psychologist William Uttal. Brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" due to different cognitive tasks, but this image is the result of a subtraction method that obscures the fact that the whole brain is active in both conditions. The subtractive method gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
A: The passage does not support the idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. In fact, it challenges this idea by suggesting that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
B: The passage does not discuss whether regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. This statement is not supported by the passage.
C: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage describes how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
D: The passage describes how a baseline measurement is taken in the control condition and subtracted from the on-task measurement to produce a differential brain scan that shows the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The passage does not suggest that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. This statement is not supported by the passage.
E: The passage describes how the modular theory of mind is challenged by the fact that emotion and reason-giving are not cleanly separated in the brain. The passage also describes how the subtractive method used in FMRI produces a false impression of neat functional localization. The passage does not specifically mention anger or any other specific emotion. This statement is not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The passage notes that the modular theory of mind may not be valid and that the subtractive method used in brain scans is problematic in that it obscures the fact that the whole brain is active in both conditions. Additionally, the passage notes that the FMRI measures metabolic activity in the brain. 
Choice A: The passage notes that the validity of the modular theory of mind is questionable and makes reference to the fact that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. 
Choice B: The passage does not suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have an oxygen use rate close to zero. 
Choice C: The passage notes that the brain areas that are most metabolically active during certain cognitive tasks show a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain. 
Choice D: The passage does not support this statement, which contradicts the fact that the subtractive method is used to measure differential (not absolute) rates of oxygen use for a specific cognitive task. 
Choice E: The passage does not mention this specific example of anger in relation to the subtractive method. 
The best answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage discusses the use of brain scans and the modular theory of mind.
The modular theory of mind is criticized as it is difficult to separate emotions and reason-giving.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) uses a subtractive method to produce striking images of the brain at work.
The entire brain is active in both conditions, and this method obscures distributed brain functions.
The FMRI shows the differential rate of oxygen use - the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and how the use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity relates to it. The passage highlights the flaws of the modular theory of mind, stating that mental activity or the physical processes that constitute it may not be decomposable into independent modules. Instead of distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what one sees when looking at a brain scan is a result of a subtraction. The FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, making it difficult to separate cognitive tasks from other brain functions. Therefore, the answer should be the one that best describes the relationship between brain scans and cognitive tasks.
Action: Answer("C")  
The statement "During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain" is the most strongly supported by the passage.
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage explains how the modular theory of mind is flawed in its premise that there are independent modules of the mind located in specific regions of the brain. The passage also explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works by subtracting baseline measurements from the on-task measurements. The subtractive method produces images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
Choice A: The passage doesn't support this statement. It states that the modular theory of mind may not be valid, and mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.

Choice B: The passage doesn't support this statement. It explains that the FMRI technique does not measure the absolute rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but instead measures the differential rate of oxygen use between a baseline measurement and the on-task measurement.

Choice C: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage explains that FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. During certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than the rest of the brain.

Choice D: The passage explains that the subtractive method of FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions. It doesn't provide evidence that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Therefore, this statement is not supported by the passage.

Choice E: The passage doesn't support this statement. It doesn't provide any information on how brain scans show metabolic activity when a brain scan subject experiences anger.

The best answer choice is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match

Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that our behavior is determined by the operations of our brain, whether or not we are consciously aware of it.
  Hence, it suggests that we may not have free choice as we believe.
  Passage A argues that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism.
  It argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world as long as their actions are not constrained.
  Passage B suggests that actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained and are therefore free.
  Mental disorders are mentioned in Passage B, but only as an example of constrained actions.
  Passage A discusses self-delusion in regard to free and rational moral choice.
  Causality is a key concept in both passages.
  Moral responsibility is mentioned in Passage A, but only in reference to the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that recent findings in neuroscience suggest that the criminal justice system should focus on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  The viewpoint in Passage A considers that people may be deluding themselves when they believe they are making a free and rational moral choice.
  Passage B argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world, and distinguishes free actions from constrained actions.
  Passage B considers that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, meaning that those actions that originate from a disease-free brain are free, even though they may be determined.
  The concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A is free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A states that the viewpoint of neuroscientists changes the way we think about law, suggesting that punishment should be focused on deterring future harms instead of retribution.
  Passage A argues that the notion of free and rational moral choices may be a delusion because a brain scan may show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, where free actions are those caused by internal sources, by one's own will, and constrained actions are those caused by external sources.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and it is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free.
  Mental disorder and self-delusion are mentioned in passage A, but not in passage B.
  Causality plays a role in both passages, as both argue that behavior is caused by the brain and that a person's actions are determined by internal or external sources.
  Free choice is a concept that is discussed in both passages, but in different ways.
  Passage A argues that the notion of free and rational moral choices may be a delusion because a brain scan may show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and it is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free.

  Mental disorder and self-delusion concepts are mentioned in passage A but not in passage B.
  Free choice and causality concepts are mentioned in both passages.
  Moral responsibility is not discussed in passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is E: moral responsibility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that a person's behavior is caused solely by the operations of their brain.
  This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing bad people because of their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that a person can still act freely even in a deterministic world.
  Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions and argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice, which is discussed in Passage B but not in Passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscientific findings suggest that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution.
  Instead, the focus should be on deterring future harms, and lighter punishment may be appropriate in some cases.
  Passage A argues against the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are caused by one's own will and not by an external source.
  This concept of free actions plays a role in the argument of passage B but does not play a role in the argument of passage A.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch.

Response 1:
Thought:
The author refers to "the relevant evidence" as something that had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
The author explains that the relevant evidence was only recognized after Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection.
The crucial theoretical connection was the realization that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
The evidence that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms was based on the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Therefore, the most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" is the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence is what became clear when scientists rushed to corroborate the findings.
  The findings were that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence must be in relation to the fact that uranium atoms were being split.
  The answer must be a statement that provides evidence of uranium atoms being split.
  The only statement that does so is "the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939".
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.

  The passage goes on to describe how Meitner made this conceptual link and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  The passage mentions that Hahn's discovery provided the "clear chemical evidence" that assisted Meitner in her conclusion.
  Therefore, the "relevant evidence" most nearly equivalent to the clear chemical evidence of barium's production provided by Hahn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The "relevant evidence" referred to in line 62 is presented in the text as the key element that was required by scientists to realize that they had been splitting uranium atoms.
The discovery was made after a series of neutron-bombardment experiments conducted in the late 1930s.
It was the identification of barium in one of the substances produced by neutron bombardment that signaled the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author uses the phrase 'the relevant evidence' to refer to the evidence that had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The discovery of nuclear fission by scientists was due to the experimental results in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The identification of barium as one of the products resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium was surprising, but its importance was not recognized until Meitner made the theoretical connection.
  Therefore, the author means A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question refers to the "relevant evidence" mentioned in the passage.
  The relevant evidence refers to the evidence that supported the conclusion that researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who merged a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  The author also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as displaying an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
  The question is asking which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a merger between a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, which generated a complex result.
  The passage notes that Lichtenstein's images were fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  The passage also describes Lichtenstein's work as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
  The passage emphasizes that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them an inner sweetness.
  Therefore, if Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist or criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional or void-of-emotion paintings, it would not necessarily challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  The only statement that would challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein is if Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, which would go against his rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who, through his work, managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody, displayed an impulse toward realism and a kind of deliberate naivete intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists.
  The question asks which one of the following options, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Therefore, the correct answer would be an option that contradicts the above characterization.
  Option A talks about Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, which does not necessarily contradict the characterization.
  Option B talks about Lichtenstein praising an abstract expressionist painter, which also does not necessarily contradict the characterization.
  Option C talks about Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, which seems to go against the characterization of Lichtenstein, however, it does not challenge it directly.
  Option D talks about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings, which also does not necessarily contradict the characterization.
  Option E talks about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, which goes against the characterization of Lichtenstein and would challenge the author's characterization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex combination of parody and realism that conveys a seriousness of theme.
  The author demonstrates that Lichtenstein's work was a response to the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists and later abstract expressionists.
  If Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters and praised their emotional paintings, it would contradict the author's characterization that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as a pop artist who used comic book style to convey a realism of contemporary life and a sense of nostalgia, with an inner sweetness.
  The passage also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, with an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  To challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, the new information should contradict the notion that Lichtenstein's work conveyed a realism of contemporary life or a sense of nostalgia.
  A, B, and D have nothing to do with the characterization of Lichtenstein in the passage.
  C contradicts the idea that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, which is a crucial part of the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  E contradicts the idea that Lichtenstein's work was void of emotion, which is not a part of the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that Lichtenstein was part of a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  The passage also suggests that Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism.
  Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete.
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's persistent use of comic-art conventions and his faith in reconciliation.
  Therefore, if Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting or criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it would go against the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as a pop artist who merged popular genres into fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended mere parody. 
  The passage also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  The correct answer would be the one that challenges the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as a pop artist who merged popular genres into fine art and conveyed a seriousness of theme that transcended mere parody.
  Choice (A) does not challenge the characterization, since attending exhibitions does not necessarily indicate agreement or praise.
  Choice (B) also does not challenge the characterization, since Lichtenstein praising an abstract expressionist for producing an emotional painting does not necessarily contradict his own work.
  Choice (C) does not challenge the characterization, since Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict his own work.
  Choice (D) does not challenge the characterization, since Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist for producing emotional paintings does not necessarily contradict his own work.
  Choice (E) challenges the characterization, since Lichtenstein's work is characterized as conveying a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody, and his work is also characterized as displaying an impulse toward realism and depicting contemporary life.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as someone who used the style of comic books to generate a complex result, poking fun at the pretensions of the art world while conveying a seriousness of theme.
  The author also characterizes Lichtenstein's work as reflecting a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication.
  To challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, we need to find a choice that contradicts or undermines the author's description of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice A simply states that Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s, which does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice B suggests that Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting, which also does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice C suggests that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, which is also not contradictory to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice D suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, which is irrelevant to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice E suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, which could potentially contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work, since the author describes Lichtenstein's work as conveying a seriousness of theme and displaying an impulse toward realism.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art that generated a complex result.
  The author also notes that Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and that his work displayed an impulse toward realism to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life.
  Based on this, if Lichtenstein praised the emotional or atypically emotional work of an abstract expressionist, it would challenge the author's characterization of his work as part of a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who helped define Pop art by merging a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art, while also displaying an impulse toward realism and an urge to depict contemporary life. Furthermore, it suggests that Lichtenstein's work exuded a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists. 
  Answers A, B, and C do not challenge any of the aforementioned characterizations. Answer D seems unlikely since the passage does not suggest that Lichtenstein criticized any pop artist for producing emotional paintings. On the other hand, answer E appears to challenge the passage's characterization of Lichtenstein as having deliberately created a naive style as a response to the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists, and suggests that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing emotionless paintings instead.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 0.8 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues that it is not a crime to profit from knowledge that is not shared by everyone.
  However, insider trading law makes it illegal to profit from information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is one that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading can be beneficial and that it spreads knowledge about changes in circumstances.
  The author of passage B believes that insider trading is unfair and compromises the transparency of the stock market.
  The law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would permit some types of insider trading but prohibit others.
  Answer choice B prohibits insider trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, but permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law makes it a crime to make transactions based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  The author of Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible.
  The author of Passage A suggests that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value can help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that in an insider-trading situation, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. This unfairly compromises the market and causes a loss of investor confidence.
  The author of Passage B argues that people invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money, and undermining investor confidence would deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful.
  Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A thinks that insider trading could be beneficial for the stock market if the information is spread quickly so that stock prices reflect all the available information.
  The author of passage B thinks that insider trading undermines the market by giving some investors an unfair advantage over others, which could lead to a loss of investor confidence and ultimately destroy the market.
  Of the choices given, choice B prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the position articulated by the author of Passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A supports the idea that accurate information should be spread as widely and quickly as possible to ensure stock prices reflect an accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  The passage also highlights that insider trading is not the same as analyzing a stock and making a decision based on one's evaluation of its value.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market and how insider trading can compromise it.
  The author of Passage A argues that insider nontrading is also a widespread practice and should not be punished, whereas Passage B does not address it.
  Based on these, answer choice B seems to be the one that aligns with the position articulated in Passage A.
  Answer choice A prohibits all trading based on non-shared information, while Passage A argues that spreading accurate information quickly is beneficial.
  Answer choice C prohibits trading that undermines investor confidence, but neither passage argues for or against this as a solution to insider trading.
  Answer choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price should be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, while Passage A does not make this distinction.
  Answer choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not the position articulated in either passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author of passage A is in favor of allowing insider trading with conditions.
  The author of passage B is against allowing insider trading because it undermines the transparency of the market.
  Passage A argues that the spread of information about a company is essential for the stock market, and insider trading can help to spread such knowledge.
  Passage B claims that insider trading provides an unfair advantage to some people who have access to inside information that others do not have.
  A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading is necessary for a functioning stock market, but insider nontrading is also important.
  The author argues that accurate information about a company should be spread as widely as possible to ensure stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  The author argues that someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping.
  Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the market and unfairly gives some people an advantage over others.
  The author argues that in a transparent market, everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill.
  The author argues that insider trading causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
  Based on these arguments, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that there is a difference between making trades using non-public information obtained through one's position within a company and using publicly available information.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading is unfair because it gives some traders an unfair advantage and undermines investor confidence in the market.
  The question is asking for a law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B
  Choice B is the closest to the argument in passage A.
  Choice A would not allow any analysis of stocks that isn't shared by everyone, which is not the argument made in Passage A.
  Choice C is closer to the argument made in passage B than in passage A.
  Choice D is too specific, and does not adequately capture the position in passage A.
  Choice E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is not the argument made in Passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading law should allow trading based on information that is not shared by everyone.
  Passage A also argues that stock prices should reflect accurate assessments of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading law should prohibit trading based on information that other people don't have.
  Passage B also argues that insider trading undermines the principle of transparency in the stock market, and that investor confidence is essential for the stock market's success.
  Therefore, the law that best conforms to the position articulated in passage A but not in passage B is likely a law that allows trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible, including accurate information about changing circumstances.
  It also argues that allowing people with accurate information to act helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations undermine the transparency of the market and compromise it by giving people with inside information an unfair advantage over those who do not, ultimately leading to loss of investor confidence and could destroy the market.
  Passage A is in favor of allowing people with accurate information to act, while passage B argues against insider-trading situations, so the answer should be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents the harnessing of self-interest to the common good.
  The two concepts are opposed to each other, as increasing returns create a tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  The assumption that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption of diminishing returns, not increasing returns.
  Many economists tried and failed to bring the Pin Factory into mainstream economic thought until recent developments in mathematics.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is about the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than before.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand relies on diminishing returns to function properly. For almost two centuries, economists followed the diminishing returns assumption because it was easier to represent mathematically, and the Pin Factory was not formally recognized until recent times. The passage describes the development of economic thought in terms of these two concepts and how they relate to mathematical rigor.
Actions: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage discusses the tension between Adam Smith's concept of the Invisible Hand and the Pin Factory's increasing returns to scale. The mainstream economists previously had difficulty incorporating the Pin Factory concept into their theories due to lack of mathematical rigor. However, in recent years, they have found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the needed mathematical rigor. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand oppose each other because the Pin Factory suggests that returns to scale are increasing, leading to monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry to prevent monopoly. Economists failed to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought because it was hard to represent mathematically until the late 1970s, when economists found ways to describe it more rigorously. 
  The main point of the passage is that increasing returns to scale, although common in many industries, have been ignored by economists for a long time due to the difficulty of modeling them mathematically. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory refers to increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand refers to harnessing self-interest for the common good.
  The two concepts oppose each other because increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors.
  For a long time, economists struggled to describe increasing returns mathematically, preferring to rely on the diminishing returns assumption.
  Only recently have economists found ways to describe increasing returns with rigor, bringing this concept into the mainstream of economic thought.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have traditionally struggled with describing increasing returns and reconciling this concept with the Invisible Hand.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes a contradiction inherent in economic theory.
  The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts are opposed to each other.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes increasing returns to scale, which leads to natural monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand relies on diminishing returns to work properly, which supports many competitors in each industry.
  For centuries, economics assumed diminishing returns and ignored the Pin Factory.
  Only since the late 1970s has the underground river of increasing returns been acknowledged.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that economists have only recently accounted for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the efficiency of larger scale operations, which lead to increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand, on the other hand, requires many competitors to work properly, which implies diminishing returns to scale.
  Most economists have historically focused on diminishing returns because they are easier to represent mathematically.
  However, recent developments have allowed for increasing returns to be modeled more rigorously.
  Therefore, the main point is that the importance of increasing returns to scale in many industries has been overlooked, but recent developments in mathematics have led to a re-evaluation of their importance in economic theory.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts.
  The Pin Factory describes increasing returns to scale that lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The Invisible Hand describes how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention."
  For the Invisible Hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
  The passage presents a historical perspective on the development of economic theory.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two concepts from economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents the idea of increasing returns as businesses grow larger and more specialized.
  The Invisible Hand represents the idea that self-interest can lead to the common good in a market economy.
  These two concepts are opposed because increasing returns lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand needs many competitors in the market.
  The mainstream of economic thought has long assumed diminishing returns, as modeling increasing returns is difficult.
  Recent developments in mathematics have enabled economists to model the Pin Factory and account for increasing returns.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that increasing returns were once ignored in economic theory but have since been recognized as a key factor in several important industries.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help to ensure that stock prices reflect an accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading gives some people an unfair advantage over others and undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree with the argument in Passage B that insider-trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
- Passage A argues that insider trading can be beneficial for the stock market, as it helps spread accurate information and leads to more accurate stock prices.
- Passage B argues that insider trading undermines investor confidence and can ultimately destroy the market.
- The authors of each passage have different opinions on the issue, so they would not agree on all of the statements.
- The authors of Passage A would agree with the statement that it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis.
- The authors of Passage B would agree with the statement that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
- Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The authors in Passage A argue that insider-trading law should be reconsidered because it is based on the false premise that all information is available to all market participants at the same time. They suggest that stock markets work best when accurate information about changing circumstances is permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. They also argue that insider-nontrading is a far more widespread practice than insider trading and that no one would think to lock someone up for it. On the other hand, the authors in Passage B assert that the basic principles of the stock market are transparency and fairness. They argue that insider trading unfairly compromises the market because it allows some people to make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. They suggest that transparency is essential for investor confidence and that undermining it could ultimately destroy the market. 
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely as possible and that selling a stock based on insider knowledge about negative events is beneficial.
  Passage B claims that insider trading unfairly compromises the stock market by allowing some investors to make investing decisions based on information that others don't have.
  The authors of both passages appear to agree that transparency in the stock market is essential.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree with answer A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the principle of insider-trading law, which prohibits the use of non-public information for stock trading by people in a special position, is at odds with the transparency value of the stock market. It also argues that insider nontrading, which involves abstaining from trading despite having inside information, is equally prevalent but not subject to regulation. 
  Passage B contends that transparency is fundamental to the stock market, and that insider trading threatens to undermine investor confidence, which is essential to the market's success. 
  Therefore, the authors of both passages are likely to agree that transparency is a crucial aspect of the stock market, and that insider trading is problematic because it gives some investors an unfair advantage over others and could erode investor confidence, with negative consequences for the market's overall health.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A argue that stock markets work best when all relevant information is spread as widely and quickly as possible.
  They argue that insider trading based on information that is not available to the general public helps spread knowledge that the price ought to be dropping, which in turn helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all relevant facts.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that transparency is one of the basic principles of the stock market. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  It argues that insider trading gives some people an unfair advantage, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately destroy the market.
  Based on the passages, the authors would most likely agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. 
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that insider-trading law should be reconsidered because it interferes with the efficient operation of the stock market and undermines the dissemination of relevant information.
  Passage B suggests that transparency is a fundamental principle of the stock market and that insider trading undermines investor confidence, which could ultimately harm the entire market.
  Therefore, both authors are likely to agree that insider trading undermines investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that accurate information should be disseminated quickly and widely.
  Passage A argues that insider trading can help spread accurate information, but insider trading should be regulated.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the stock market by giving some people an unfair advantage and undermining investor confidence.
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that transparency is key to a fair stock market. 
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that:

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

  Sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze art that was produced by the second way because it embodied the ideology of the elite.
  But it also implies that the aristocracy and middle class may not produce an enduring art.
  The art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly.
  If some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic had to engage in an analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.

Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

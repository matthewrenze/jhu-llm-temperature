Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the phenomenon of wanting to make more money than one's neighbors.
  Passage A uses the term "rivalry" to describe the phenomenon.
  Passage B argues that people who want to earn more money do so because they want to create value and feel successful.
  Neither passage provides a clear indication of how the authors would describe a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors.
  However, passage B argues that wanting to create value benefits society, suggesting that the authors would not view such a person in a negative light.
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B both discuss the phenomenon of people wanting to have more money than their neighbors, or the importance of relative prosperity.
  Passage A refers to it as "rivalry" and describes it as a phenomenon of people comparing themselves with their "reference group" and finding happiness in a relative position improvement.
  Passage B refers to it as a desire to create value, where people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Neither passage describes the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors with negative terms, such as insular, miserable, misguided, or primitive.
  Passage B explains that this desire is not necessarily egocentric, but rather evidence of a desire to create value and benefits society.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A states that people are happy only when their relative position improves.
  Passage B explains that people derive happiness from creating value.
  The authors of both passages do not view wanting to make more money than one's neighbors as an ignoble tendency.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passages discuss why people want to make more money and how it relates to happiness.
  Passage B refers to the need to create value as the driving force for people wanting to make more money.
  Passage A refers to people comparing their income to others and only feeling happy if they are doing better than their peers.
  There is no indication in either passage that the person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is altruistic, egocentric, misguided, admirable, insular, cosmopolitan, lucky, or primitive.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare their income with some norm.
  The majority chose the first of the two options in the Solnick and Hemenway study in order to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B states that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful.
  It suggests that the desire to create value benefits society.
  It does not describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric, misguided or primitive.
  It does not describe such a person as cosmopolitan or lucky.
  The best choice is between insular and altruistic.
  A person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors might be described as insular since they are limited to their own little world.
  However, there is no clear evidence in the passage to suggest that someone who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is doing so out of self-interest, or because they are insular.
  The passage indicates that people who want to make more money than their neighbors, do so to create value, which is beneficial for society.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the authors of passage A and B, respectively, would not describe such a person as insular or egocentric but as altruistic.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains that people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income. This comparison is the reason why richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer ones. People compare their income with their reference group to determine their happiness. 
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful, that they have created value. People use material wealth to showcase to others that they are prosperous because they create value. 
  Both passages use evidence from studies to support their claims. 
  None of the choices directly describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. The closest options are egocentric, misguided, and admirable.
  Since both passages argue that people want to earn more money to create value, it seems that the authors would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe this person.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses how people have a tendency to compare their income with a norm that is rising along with actual income.
  According to this passage, people are more likely to invest in material objects to boost their position relative to their reference group.
  Passage B proposes that people want to create value and view themselves as successful due to relative success, not money per se.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors would use the term "misguided" to describe someone wanting to make more money than their neighbors since they propose that people want to create value. 
  Similarly, it is unlikely that they would use the term "primitive" since they propose that the desire to create value benefits society.
  Insular and cosmopolitan are unrelated to the topic of the passages, so those options can be eliminated.
  Altruistic and egocentric are not mentioned in the passages, so those options can also be eliminated.
  To describe someone who wants to make more money than their neighbors, the most likely terms that the authors would use are "misguided" or "primitive."
  Therefore, the answer is D: misguided, admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A mentions that people were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B mentions that the desire to create value benefits society, and it brings happiness.
  None of the passages would use the terms "insular" or "cosmopolitan" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  None of the passages would use the terms "altruistic" or "egocentric" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  None of the passages would use the terms "lucky" or "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of Passage B suggest that the desire to create value benefits society, so they are more likely to use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  The authors of Passage A do not provide information on whether it is misguided or not to want to make more money than one's neighbors, so "misguided" is not the best term to describe such a person.
  Therefore, the answer is D: admirable.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B do not portray wanting to make more money than neighbors as insular, altruistic, happy, misguided or lucky.
  Passage B argues that wanting to make more money than neighbors is evidence of a desire to create value, and it provides happiness. 
  Therefore, the most likely pair of terms that would describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors in respectively passage A and passage B is egocentric and admirable.
  The answer is B: altruistic, egocentric.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Both passages discuss the phenomenon of people comparing themselves with others regarding their income.
  Passage A refers to it as "the phenomenon of rivalry."
  Passage B describes it as a desire to create value.
  Neither of them describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as insular, altruistic, happy, misguided or lucky primitive.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that as the size of a business increases, the production per worker also increases.
  The example of the pin factory shows how increasing returns to scale lead to natural tendency toward monopoly because larger businesses can achieve lower costs than smaller ones.
  Diminishing returns are assumed in free markets where there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the answer should illustrate how larger businesses are able to produce more efficiently and drive smaller ones out of business. 
  Option D describes how the lobster industry is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. This illustrates how the industry is able to improve the productivity of its workers (the traps) leading to greater production per worker (more lobsters caught per trap). 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The paragraph describes that as the size of a firm increases, the specialization of workers can increase as well, giving rise to increasing returns to scale.
  Such increasing returns to scale are characterized by the fact that a larger firm can produce at a lower cost compared to a smaller firm.
  This means that a larger firm has a competitive advantage over a smaller one, ultimately driving smaller firms out of business and leading industries into monopoly power.
  Example A, B, C, and E don't seem to align with this concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Example D says that the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  This implies that increasing the production made by a fixed number of traps can only be achieved by making the traps more efficient, and not increasing their number, thus aligning with the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The paragraph mentions that there are increasing returns to scale. 
  The paragraph also explains the example of a pin factory.
  The example of a pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale - the bigger the pin factory, the more the employees can specialize, and the more pins the factory can produce per worker. 
   Therefore, the answer should provide an example where the increase in size leads to an increase in productivity per worker. 
  The only option that fits this criterion is B, where a larger bee colony has more bees that can specialize in collecting and processing nectar, allowing the colony to collect more nectar to feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale refer to the phenomenon where a larger scale of production results in a higher output per unit of input.
  The example of the pin factory in the passage illustrates that the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be, resulting in a higher output per worker, and thus increasing returns to scale.
  Among the choices, only option B describes a situation where a larger entity is able to specialize in a task and divide up the work for greater efficiency, illustrating the concept of increasing returns to scale. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players.
  The Pin Factory example shows that larger factories that can specialize workers can produce many times more than smaller factories.
  Among the choices, B and E are about colonies dividing and growing larger, which seems to be a kind of increasing returns to scale.
  In choice A, relaxing standards for editors might reduce quality control and lower productivity. This does not seem to be about the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  In choice C, year-round operation may be effective for accommodating students, but it does not seem to be about the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  In choice D, the situation seems like progress from technology not from scaling up. 
  Therefore, the best choice is either B or E, which describe the increasing returns to scale concept. The answer could be either B or E.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The paragraph describes that increasing returns to scale lead to large businesses with lower costs, which drive smaller businesses out of the industry.
  The Pin Factory is the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  The Pin Factory's employees specialize in narrow tasks, producing far more than they could if each worked independently. As a result, the Pin Factory can produce more pins per worker and more than smaller pin factories, leading to lower costs and driving them out of business.
  Therefore, the answer is the Pin Factory.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale describes how an increase in the size of a business could lead to more productivity per worker and hence more output.
  The example of a pin factory in the passage illustrated how the factory's workers became more productive and produced far more than could have been produced if each worker worked independently.
  The passage also says that bigger firms tend to dominate smaller firms, creating a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  Therefore, the answer is the option that illustrates how an increase in scale leads to an increase in productivity.
  Option B presents a large bee colony that uses some bees solely to guard its nectar sources, thereby enabling the colony to collect more nectar that can feed a larger colony that can divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  This situation is analogous to how a pin factory's workers become more productive and produce more than they could if they worked independently.
  Thus, Option B best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The paragraph discusses how larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until the industry is dominated by a few players.
  The paragraph also explains that there are increasing returns to scale where the bigger the factory, the more specialized its workers can be and thus the more productive they can be.
  Therefore, the best answer would be an example of a business that, by increasing its size, is able to increase its productivity.
  Choice A discusses how a publishing house was able to improve productivity by relaxing standards to adhere to. This does not necessarily involve a larger scale.
  Choice B describes the benefits of having guard bees, but the example does not involve increased size.
  Choice C describes how a school district is able to accommodate more students, but it is not necessarily increasing the school district's size.
  Choice D describes how the lobster industry is able to catch more lobsters a day, but it is not necessarily due to an increased size of the fishing operation.
  Choice E describes how larger ant colonies are able to divide and grow to become more prosperous, but the example does not involve a business or economic concept.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The concept of increasing returns to scale is illustrated in the second paragraph of the passage.
  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale refers to the idea that the bigger the factory/business, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more output the factory/business can produce per worker.
  Therefore, the correct answer should be the example that best describes this concept.
  Option A does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option B is talking about the concept of division of labor and specialization but not about increasing returns to scale.
  Option C is not describing anything about a business or factory so it cannot be the right answer.
  Option D describes a scenario where advances in technology make the production process more efficient, which fits the definition of increasing returns to scale.
  Option E describes how two competing ant colonies eventually grow large enough to divide into more colonies, which is not related to increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes that increasing returns to scale emphasizes increased productivity through specialization with bigger size.
  Option A describes a decrease in standards that is not related in any way with increasing returns.
  Option B describes how a bee colony is able to collect more nectar that can feed a larger colony which is not exactly related to the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Option C describes an example of increasing returns to scale, but it is not related to the concept of specialization with bigger size.
  Option D describes an increase in productivity in the lobster industry as a whole because of an advance in technology, which is not related to the concept increasing returns to scale through specialization with bigger size.
  Option E describes an example of increasing returns to scale where two competing colonies grew larger than the original colony.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the signs used by the Sumerians for writing.
  The sign for "sheep" is not a pictograph but an abstract symbol.
  It is represented by a circled cross.
  The passage doesn't provide any indication that it could be replaced without loss of significance by any other sign.
  The passage doesn't compare the sign for "sheep" to the cuneiform sign for "metal" in terms of the way they get their meaning.
  The passage doesn't provide any indication that the way in which it represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  The passage mentions that the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C. and that the seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers, so it implies that the way in which it represents its meaning was the subject of scientific scrutiny.
  The passage doesn't suggest that the abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes how early writing used abstract symbols instead of pictographs.
  One example given is the sign for "sheep".
  The author doesn't offer any speculation about why a circled cross was used for "sheep".
  Therefore, the author would not agree with any of the statements as they are not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
- The passage explains that although the tablets date back to 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs. 
- The sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross.
- The author is most likely to agree that there is a specific reason why the sign for "sheep" uses abstract symbols instead of a pictograph of a sheep.
- The author does not suggest that the abstract nature of the sign reveals anything about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.
- Option A is not correct because the passage does not provide any information about whether the sign for "sheep" could have been replaced without loss of significance. 
- Option B is not correct because the passage does not compare the way in which the cuneiform sign for "sheep" gets its meaning with the way in which the sign for "metal" gets its meaning. 
- Option C is not correct because the passage does not provide any reason to think that the use of abstract symbols to represent the sign for "sheep" has anything to do with the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity.
- Option D is not correct because Schmandt-Besserat is not the only person responsible for scientific scrutiny of the way in which the sign represents its meaning.
- Therefore, the answer is E: The abstract nature of the sign does not reveal anything about the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The passage explains that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. The passage provides no further information that suggests otherwise.

  The author does not explain the significance of sheep being an agricultural commodity.
  The passage does not discuss whether the meaning of the "sheep" sign was previously subject to scientific scrutiny.
  The passage suggests that the tokens are predecessors to the written word.
  Denise Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the tokens contained records of village contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools.
  The token system was replaced in about 3100 B.C. by a system of marks on clay tablets that would eventually evolve into mature writing.
  From the context, there is no clear statement regarding the author's opinion about the sign for "sheep."
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author explains that the sign for "sheep" is not an image of a sheep but rather a circled cross.
  The author does not give any indication that another sign could have replaced the sign for "sheep" without loss of significance.
  The author doesn't discuss the differences in how the sign for "sheep" and the sign for "metal" get their meanings.
  The author doesn't connect the sign for "sheep" to being an agricultural commodity.
  The author states that the sign for "sheep" was not created with the intention of being an image of a sheep.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with D: The way in which it represents its meaning was not the subject of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage mentions the sign for "sheep" in line 6 as an example of an abstract symbol used in the writing system.
  There is no indication that the sign could have been replaced by another without loss of significance or that it was not subjected to scientific scrutiny.
  The passage does not compare the sign for "sheep" with the sign for "metal."
  The passage suggests that all of the abstract symbols were used to represent nouns, so it is likely that the sign for "sheep" was used to represent the noun "sheep."
  Choice A, B, D, and E are not supported by the passage, while choice C seems to make sense and is related to the information in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author mentions the sign for "sheep" in the context of noting the early use of abstract symbols for writing in the Sumerian language.
  The author does not express an opinion regarding whether the sign could have been replaced by another sign.
  There is no comparison between the sign for "sheep" and the sign for "metal" in terms of how their meanings are derived.
  The author does not suggest that the way in which the sign for "sheep" represents its meaning resulted from the fact that sheep were an agricultural commodity.
  In lines 12-13 and 17-19, the author mentions that the tokens, which are predecessors to the written word, include inscriptions that represent units of farm products, such as grain and livestock, which suggests that the sign for "sheep" was used to represent sheep as a product of agriculture.
  The author does not mention any connection between the abstract nature of the sign for "sheep" and the political life of the people who used the language expressed by cuneiform writing.

  The passage does not suggest that the sign for "sheep" is related to the idea that sheep are an agricultural commodity.
  The passage mentions Denise Schmandt-Besserat who theorizes the evolution of the tokens into the mature writing and her work was about the origin of the writing, not its analysis.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author discusses the symbols as abstract and not in pictographic form.
  The author provides an example of the sign for "sheep" and explains how it is represented with a circled cross.
  Based on the text, the author does not suggest that the symbol could have been replaced with any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  Hence, option A is incorrect.
  The author also does not compare it to the sign for "metal" regarding the way it gets its meaning.
  Therefore, option B is not correct.
  The author implies that the abstract symbols were used to represent commodities that were traded.
  The sign for "sheep" represents a commodity, and the author mentions the seals used in the temple-based grain and livestock pools, suggesting that sheep were an agricultural commodity.
  Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Dostoyevsky's position on reality, fantasy, and artistic merit in literature as opposed to the radical critics' views.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was much more profound and subjective than what the radical critics thought, and the fantastic must be ingrained with the tangible reality in a work of art.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand by its artistic merit and not be useful or serve any political views.
  The question asks which view of the radical critics would Dostoyevsky be most softened to.
  Among the choices, only one choice, when recognized by the radical critics, would likely have a positive effect on Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their views.
  Dostoyevsky already believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, so it would not be a factor in his attitude.
  Acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality is opposite to Dostoyevsky's position, so it would not be a factor that would soften his stance.
  Drawing sharper distinctions between reality and fantasy or explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is may not affect Dostoyevsky's position because he believed that reality was already subjective and that art should not be merely useful or serve political views.
  The only choice that could soften Dostoyevsky's position is if the radical critics put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work.
  Therefore, the answer is B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view that art must be useful and serve a particular political view.
  He believed that reality was deeper than what the radical critics demanded and that reality was shaped differently by different people.
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to express one's thoughts in characters and images so that the reader can fully understand the author's thoughts.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must be useful to people and society seemed unsatisfactory to Dostoyevsky.
  Therefore, the correct choice would make Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view most softened.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses Dostoyevsky's position on literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky's position is not aligned with the position of radical critics, who argue that literature should be useful and should depict reality as it is.
  Dostoyevsky believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it.
  Dostoyevsky also believes that a work of literature must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and not on its usefulness or political alignment.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's criticism of the radical critics' view on literature.

  He disagreed with the radical critics that demanded art should serve a particular political view.
  Dostoevsky believed that the task of a writer was to explode the boundaries of the real world.
  He defined artistry as the ability to write well and express thoughts clearly through characters and images.
  The radical critics' requirement that art be useful to people and society was unsatisfactory to Dostoyevsky.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's disagreement with the radical critics' view that art should be useful and serve a particular political view.
  Dostoyevsky believes that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that utility is difficult to predict.
  Based on this, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would most likely be softened if they recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky's position was different from that of radical critics who held that literature should be useful and serve a particular political view. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that reality was not merely tangible but also the fantastic. 
  He believed that artistry meant the ability to write well and express the author's thoughts fully in characters and images. 
  He did not consider the utilitarian claim satisfactory that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear. 
  Dostoyevsky believed that sometimes a work of art may appear to serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful. 
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would be most softened towards the radical critics' view if they were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how Dostoyevsky disagrees with the radical critics' view on literature.
  Dostoyevsky believes that reality is literature's crucial source.
  He thinks that reality can be deeper than what the radical critics describe and can't be depicted "as it is".
  Dostoyevsky defines artistry as the ability to write well.
  He believes that artistic works are the ones that can fulfill their goals, not necessarily the ones that serve a particular political view or are useful to society.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky would approve of the radical critics if they recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the three positions that existed among Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality was different from the prevailing view of the radical critics.
  The radical critics demanded that literature should be useful and reflect reality as it is.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the writer's task was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world and that literary works must stand or fall on their artistic merit.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude would most likely be softened if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's attitude toward literary criticism, particularly the views of the radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was a crucial source for literature, but that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He took a third position, which was deeper than the view of the radical critics.
  He believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, it would be most softened to Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses how Toni Morrison uses music as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz.
The passage highlights the connection between Jazz and the musical form of the jazz musical genre.
The lines 11-16 state that many African American writers have used music and musicians as themes and metaphors in their writing, but none of them drew upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
Therefore, if choice B were true, it would contradict this statement, and the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be called in question.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage argues that while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so.
  Morrison's Jazz is set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 and simulates the style of a jazz performance.
  The narrator in Jazz is generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole.
  The novel's structure is analogous to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.
  The effect Toni Morrison achieved in Jazz is to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that Morrison "found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration" analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand. 
  It does not say that all novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question (C) or that depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature (D).
  It also does not say that even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story (A) or that a small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music (B).
  The answer is E, a smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music. This statement is not addressed in the passage, and the author's argument does not depend on this statement's being true or false. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question asks what the author's assertion would be most called into question if a certain statement were true.
  The statement that needs to be evaluated is "A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music."
  The author's assertion in lines 11-16 is that although African American writers have used music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in Jazz.
  The statement about African American novelists in the early twentieth century basing their work on the structure of blues music, if true, would contradict the author's assertion.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The question refers to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
The author argues that no African American writer has used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Toni Morrison's Jazz.
The author explains how Jazz is structured like a jazz performance, with individual characters "improvising" within the fixed scope of a collective narration.
Therefore, to answer this question, we need to find which choice relates to the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage is discussing the structures of Jazz, a novel by Toni Morrison.
  The structure of Jazz is similar to the structure of jazz music, where individual musicians play within the framework of the composer's vision.
  The narrator in Jazz allows the characters to speak, but the narrator maintains control over the entire narrative, just like the composer's control over the music.
  The author is making a comparison between the structure of Jazz and the structure of jazz music.
  The question is asking which statement, if true, would affect the author's assertion.
  Statement A affirms the author's assertion, so it cannot be the answer.
  Statement B talks about African American novelists basing the form of their work on blues music, which is not related to the author's assertion about Jazz and jazz music, so it cannot be the answer.
  Statement C and D are generalizations about novels and do not specifically relate to Jazz, so they are not related to the author's assertion and cannot be the answer.
  Statement E is discussing the number of North American writers who have written novels about music and does not affect the author's assertion about Jazz and jazz music.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author discusses how writers have aspired to the condition of music in literature.
  The author then discusses how the African American tradition's music is its greatest artistic achievement and how writers in that tradition have used music as a theme and metaphor in writing.
  The author asserts that Toni Morrison is the first to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle of an entire novel.
  The author then discusses how Jazz's narration is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.
  The author explains how Duke Ellington constructed his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind and how Morrison has achieved the same effect in Jazz.
  The author concludes that Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, makes the author's assertion in lines 11-16 the most credible.
  Option A correctly and explicitly supports the author's assertion about the intention of the author of Jazz to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story. Therefore, it is the best answer.
  Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author is discussing the connection between music and literature in the African American tradition.
  The author highlights Toni Morrison's Jazz as the first novel to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  In Jazz, the narrator's voice and the characters' voices are intertwined, much like an ensemble of musicians.
  The author suggests that Jazz simulates the style of a genius of music.
  The author asserts that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it could not be demonstrated that Morrison simulated the style of a genius of music in Jazz.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author is discussing the unique way Toni Morrison used Jazz music as the structuring principle of her novel, Jazz.
  The author explains the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but in the way in which the story is told.
  The author mentions how the narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice to the first-person lyricism of key characters.
  The author believes the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of embedded solo performances.
  The author makes no mention of A, B, D, or E.
  Therefore, none of the other choices are true except for C, but it is not relevant to the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks about the assertion in lines 11-16.
  The passage states that while many African American writers have used music as a theme and a metaphor, none had structured their entire novel after a musical genre until Toni Morrison's Jazz.
  So, the assertion that "A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music" is not mentioned in the passage.
  The assertions, "All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question" and "Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature" are overgeneralizations and cannot be inferred from the passage.
  The assertion that "Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story" is supported by the lines in the passage that state that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration, and that she has simulated the style of a genius of music while exhibiting her own linguistic virtuosity.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author discusses the connection between literature and music, especially in African American literature.
  The author points out that Toni Morrison was the first African American novelist to incorporate a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel in Jazz.
  The author compares the structure of Jazz to the art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected.
  The author suggests that Morrison has found a way to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  The author claims that Morrison has simulated the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called into question if it were claimed that Jazz does not draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  The answer is None of the Above.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence and location of another planet based on Newton's laws and observations of the orbit of Uranus.
  Passage B describes how their prediction was later confirmed when scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune, as described in Passage B, is when Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in rock core samples and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune involved predicting the orbit of a planet and then discovering another planet in that position.
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but the prediction was incorrect.
  To account for the failure of the prediction, they changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets and hypothesized that another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune, could produce the observed orbit.
  They later discovered Neptune, which was in the position that they had predicted.
  So, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is one where a planet was predicted to exist based on another planet's orbit and was later discovered in the predicted position.
  The only choice that describes such a scientific episode is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how the discovery of Neptune was made by observing an anomaly in Uranus's orbit and then hypothesizing the existence of another planet that would produce the observed orbit.
  The other episodes are also relevant scientific discoveries but are different from what happened in the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, C, D, or E.
  Answer B is about Hubble's discovery of Andromeda, which led to settling the debate about the size of the universe.
  This episode is not a relevant analogy to Neptune's discovery, which is about observing an anomaly in Uranus's orbit and hypothesizing a planet to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the answer is also not B.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  In passage B, scientists discovered the planet Neptune after observing that the predictions of Uranus' orbit were incorrect. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus, which was later found to be Neptune.
  The process followed by scientists in the discovery of Uranus comprises of generating a theory to predict the orbit, using auxiliary premises, and altering premises or generating new ones when the observations fail.
  Similarly, the discovery of Neptune involves predicting the presence of a new planet (an auxiliary theory) to demonstrate the current theory's accuracy.
  Options A, C, D, and E describe scientific discoveries that do not use auxiliary theories to predict the observed phenomena.
  Option B describes an astronomical discovery that led to the settlement of a debate about the nature of the observed phenomenon.
  Therefore, based on the analogical reasoning stated above, Option B is not analogous to the discovery of Neptune as described in Passage B.
  The answer is not B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In the passage B, astronomers made predictions of Uranus' orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. They found out that their predictions were incorrect. 
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune. 
  They later discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of Neptune itself.
  The answer is choice None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune, which involved astronomers using Newton's laws and other auxiliary assumptions to predict the orbit of Uranus. 
  When their predictions were incorrect, astronomers hypothesized that another planet must exist, which they called Neptune. 
  They later discovered Neptune in the precise place it needed to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations. 
  This is analogous to a situation where scientists make a prediction based on a theory and auxiliary assumptions but are not able to observe what they predicted. 
  They hypothesize that other factors must exist that explain their observations, and they later discover those factors. 
  Choice B describes such a situation. Edwin Hubble observed "variable stars" and discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe. 
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions. However, when they observed the orbit, they found it did not match their predictions. They hypothesized the existence of another planet which they called Neptune, and after its discovery, they found that it explained the previously unexplained orbit. 
  Among the other episodes:
  - A, B, D, and E do not involve hypothesizing the existence of a previously unknown entity to explain the observed phenomenon.
  - C involves hypothesizing the cause of a phenomenon based on observations, but does not involve hypothesizing the existence of a previously unknown entity. 
  Therefore, none of the episodes except for B is analogous to the discovery of Neptune. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes astronomers making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. When the predictions were not borne out, they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune, and later astronomers discovered it. 
  Choice A describes Galileo's theory of tides which falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two. This is not related to Neptune.
  Choice B describes Edwin Hubble discovering that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This is not related to Neptune.
  Choice C describes Walter Alvarez postulating that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. This is not related to Neptune.
  Choice D describes Bernard Brunhes discovering rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. This is not related to Neptune.
  Choice E describes Wolfgang Pauli postulating that a third undetected particle is also created during neutron decay. This is not related to Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe. (Note: This is not related to Neptune, but it is the most analogous scientific episode to the discovery of Neptune.) 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage B discusses the discovery of a planet.
  Astronomers predicted the existence of the planet based on observations of Uranus.
  Their predictions were not initially borne out.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet that would explain their observations.
  That planet was later discovered in the predicted location.
  The discovery of Neptune is similar to the discovery of a planet.
  The other passages talk about different scientific discoveries.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how astronomers discovered the planet Neptune.
  They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  A different scientific episode most analogous to this is one where scientists hypothesize the existence of a previously unknown entity, based on a mismatch between predictions and observations.
  Choice A is about a false prediction made by Galileo's theory of tides, which was later amended to take into account the influence of the moon.
  Choice B is about Edwin Hubble's discovery that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right, rather than a star.
  Choice C is about Walter Alvarez's postulation that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, which was later confirmed by the discovery of a large impact crater in the Yucatan Peninsula.
  Choice D is about Bernard Brunhes's discovery of rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field, which supported the theory of magnetic field reversals.
  Choice E is about Wolfgang Pauli's postulation of the existence of a third undetected particle that explains the discrepancy in the energy of particles during decay.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author believes that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not useful in guiding policy decisions. 
  The author supports that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.

  In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would agree with the statement that government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  The answer is that the author would most likely agree with statement D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author explains the fallacy of the notion of voluntary and involuntary risks regarding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that "the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction."
  The author implies that the distinction of voluntary and involuntary when it comes to regulating policies is inadequate because risks are not always entirely voluntary or involuntary.
  The author suggests that policy experts focus on "aggregate lives at stake," while laypeople care whether a risk is voluntary.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear.
  The author suggests that policy decisions should not be based on notions of voluntariness but on other considerations.
  The author argues that the government should try to save as many lives as possible given the limited resources.
  None of the choices match the author's argument completely, but choice A comes close.
  The author does not state anything about plane crashes being more dangerous than risks incurred by airline passengers in general.
  The author argues against basing regulatory policy on notions of voluntariness.
  The passage does not refer to natural disasters as the main category of risk that is usually incurred involuntarily.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks.
  The author believes that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" are often of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author believes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  None of the statements given in the choices is an exact match with the author's opinion.
  However, statement D is the closest to the author's idea that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are subject to that risk only when they make a particular choice.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author talks about the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk.
  The author points out that people usually care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily.
  People often use the notion of voluntariness as proxies.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that aligns with the above ideas.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author suggests that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is often not useful in guiding policy decisions.
  The author recommends making regulatory policy based on a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgements about voluntariness, with the government attempting to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Answer choice A suggests that people should not be protected against the risks incurred through dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose. The author does not support this idea and argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not always clear-cut, and that the government should attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited resources.
  Answer choice B is focused on policy experts' view on whether the risk in question is voluntarily incurred. But, it is not about the author's agreement.
  Answer choice C is not discussed in the passage.
  Answer choice D is consistent with the author's argument for regulatory policy. The author recommends for the government to attempt to save as many lives as possible, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Answer choice E is not discussed in the passage.
  
Therefore, the answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" are often based on confusion and selective attention, and are of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The author also suggests that the government should save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that supports this argument.
  Statement A is too extreme and argues for people not to be protected at all, which is not consistent with the author's argument.
  Statement B is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that policy experts tend to care about aggregate lives at stake and that laypeople care whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily.
  Statement C is not supported by the passage.
  Statement D is consistent with the author's argument that voluntariness should not be used as the main criterion to determine government intervention.
  Statement E is not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The author argues against making the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks when it comes to guiding policy decisions. 
The author also argues that regulatory policy should be guided by saving as many lives as possible.
Option A is incorrect as the passage does not argue that dangerous activities that serve no socially useful purpose should not be protected.
Option B is incorrect as the passage does not mention policy expert’s view on the relevance of the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly.
Option C is incorrect as the passage does not compare the probability of plane crashes to any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
Option D is correct as the passage argues that for public policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred only if people are subject to that risk only if they make a particular choice.
Option E is incorrect as the passage does not mention natural disasters as a category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage explains that the ozone layer of the stratosphere screens out ultraviolet radiation from the sun. The passage also explains that CFCs are responsible for breaking down the ozone layer. Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a public policy change when they discovered that CFCs were causing the depletion of the ozone layer. The passage mentions nothing about the incidents of skin cancer decreasing when CFCs are regulated. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  Chlorine is a byproduct of CFCs and has a devastating effect on the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to increased ultraviolet radiation on the Earth's surface which contributes to skin cancer.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
  Therefore, the regulation of CFCs indirectly contributes to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains that ultraviolet radiation contributes to skin cancer.
  It also explains that CFCs, when introduced into the stratosphere, destroy the protective ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer results in increased ultraviolet radiation on the earth's surface, leading to an increased incidence of skin cancer.
  Therefore, the regulation of CFCs contributes to the prevention of skin cancer.
  Hence, the answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how chlorine in the stratosphere contributes to the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The passage does not state that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present. So, A is incorrect.
  The passage does state that ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer. However, it is not the primary cause. So, B is also incorrect.
  The passage focuses on CFCs and their impact on the ozone layer. It does not mention other chemicals that can release chlorine into the upper atmosphere. So, C is incorrect.
  The passage describes how the depletion of the ozone layer contributes to an increase in ultraviolet radiation, which is linked to skin cancer. Therefore, D seems to be the most strongly supported statement.
  The passage does not mention that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica. Therefore, E is incorrect.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage explains how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. 
  The ozone layer is a thin, diffuse layer of ozone, which is a toxic form of oxygen in the stratosphere, 10 to 25 miles above the earth's surface.
  The manufacturing and use of CFCs result in the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer contributes to skin cancer development.
  Molina and Rowland became public advocates for the ban on CFCs production.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The depletion of the ozone layer lets through more ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  Ultraviolet radiation can cause skin cancer in humans.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can indirectly lower the incidence of skin cancer.
  The answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the effect of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  CFCs are highly volatile chemicals that chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  The increase of concentration of chlorine due to CFCs is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The work of Molina and Rowland, and their advocacy for dramatic policy changes, led to the development of an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  The passage does not support statements B, C, or E.
  There is no direct information in the passage that regulates the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  Choice A seems to be the closest to the information in the passage.
  Ultraviolet radiation from the sun contributes to skin cancer and a thin layer of ozone in the stratosphere screens out much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation.
  When CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, and diffuse upward into the stratosphere caused by ultraviolet radiation, the resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, choice A is the best-supported statement.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) attack and deplete the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
  The depletion of the ozone layer diminishes its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  It also discusses the advocacy of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland for policy changes to address the depletion of the ozone layer.
  The international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases resulted from their work and the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica.
  None of the choices directly mentions the information about advocacy of policy changes and the international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  Choice D is the most logical based on the information in the passage because regulating the use of CFCs leads to lower depletion of the ozone layer, which in turn, indirectly lowers the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the relation between the ozone layer depletion and CFCs chemical reaction in the stratosphere, which releases chlorine and destroys the ozone layer.
- The passage argues that skin cancer is related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, which is not completely blocked by the ozone layer.
- There is no mention of whether other chemicals can release chlorine into the upper atmosphere.
- The passage indicates that the Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned the production of ozone-depleting gases, which includes CFCs, and this led to more environmentally friendly chemicals.
- The passage suggests that the depletion of the ozone layer contributes to the incidence of skin cancer.
- Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is that D) Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The passage explains the relationship between the depletion of the ozone layer and the release of CFCs into the atmosphere.
- CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
- This chemical reaction between CFCs and ozone results in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere, which leads to the depletion of the ozone layer.
- Regular use of CFCs increases the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere, leading to the destruction of the ozone layer.
- The depletion of the ozone layer leads to excessive absorption of ultraviolet light, which contributes to skin cancer.
- The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was created to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases, including CFCs.
- The banning of CFCs would contribute directly to the reduction in the depletion of the ozone layer, and subsequently, the reduction in skin cancer.
- Statement A is incorrect, considering natural production and destruction of the gas (ozone) in rough equilibrium occur in the stratosphere that does not involve chlorine.
- Statement B is incorrect because the passage states that excessive absorption of ultraviolet light contributes to skin cancer, but it does not give any information that it is the primary cause of skin cancer.
- Statement C is incorrect, as the passage does not mention any other chemicals that result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
- Statement D is correct because skin cancers occur primarily due to excessive absorption of ultraviolet light that is prevented by the ozone layer. The banning of CFCs would reduce the depletion of the ozone layer, leading to lower ultraviolet radiation absorption and, consequently, a reduction in skin cancer.
- Statement E is incorrect because the passage does not say that the upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 states the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense to their clients regardless of their personal beliefs about their guilt or innocence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that lawyers should not present assertions they know to be false and that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 support the position that defense lawyers should not act on personal beliefs regarding the guilt or innocence of their clients.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that of elaboration and support.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Lines 7-11 say that some legal scholars believe that defense lawyers have no right to judge defendants and that their responsibility is to provide the best defense to the clients.
  Lines 28-31 state that lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  The two sentences are essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives because they both deal with the responsibility of defense lawyers, but the sentence at lines 28-31 provides additional details by specifying what lawyers should do when they are convinced that their clients are guilty.
  The sentences do not contradict each other, nor do they represent the same point of view.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 state the duty of defense lawyers to not deny their client's guilt if they know it to be true and to argue for whatever degree of leniency the lawyer sincerely believe is warranted.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 establishes the role of defense lawyers as advocates who provide the best defense possible for their clients.
  The author is discussing the ethical obligations of defense lawyers to their clients, courts and society.
  It seems that the two sentences are a further explanation of the lawyer's duty to the court and society.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that they provide more information on the lawyer's duty to the court and society.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about one of the opinions presented by some legal scholars.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 state that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 support the idea that lawyers should not defend someone who they know is guilty.
  This statement agrees with the earlier position presented in lines 7-11 where lawyers' sole obligation is not to express or act on personal opinions.
  So, the correct answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought process: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 concern the duty of defense lawyers to represent their clients sincerely.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the obligation of defense lawyers to provide the best defense and not to judge defendants.
  The two statements both relate to the role of the defense lawyer but focus on different aspects of this role.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sets of sentences is one of complementarity, and the answer is not A.
  The statement in lines 28-31 neither opposes nor supports the earlier position but rather complements it by providing further detail in its duty to sincerely represent clients.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
  The statement at lines 28-31 does not present a hypothetical situation, and therefore, the answer is not C.
  The statement at lines 28-31 does not agree with the earlier position but presents a different perspective on the defense lawyer's duty, and therefore, the answer is not D.
  The correct choice is E, which states that the two sentences convey similar assertions from different perspectives. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states the lawyer should not try to demonstrate their guilty clients' innocence.
  The earlier text states that defense lawyers should provide the best defense they are capable of for their clients.
  The author states that the obligation of the lawyer is twofold.
  The author notes that lawyers should not present false assertions to the court and that guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation.
  According to the author, lawyers should try to appraise cases in their client's favor.
  The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society ultimately benefits the defendant.
  The sentence at lines 28-31 serves as an example to further illustrate the author's position on when lawyers should represent their clients and when they should not.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can be described as supporting the author's earlier position.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states the lawyer's responsibility is twofold: to the defendant and to society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 introduces the topic of the article, questioning if it is necessary for defense lawyers to believe that their clients are innocent of the charges against them.
  The paragraphs that follow explain the scholars' and the author's opinions about the lawyer's role.
  The opinions of the scholars oppose the position that lawyers have an obligation to believe in their clients' innocence.
  The author does not agree with the scholars’ position and explains that lawyers should not deny or present assertions that they know to be false, but they should try to prove their clients innocent if they believe they are.
  Therefore, the information contained in the two sentences shows the author's position that lawyers should not defend clients they know are guilty and should not present false or insincere representation.
  The relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7–11 is that the information in the former explains the author's position on the topic introduced in the latter.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The portion in lines 28-31 talks about the obligation of defense lawyers.
  The portion in lines 7-11 talks about the different opinions/legal arguments about defense lawyers' obligation to believe their clients are innocent or not.
  The argument in lines 28-31 supports the position that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court/society.
  The portion in lines 7-11 also argues that defense lawyers' obligation is not only to the defendant but also to provide the best possible legal representation.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information in both passages is that they represent two different positions regarding the obligation of defense lawyers.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 explains that some legal scholars believe lawyers should provide the best defense possible, not judge defendants.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 describe the obligation of lawyers to not present assertions they know to be false.
  Both sentences express the notion that lawyers have an obligation to provide a defense for their clients.
  However, the sentence at lines 28-31 provides more specific guidance on how lawyers should fulfill this obligation.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 do not oppose the earlier position, but further clarify the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society.
  The relationship between the two sets of sentences can be described as "essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives."

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage provides information that most helps to answer which one of the following questions?

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Topic: Law
Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the subtractive method used to interpret FMRI scans of brain activity.
  This method subtracts a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task, so that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, which produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
  Therefore, we are looking for a choice that describes a method that also produces a false impression of neat functional localization by selectively omitting some data.
  The only choice that describes such a method is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes that FMRI scans depict differential rate of oxygen use in certain parts of the brain during cognitive tasks.
  The method of FMRI scans involves subtracting a baseline brain activity from the brain activity during cognitive tasks.
  This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to the described method of interpreting FMRI scans.
  Choice B is the best analogy as it describes an increase in shoppers only during the summer season because of a year-long advertising campaign, which is similar to how FMRI scans depict only the differential rate of oxygen use in response to cognitive tasks.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  According to the passage, a baseline measurement is taken in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement and whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  Therefore, the way FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to subtracting one measurement from another to determine the difference.
  Choice B is similar because it involves comparing two groups (yearlong advertising campaign and summer shoppers) to determine the effect of the campaign on the shoppers.
  However, choice E is too dissimilar as it discusses the cheetah's ability to outrun other animals over long distances, while the passage discusses brain scans and their interpretation.
  Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The FMRI's are usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is obtained by subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, there must be a situation in which a differential rate is obtained by subtracting a baseline measurement to reveal the impact of a specific element of the situation.
  Option B describes a situation in which there is an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements have only affected the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain that stands as a measure of metabolic activity and that actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use through subtraction.
  The subtractive method of FMRI interpretation produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the subtractive method of FMRI interpretation is most analogous to the way internet traffic is typically highest during the evening hours and originates from homes rather than from office buildings.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method used in interpreting FMRI scans is subtractive, where a baseline measurement is taken in the control condition, then a measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
  The result of the subtraction is thought to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question, giving a false impression of neat functional localization by obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Option A discusses how a particular district voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option B talks about a store launching a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option C says that much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option D explains that internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option E states that the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Therefore, none of the options is analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are a measure of metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The interpretation of these scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
  The resulting differential measurement is thought to represent only the metabolic activity of the cognitive task.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, we need to find an option that describes a situation where some aspect is obscured or overlooked while considering a larger whole.
  Option A describes how one district's vote contributed significantly to a mayoral win.
  Option B refers to the increase in summer shoppers due to a yearlong advertising campaign.
  Option C describes how droughts impact the agricultural sector more severely than they do on residential customers.
  Option D refers to the origin of the highest Internet traffic during peak hours.
  Option E describes how the cheetah is the fastest animal but only for short distances, and they cannot outrun other animals over long distances.
  None of the options seem to be closely analogous to FMRI scans' interpretation.
  Therefore, "None of the Above" is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The interpretation involves a subtraction method where the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The method gives an impression of functional localization, but actually, the whole brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for the analogy of this interpretation method.
  Option A describes how a particular district helped the mayor win the election.
  Option B describes how a yearlong advertising campaign affected only the summer shoppers.
  Option C describes how the agricultural sector is impacted more than the residential sector during droughts.
  Option D describes how most Internet traffic during peak hours originates from homes rather than office buildings.
  Option E describes how the cheetah is the fastest land animal only for short distances.
  None of the options seem to resemble the interpretation method of FMRI scans described in the passage.
  However, option B seems to relate to the relationship between two variables in a given situation. This is analogous to the FMRI method of subtracting out the baseline measurement and isolating the on-task measurement to determine the relationship between brain activity and specific cognitive tasks.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage provides information about the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted using a subtractive method.
  The FMRI scans are subtractive in that the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is what is depicted by FMRI scans, not the entire brain activity, which obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B involves an advertising campaign and a seasonal increase in shoppers, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C explains the usage of water supply by different sectors, but is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is about the time of day when Internet traffic is highest and is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is about the cheetah as the world's fastest animal and is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans. 
  The FMRI scan provides information about the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. 
  So the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and depicted as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, the FMRI scan is actually the result of a subtraction of the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  One problem with the subtraction method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the interpretation of the FMRI scan is analogous to the subtraction method.
  Choice B is similar to the FMRI scan interpretation in that the increase in shoppers only during the summer is interpreted as the result of a yearlong advertising campaign.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 0:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues against approaching the study of other cultures solely from the perspective of Western scientific methods. It suggests that the scientific method is based on specific values that may not align with the values of the culture being studied. The objection argues that the dominant form of thought and language of non-Western cultures are often myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight. 
A: This statement is too extreme and suggests that there can be no understanding of a culture's values outside the culture that developed them.
B: This statement is consistent with the objection discussed in the second paragraph, emphasizing the importance of considering a culture's social and historical context.
C: Although this statement contains a grain of truth (multicultural education can benefit from multiple cultural perspectives), it is not directly related to the objection discussed in the second paragraph.
D: This statement is too extreme; cultural values can be understood without sharing those values.
E: This statement supports the objection discussed in the second paragraph by emphasizing that liberalism can be misunderstood if studied solely through Western scientific methods.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
The objection raised in the second paragraph is mainly about the Western scientific heritage and its impact on the study of other values and cultures. The critics believe that examining non-Western cultures from a Western scientific perspective is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. So, the answer should reflect this belief.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The critics of the second version of multicultural education hold that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, logical over the intuitive, and empirically verifiable over the mystical. They argue that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first since it still uses identifiably Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Option A is opposite to what the critics argue. They argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
Option B is different from what the critics argue, but it is in line with the description of the first proposal and its advocates.
Option C is not in line with what the critics argue. They do not argue for multiple cultural perspectives but instead argue that the Western method of examination and study of cultures is incomplete and distorting.
Option D is also opposite to what the critics argue. They do not suggest that cultures can only be understood if they share the same cultural values.
Option E, on the other hand, is in line with what the critics argue. They hold that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first since it still uses Western scientific methods to understand other cultures. The critics suggest that only by adopting the often nonscientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied can genuine understanding be achieved. Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 3:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that understanding of other cultures cannot be achieved if we only examine them through Western scientific methods.
Therefore, the critics who raise this objection would likely agree that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is regarding the methodology of the second version of multicultural education.
This methodology advocates for adopting a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
Critics argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden.
Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.
The objection suggests that to understand other cultures, one must adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the objection raised in the paragraph.
Option B may be true but does not necessarily reflect the objection raised by the critics.
Option C is not directly related to the objection raised in the paragraph.
Option D is incorrect because it is in direct opposition to the objection raised in the paragraph.
Option E is consistent with the objection raised by the critics, who argue that the methods of Western science may not be adequate for understanding the values of cultures that are not based on Western scientific perspectives.
Therefore, the correct answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The objection raised in the paragraph states that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. 
  Critics also argue that not all cultures share liberal values and their value systems cannot be understood if we approach them solely from within the majority culture's perspective.
  Therefore, the critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would most likely agree with option A, which also discusses social and historical circumstances being important in the development of a culture's values. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The critics who raised the objection presented in the second paragraph argue that to understand other cultures, it is not adequate to approach them solely from the perspective of Western science. The critics believe that using the methods of Western science to examine other cultures is already value-laden and it involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. They argue that to understand other cultures, one must adopt the perspectives and methods of those cultures.
Option A is too narrow and does not capture the critics' objection. 
Option B is consistent with the critics' objection but does not fully capture their view.
Option C goes beyond the scope of the discussion in the passage.
Option D is not a view held by the critics in the passage and it is too extreme.
Option E is consistent with the critics' view that the methods of Western science are not adequate to understand liberal values.
Therefore, the best answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The objection discussed in the second paragraph is that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is approached solely from within the majority culture's perspective.
The objection is based on the idea that each culture should be taken on its own terms, independent of the values of the majority culture.
The second proposal suggests adopting a neutral stance with respect to value differences among cultures, but the methods of examination are still Western.
Critics of the second proposal argue that the methods of Western science are already value-laden and that genuine understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied.
These critics would be most likely to agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The critics of the second proposal of multicultural education argue that it is not different from the first because it still uses Western scientific methods, which are already value-laden. According to them, using Western methods to understand non-Western cultures is a form of cultural chauvinism.
Therefore, they would be most likely to agree with the option that says that understanding a culture depends on using the perspective and methods of that culture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that real understanding of other cultures can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied. 
This objection is critical of the second version of multicultural education.
The objection argues that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures already involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity and are Western-centric, which is not sufficient to gain a real understanding of other cultures.
The answer should reflect this objection.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
The "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) is what jurors use to filter subsequent information through this schema.
The paragraph discusses how early positive framing can guide jurors, and when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors.
Therefore, the author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create primarily to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
The answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the implications of recent findings in neuroscience on the law. It suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution which is now dominant as a justification of punishment.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will, how it can coexist with determinism, and how actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It suggests that actions that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
  The question is asking about the attitude towards the ideas presented in each passage.
  Passage A is more focused on how recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about the law, and suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution.
  Passage B is more focused on the concept of free will, and suggests that actions that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
  Passage A is more concerned about the implications of neuroscience on the law, while Passage B is more concerned about the concept of free will.
  The attitude towards the ideas in Passage A seems to be more skeptical or critical of the current approach of the criminal-justice system, while the attitude towards the ideas in Passage B is more detached and academic.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A talks about how recent findings in neuroscience change the way we think about law and how the criminal-justice system should focus more on deterring future harms.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that all human action is caused by the operations of the brain, which should change the way we think about the law. It argues that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution in favor of deterrence.
  Passage B, on the other hand, presents a different perspective on determinism, and argues that the idea of free will can coexist with determinism. It suggests that there is a difference between free actions and constrained actions.
  Therefore, Passage B differs from Passage A in that it presents a different view on determinism and explores the idea of free will.
  The passage does not display an attitude that is dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical.
  The passage is more engaged in discussing and presenting a specific perspective.

  It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  It makes an analogy that actions and wills originating from a disease-free brain are free even though they may be determined.
  Passage B is discussing a different perspective on determinism and free will, but it is not being dismissive of the ideas presented in Passage A.
  The passage seems to present the ideas in a studied and objective manner, which suggests a detached tone.
  Therefore, the answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question is asking to compare the different attitudes displayed in Passage A and Passage B.
  Passage A argues that the law should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms, based on neuroscience research.
  Passage B discusses a philosophical theory of "soft determinism" that argues actions can still be free even in a deterministic world, and the discussion of the brain's role is used as an analogy.
  Although Passage B mentions the brain's role, it does not directly discuss neuroscience research.
  Analyzing the tone of Passage B, it discusses a philosophical theory and is focused on making a distinction between different types of actions.
  It presents its arguments in a matter-of-fact tone, without engaging with or dismissing other ideas.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this version are still identifiably Western.
  The critics argue that using the methods of Western science is distorting, not only not essentially different from the first version, and maintains a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The objection is that only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, a choice that supports this objection would weaken the criticism.

Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses critics' objection to the second version of multicultural education.
  Critics argue that the second version of multicultural education is not different from the first.
  They argue that scientific examination of cultures involves commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  The objection is that understanding of non scientific cultures cannot be achieved only by the methods of Western science.
  The question asks which of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
  The answer should suggest that the second version of multicultural education is different from the first, in which multicultural education should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture.
  Among the answer choices, C says that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, indicating that the second version of multicultural education is different from the first.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage presents two versions of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education takes a neutral stance towards the value differences among cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the Western scientific methodology is value-laden and thus cannot be used to understand non-Western cultures.
  The question asks for an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  The objection should show that the Western scientific methodology can still be used to understand non-Western cultures despite being value-laden.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the discussion of the objection.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the discussion of the objection.
  Choice C is not a strong objection because it only shows that some non-Western societies use their own value system instead of adopting the Western scientific methodology when studying cultures with different values.
  Choice D is not a strong objection because the passage does not discuss the need for understanding Western culture through Western scientific investigations.
  Choice E is not a strong objection because it only reiterates the importance of genuine understanding which is not in dispute.
  Therefore, none of the choices provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education says that to understand non-western cultures, it is necessary to use the perspective and methods of those cultures.
  The strongest objection should argue that it is possible to understand a non-western culture without adopting its perspective and methods.
  Choice A - Argues that adopting a different culture's perspective and methods is impossible which supports the criticism.
  Choice B - Suggests that non-western societies share value systems, but it is not directly relevant to the criticism.
  Choice C - Suggests that some non-western societies use their own value systems when studying cultures which is irrelevant to the criticism.
  Choice D - Argues that it is necessary to treat Western scientific investigations as the subject of study when trying to understand Western culture. This is not directly relevant to non-western cultures and so is not the strongest objection.
  Choice E - This statement agrees with the criticism.
  Therefore, none of the options provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not different from the first version because the methods of examining cultures in this version are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. 
  Thus, the choice to examine and understand other cultures by Western scientific methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity and is therefore not different from the first proposal.
  So, the strongest objection to this criticism would be a statement that challenges the aforementioned assumptions and claims. 
  Option C, which states that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values, would provide an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that adopting Western scientific methods is still distorting when trying to understand other cultures.
  A response to this criticism would be evidence that using Western scientific methods to examine other cultures would not be distorting.
  Option A is irrelevant to this argument since it does not address how to understand other cultures.
  Option B is also irrelevant since it does not address whether using Western scientific methods is distorting when examining other cultures.
  Option C is also irrelevant because it doesn't demonstrate why using Western scientific methods to study other cultures is not distorting.
  Option D is also irrelevant because the argument is not about understanding Western achievements, but understanding other cultures.
  Option E is also irrelevant because it is not a response to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  None of options provides a response to the criticism of the Western scientific methods of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first as it involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  The objection is that to understand non-scientific cultures, one needs to adopt their perspectives and methods of examination, study, and explanation.
  The strongest objection will provide a counterargument to the objection.
  Option A, if true, would support the objection.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C could provide some support to the objection, but it does not make it stronger.
  Option D is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option E also supports the objection.
  Therefore, the strongest objection is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms but still adopts the methods of Western science.
  Critics of this version argue that scientific discourse is often not the dominant form of thought and language of non-Western cultures.
  To achieve real understanding, the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied need to be adopted.
  The question asks us to find the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Therefore, we need to find an answer that weakens the criticism of the second version.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The second version of multicultural education is criticized because it uses Western scientific methods, which are value-laden, to examine and understand other cultures.
  The objection to this argument is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be an argument that supports the idea that using Western scientific methods to study other cultures is not problematic.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C is too weak to be considered a strong objection.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the argument.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that adopting Western scientific methods and perspectives is not enough to achieve genuine understanding of a non-Western culture.
  The objection is that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the culture studied.
  To provide the strongest objection to this criticism, we need to suggest a way in which adopting Western scientific methods and perspectives could lead to genuine understanding.
  Therefore, the correct answer should provide an argument that shows how Western scientific methods and perspectives can lead to genuine understanding.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objection that proponents of the second version of multicultural education would have concerning the use of Western scientific methods in understanding other cultures.
  According to the objection, understanding and appreciation of other cultures cannot be achieved by applying Western scientific methods alone.

Thought: 
  The third paragraph argues that the second version of multicultural education, which advocates neutrality towards different values of cultures while still relying on Western scientific methods to study them, is still based on a value system that favors objectivity and pragmatism over other ways of thinking of non-Western cultures. 
  Therefore, proponents of this version of multicultural education are likely to object to any study that involves using Western scientific methods to investigate a non-scientific culture.
  Among the answer choices, the only option that can be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education is C, which involves using scientific methods to investigate a non-scientific culture.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.

Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, suggesting that it is unlikely that patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. Therefore, the author might agree least with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal and there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  The author might not agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The other statements are either stated or implied in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal and there are no effective therapy available yet.
  The passage does not mention anywhere that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The passage also explains that prions can reproduce themselves without nucleic acid and the body does not produce an immune response against them.
  The author agrees with the above statements.
  Based on the above analysis, it can be inferred that the author would be least likely to agree with statement B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage indicates the characteristics of a prion and how it causes disease.
  There is no information about patients with CJD being able to recover.
  It is mentioned that prions do not require nucleic acid for reproduction, and that they naturally exist as proteins in the body.
  The author explains how the body does not produce an immune response when prions are present and the disease is inevitably fatal.
  The author also mentions that scientists have a lot to learn about the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD, which led to the isolation of a disease agent called prion.
  The passage explains that prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into an abnormal pathogenic conformation, and this cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. 
  The passage states that prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, and it is difficult to prevent the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, so CJD is inevitably fatal.
  The passage clearly indicates that there are no effective therapies to cure CJD.
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease (Choice B).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how CJD is caused by prions.
  Prions are a new type of protein pathogen that reproduce by initiating a chain reaction that induces normal prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The passage also states that "CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses."
  Therefore, the author would be least likely to agree with option B, which says some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author explains that CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are variations in the progression of the disease.
  It is clear from the passage that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author provides evidence that abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue are linked to neurological disease.
  The passage makes no mention of patients recovering from CJD.
  The author explains that the body does not produce an immune response against prions because they occur naturally in the body.
  The author states that scientists do not fully understand how prions reproduce and destroy nerve cells.
  Based on the above points, the author would least likely agree with (B) - Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that CJD is inevitably fatal, therefore there is no cure or recovery for patients currently infected.
  The passage also explains that prions only exist as proteins, so the immune system does not respond to them when they are present. This suggests that there are no natural defenses against CJD.
  The passage discusses in detail the process of prion reproduction which results in nerve cell destruction. Therefore, since the passage contains more information about the mechanisms underlying prion-induced diseases, it is unlikely that the author would disagree with the statement that "scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce."
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with statement B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes extensively the lethal effects of CJD.
  The author provides support to the idea that prions are a new type of pathogen that cause this disease.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  To respond rationally to economic incentives or disincentives means to consider the expected utility of the actions and weigh the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  Answer choice A describes a person who considers the expected utility of the action.
  Answer choice B describes a person who considers the expected utility of the action.
  Answer choice C describes a person who considers the expected utility of the action.
  Answer choice D describes a person who considers the expected utility of the action.
  Answer choice E describes a person who physically assaults his former supervisor because he believed he was unfairly dismissed. This is not an economic response, nor does it consider the expected utility of the action.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The utility maximization principle suggests that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
The principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Expected utility is ascertained by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
The economic principle of utility maximization assumes that individuals are rational and that they respond rationally to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice A, B, and D can be described as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice C can be considered as an irrational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice E can be considered as an impulsive crime and does not involve rational decision making.
Therefore, the least appropriately described response to economic incentives and disincentives would be E, so the answer is E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that people make a rational choice when choosing between different options based on the expected utility of each option.
  A person's decision could involve the rational weighing of the expected benefits and costs of the decision.
  A, B, C, and D illustrate situations in which an individual may weigh the expected benefits and costs of a decision before making a rational choice.
  E involves emotional behavior and does not seem to involve a rational weighing of benefits and costs.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that within the utility maximization principle, an individual choice to commit a crime is analyzed based on economic incentives.
  Economic incentives are defined as the positive or negative consequences of an action, whether legal or illegal, that affect an individual's decision to carry out the action.
  The passage suggests that a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is a choice that maximizes an individual's anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The passage also explains that the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Option A suggests that an individual is concealing income in order to reduce taxes which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option B suggests that an individual is avoiding speeding on a stretch of road which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option C suggests that an industrialist is continuing to illegally discharge untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  This is a rational response to economic disincentives as the cost of the treatment outweighs the cost of the fines.
  Option D suggests that a government official is soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  This is a rational economic decision because the official needs more income to support herself and her family.
  Option E suggests that a worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
  This is not a rational economic decision, because it is not based on maximizing anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Therefore, the answer is E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The economic principle discussed states that a rational individual will choose an action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle further states that the expected utility of an action is based on the probability of the outcomes of that action and the utility of each outcome.
  Therefore, an action that is not based on any consideration of the utility of the outcome cannot be described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Among the given choices, only E is not based on any economic considerations. Therefore, E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that actors will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  To be a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, the action taken should be similar to criminal activity, where people weigh the expected utility of the cost and benefits of an action.
  The answer is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives, so we need to find an action that does not weigh the expected utility of the cost and benefits of an action.
  A and B give examples of people who are rational in their responses to economic incentives and disincentives.
  C describes an individual who weighs the cost of treatment against the cost of the fine and decides to continue an illegal activity.
  D gives an example of an individual who weighs the risk of prosecution against the benefits of soliciting bribes, which is a rational economic decision.
  E describes a person who commits an impulsive crime, which is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that people make rational decisions according to the expected utility of their actions.
  Utility is defined as the overall satisfaction one obtains from taking an action.
  Expected utility is determined by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action against the likelihood of each outcome's occurrence.
  A rational response to economic incentives or disincentives will be an action that maximizes expected utility.
  A, B, C, and D each describe actions taken in response to economic incentives or disincentives.
  E describes an impulsive crime, not a deliberate crime, and is not driven by economic incentives or disincentives.
  Therefore, E is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage defines the utility maximization principle as the idea that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The passage suggests that committing a crime is a rational economic decision if the expected utility from committing the crime, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  Therefore, the action that is least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one where the individual is not maximizing their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  Choice C describes an industrialist who continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant. The action taken by the industrialist is not maximizing their anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility as treating the pollutant would be more beneficial for them in the long run.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle explains that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to each outcome's likelihood, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, if someone acts in a way that doesn't follow this principle, then it can be considered the least appropriate response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option A describes a person who avoids taxes to maximize his income.
  Option B describes a person who avoids breaking the law to avoid being fined and losing his driver's license.
  Option C describes an industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into a river.
  Option D describes a government official risking prosecution for soliciting bribes to support herself and her family.
  Option E describes a worker physically assaulting his former supervisor.
  Option A, B, and D describe actions that follow the utility maximization principle.
  Option C describes an action where the illegal activity is cheaper than the legal alternative, but not whether the person is trying to maximize their overall satisfaction.
  Option E describes an impulsive crime committed as a response to being dismissed from a job, which is outside the scope of the utility maximization principle.
  Therefore, the answer is E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their expected satisfaction.
  The expected satisfaction is determined by weighing the possible outcomes of an action and adding up those weighted utilities.
  A rational response to economic incentives and disincentives will maximize the expected satisfaction.
  The answer should be a response that is not rational to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Choice A, B, C, and D all seem to be rational responses.
  However, choice E seems to be an impulsive crime of passion, which is not a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.

  The passage discusses the ways in which art was "produced by and for political and social elites".
  The author notes that there were two different ways this occurred historically.
  One way is commissioning artists to produce works that reflect the ideals and way of life of the elites. The other way is having a member of the elite engage a well-known artist to produce something for display, which reflects great credit on one's taste.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
  The sociohistorical critics must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them: to reflect and mirror their ideals and way of life or simply to demonstrate their good taste without consideration for artistic excellence. Moreover, the author suggests that sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.

The passage discusses the historical ways in which members of the elite commissioned art and the sociohistorical interpretation of this phenomenon. It presents two ways in which art was produced by and for political and social elites and explains how sociohistorical critics analyze this kind of art. The main point of the passage is that there were historically two ways in which members of the elite commissioned art, and that the sociohistorical interpretation of such art is complex and involves analyzing the relationship between the elite and the artists they commissioned. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the ways in which art was historically produced for members of the elite classes.
  It describes two different ways in which art was produced for the elite: commissioning famous artists, and creating works that expressed the patron's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin tend to prefer dealing with the latter type of art production, because it reflects the ideology of the elite.
  However, this kind of analysis has limitations, such as the possibility of artists subverting the patron's ideals.
  Furthermore, the taste of the elite classes has not always produced enduring art, and some artists had to seek eccentric patrons in the margins of the establishment.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to show that some art that went against the grain of elite values embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them and that sociohistorical analysis of this art must consider the limitations and complexities of this production.

  Sociohistorical interpretations of art are not entirely accurate; Taruskin's idea that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites, and that this art embodied the ideology of the elite, is flawed and overly simplistic.
  The taste of aristocracy and the upper middle class was not always apt to produce enduring art.
  As a result, more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment or produce art that went against the grain of elite values, which was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Because some of this art endured, sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  The main point of the passage is about the flaws in sociohistorical interpretations of art and the challenges of interpreting works of art as embodying the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes how art has historically been produced by and for the political and social elites.
  It highlights that there are two ways in which art was produced for the elites.
  It explains that sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way in order to analyze how it embodies the elites' ideology.
  It notes that the taste of the elites has not always resulted in art that endures.
  It suggests that some art that went against the elites' values endured and is analyzed by the sociohistorical critics in a Freudian way.
  The main point of the passage is to describe how art was produced by and for the political and social elites and how sociohistorical critics analyze such art.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how art was produced historically by and for political and social elites.
  There were two ways historically to produce art such that it was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  Historically, there were two social classes able to commission art, but the taste of these classes has not always produced art that endures.
  Sociohistorical critics have to analyze the way in which such art embodied the ideology of the elite, given that artists may subvert the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  The answer is about the main point of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)

Thought: 
  The author talks about how the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies has been limited, and presents a contrasting view of the traditional modes of autobiography that have not been studied.
  The author does not use any explicitly positive or negative language to describe the earlier scholarship.
  The phrase "have overlooked" (line 5) is critical, but it is offset by the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" which shows that the authors are working collaboratively with Native Americans.
  The phrase "failed to address" (line 9) is also critical, but it refers to the limited scope of the earlier studies, rather than an indictment of the scholarship itself.
  The rest of the choices describe elements of Native American culture, but do not relate to the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  Therefore, none of the choices accurately convey the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage compares traditional Native American autobiographical expressions with the European style of autobiography, and points out that most scholarship on Native American autobiographies has overlooked traditional forms of self-expression and the cultural constructs of Native American peoples.
  From the tone, the author seems critical of the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage because they have limited their studies to written documents produced by non-Native American collaborators.
  The author believes that the earlier scholars have failed to take into account the traditional pre-literate forms of self-expression among Native Americans, and their cultural perspectives about self, life, and writing.
  Examining the phrases mentioned in the answer choices,
  A: "failed to address" (line 9) implies that the scholars have overlooked something important but doesn't give a clear sense of the author's attitude.
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10) is a neutral description of Native American peoples.
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16) is a description of the idea of self in some pre-contact Native American cultures and doesn't directly relate to the author's attitude.
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24) is a neutral description that doesn't indicate the author's attitude.
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51) implies that the intercultural collaboration in Native American forms of expression may seem different from the European style of autobiography, but doesn't directly describe the author's attitude toward earlier scholarship.
  Therefore, the answer is not present in the choices.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author connects increased size with monopoly power, but states that a competitive marketplace is necessary for the invisible hand to work properly.
  The author implies that increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Therefore, an answer choice that suggests that there is no necessary connection between increased size and monopoly power would weaken the author's argument.
  Answer choice A regarding monopoly power in different regions is not relevant to the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice B is irrelevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice C supports the idea that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power, which is already stated by the author.
  Answer choice D may actually strengthen the idea that increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power because it implies that larger companies are more dominant in certain industries.
  Answer choice E may suggest that increasing returns to scale are not always beneficial but it doesn't necessarily undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the most relevant answer choice is D, which suggests that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies across industries and may not necessarily lead to monopoly power. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns tend to lead to monopoly, but the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry. 
  Therefore, if there exists a case where increasing returns don't lead to monopoly, then it would undermine the author's argument. 
  Choice (A) talks about some businesses with monopoly power, but it doesn't address the connection between size and monopoly power. 
  Choice (B) only addresses the issue of workers' salaries, which is not relevant to the discussion. 
  Choice (C) affirms the author's argument, stating that businesses collude to set prices when an industry is dominated by a few players. 
  Choice (D) introduces the idea that the size needed to achieve increasing returns varies widely, but it doesn't undermine the author's argument. 
  Choice (E) suggests that there are other factors that offset gains in productivity, which are different from the author's argument. 
  Therefore, the best answer is (A), which is not relevant to the author's argument. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author argues that bigger businesses are more efficient than smaller ones because they can achieve increasing returns to scale.
  However, increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Therefore, the author's argument depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The question asks which choice, if true, most undermines the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice B is also not relevant.
  Choice C supports the argument of the author.
  Choice D would undermine the assumption made by the author. If businesses can achieve increasing returns to scale at different sizes depending on the industry, then it is not necessarily that bigger businesses will automatically lead to monopoly power.
  Choice E does not undermine the author's argument, but it provides an alternative explanation for why increasing specialization may not lead to increased productivity.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale could lead to monopoly power, which is opposed to the idea of the invisible hand.
  Therefore, an answer that shows an exception to the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power would weaken the author's argument.
  Answer A talks about some industries where larger businesses do not exert monopoly power in certain regions, which does not contradict the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power.
  Answer B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer C strengthens the argument since it shows that larger businesses collude to achieve monopoly power.
  Answer D talks about the variation of the size needed to achieve increasing returns, which does not contradict the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power.
  Answer E shows that gains in productivity from increased specialization may not offset the costs, which is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question asks which statement, if true, would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power as described in the passage.
  The passage states that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, and that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until each industry is dominated by just a few players. 
  Therefore, any statement which shows that larger firms do not necessarily lead to monopoly power will undermine the author's argument. 
  Among the choices, only statement A talks about larger businesses not necessarily having monopoly power, while the other statements assume the connection between increased size and monopoly power. Hence, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find an answer choice that shows how increasing returns do not necessarily lead to monopoly.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant as it talks about monopoly power in one geographical region.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant as it talks about salaries, which are not directly related to the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  Answer choice C actually strengthens the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power as it talks about how businesses collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly.
  Answer choice D is plausible as it suggests that not all businesses can achieve increasing returns to scale to the same degree, and thus there may not be a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  Answer choice E is also plausible as it suggests that there are other factors that can offset productivity gains from increasing specialization.
  Between answer choices D and E, answer choice D is the most relevant to the author's argument as it directly addresses the issue of increasing returns to scale and their potential to lead to monopoly power.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author argues that the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand arises due to the inherent contradiction between increasing returns to scale and the tendency toward monopoly.
  The author assumes that increasing returns to scale lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few players in an industry.
  If there are other factors that prevent concentration of power despite increasing returns to scale, it would undermine the author's argument.
  Option A suggests that even though there are larger businesses in the industry, some businesses can still exert monopoly power in a particular geographical region. This implies that increasing returns to scale may not always lead to monopoly power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that there is a contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  One problem with increasing returns to scale is that they can lead to monopoly power.
  The Invisible Hand only works properly if there are many competitors in each industry.
  The author suggests that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory because increasing returns were hard to represent mathematically.
  Therefore, any answer that casts doubt on the link between size and monopoly power supports the author's argument.
  Answer A suggests that some large businesses cannot exert monopoly power, even when smaller businesses can.
  Answer B is unrelated to the link between size and monopoly power.
  Answer C reinforces the idea that larger firms can act like monopolies.
  Answer D suggests that the relationship between size and monopoly power is not straightforward.
  Answer E is unrelated to the link between size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage describes how increasing returns to scale lead to natural tendencies toward monopoly.
The author suggests that the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
Therefore, to undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly, there must be a statement that shows that increasing returns to scale do not lead to a natural tendency toward monopoly.
Action: Answer("D") 
Choice D suggests that the size that a business must reach in order to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. Since the relationship between increasing scale and monopoly power is dependent on the scale of the industry, this statement would undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author says that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power.
  If there is evidence that increased size does not always result in monopoly power, then it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option A suggests that there are larger businesses that do not have monopoly power, which would weaken the link between larger size and monopoly power.
  Options B, C, D, and E are not directly relevant to the issue of whether increasing returns to scale lead to monopoly power.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views
  C: art should be elevated above the portrayal of reality
  D: realism does not in fact facilitate the exposure of social inequities or contribute to the creation of a new society
  E: reality is not the crucial source of successful literature

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  There is no evidence in the passage that supports the claim that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases solely due to an increase in the rates of Mexican immigration or naturalization or the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States or assimilating into the culture of the United States.
  The passage does suggest that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large and variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the degree to which the views of the Mexican American Generation were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
  It notes that without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  The passage does not support any of the answer choices.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that it is not clear how far the Mexican American activists' outlook extended beyond them.
  The passage also mentions the importance of variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and the variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not support choice A because there is no evidence that an increase in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization leads to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage supports choice B because the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States led to the appearance of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active.
  The passage does not support choice C because there is no evidence that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States leads to a decrease in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage does not support choice D because there is no evidence that variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The passage supports choice E because it mentions the importance of variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization on ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Garcia's argument that a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960.
  These leaders were more acculturated and hence more politically active than their predecessors.
  Garcia's argument assumes that ethnic consciousness increased as a result of this new leadership.
  The passage counters this argument by stating that it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage also suggests that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, it is likely that the passage supports the statement that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The correct answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the degree to which the views of Mexican American activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population as a whole.
  The passage also mentions that without understanding important variables such as patterns and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared between 1930 and 1960 that were more politically active than their predecessors.
  It also discusses the variations in ethnic consciousness that occurred during this period.
  The passage does not provide evidence to support A or C.
  It is possible that B is true, but the passage does not provide direct evidence to support this statement.
  The passage does suggest that D and E could be true, but there is not enough information to say which one is more accurate.
  However, the passage specifically mentions "patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization," so E seems like a more appropriate answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  The passage suggests that this increase may have resulted in a new generation of political activists, who were more acculturated than their predecessors.
  However, the passage does not indicate that the increase automatically leads to an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  Rather, the passage suggests that there are many variables that may account for variations in ethnic consciousness, such as immigration and naturalization rates, patterns of ethnic consciousness, and the influence of Mexican American leaders.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans in relation to the influence of political activists during the period between 1930 and 1960.
The passage notes that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States may suggest an increase in ethnic Mexican population's political activism, but it cannot assume anything about ethnic consciousness.
Therefore, the answer is not B but can be E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses that the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound

  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought:
The author explains how digital publishing will eliminate the physical costs and expenses associated with publishing, including printing, selling, and distributing physical books, warehousing, displaying books in retail stores, and the cost of returning unsold books to publishers. 
The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to the direct costs associated with the physical aspects of publishing, specifically the costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books. 
Therefore, the correct answer is B: the price paid to have books printed and bound. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" is used to describe the costs that digital publication can eliminate.
  The author provides examples for these costs such as the cost of printing books, shipping them to wholesalers and retailers, display books in stores, and returning unsold books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to expenses that are irrelevant to digital publication.
  The author identifies some expenses that are eliminated in digital publishing such as the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  Therefore, choice D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books, seems to be the best option as it encompasses the expenses that are no longer necessary in digital publishing.
  Choice A, B, C, and E are not the best option, as they do not relate to the specific context in the paragraph.
Action: Answer("D")

  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to costs that are no longer relevant in digital publishing.
  The author talks about the elimination of warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books, and returning unsold books.
  These activities are associated with physical books and not digital publishing.
  Therefore, the categories of expense the author is referring to are the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to a group of expenses.
  The author mentions in the previous sentence about the elimination of the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers due to digital publishing.
  Therefore, the "whole categories of expense" primarily refers to the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  The answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author is discussing the cost saving of digital publishing over traditional publishing.
  Digital publishing eliminates several expenses like inventory, warehousing, shipping, retail display, and returns.
  These expenses are irrelevant to digital publication, which means they are whole categories of expense that are eliminated.
  Answer: B: the price paid to have books printed and bound.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: The phrase "whole categories of expense" refers to costs that would be eliminated by digital publishing.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification. It highlights the potential problems that may arise from such a power in the hands of unelected and unaccountable jurors.
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification. It presents scenarios where this power can be useful to correct what may have been an overzealous prosecution or point out problems with particular laws. 
  The two passages are most likely to disagree over whether the power of jury nullification is problematic or not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that juries should not have the power to nullify the law and that the consequences of nullification are great because juries are not like legislators who can revise the law publicly.
  Passage B argues that under certain circumstances, juries' nullification can be useful because it can signal to the legislature that there might be a problem with the law in question.
  The two passages disagree about whether nullification can be useful or not.
  Answer: D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against the use of the power of nullification by juries.
  Whereas, Passage B acknowledges the importance of the jury in situations where police and prosecutors may be overzealous in enforcing the law.
  The two authors may disagree on whether the jury's power of interpretation and discretion goes beyond its role of applying the law.
  The authors may also disagree on the extent of scrutiny and debate that is required in the creation of laws and the role of the jury in such debates.
  Therefore, the correct answer is either D or B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A focuses on the problems created by the jury's power to nullify, and argues that juries have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others and that juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful when applied in instances where a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction, and also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  Neither passage mentions anything about whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue, or whether it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are.
  Passage A explicitly mentions that jurors are not lawmakers, while Passage B suggests that juries can assist the legislature by indicating when a law may be problematic.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it. 
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The authors agree that jury nullification can perform a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature.
  They also both express concerns about the use of jury nullification.
  The authors of Passage A believe that juries are not legislators and have no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others.
  The authors of Passage B believe that when a jury nullifies, it can use its own discretion to decide that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction.
  The authors would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that jury nullification has the potential for problems because:
  1- The power is used in unknown ways
  2- Jurors may not have enough information to make reasoned nullification decisions
  3- Jurors are not legislators and have no obligation to think through the effect of an acquittal on others.
  Passage B suggests that jury nullification can be useful when:
  1- Police and prosecutors are overzealous
  2- The law is too broad or not well defined
  3- The law is seen as unjust.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would most likely disagree over whether juries have the right to interpret the law. Passage A suggests that jurors are not legislators and should only consider the technical question of guilt or innocence. Passage B suggests that juries can decide whether a case is too trivial, circumstances too extenuating, or a law unjust. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A opposes the power of juries to nullify.
  Passage B supports the power of juries to nullify.
  Options A, B, and E are not directly related to the disagreement between the passages.
  Option C is not discussed in either passage.
  Option D is in direct opposition to Passage A.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and the problems related to it.
  Passage B talks about how the jury can act as a safety valve and perform a useful function.
  The authors of the passages seem to have different perspectives on the role of the jury and its power to interpret the law.
  Passage A argues against jury nullification, while Passage B sees it as useful in some cases.
  The authors do not seem to disagree about choices A, B, C, or E.
  The disagreement appears to be over whether juries have the power to interpret the law.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The two passages focus on the use and impact of jury nullification, in which the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact.
  Passage A is more skeptical about the use of jury nullification and argues that juries nullifying a verdict poses problems because of the lack of transparency, insufficient evidence, and the fact that juries are not legislators.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be a useful function if it is compelling enough to warrant all twelve jurors to agree with it, and it can assist and signal to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  The passages do not address whether elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are.
  The passages also do not talk about whether laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people. 
  Passage A and B have different opinions on whether juries should have the power to interpret the law, with Passage A arguing that this is not juries it's purview while Passage B argues that it can be a useful function.
  As for E, Passage B argues that juries can serve as a safety valve when police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A presents potential problems created by the jury's power of nullification.
  Passage B presents potential benefits and usefulness of the jury's power of nullification.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration
  D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
  E: Some of the refrigerant chemicals being manufactured today contain chemicals known to be environmentally damaging.
Response 0:

  The passage is about the effects of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  The Montreal Protocol of 1987 was developed to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s.
  The passage does not discuss the discovery of refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs.
  Therefore, statements A, B, and E are not strongly supported by the information in the passage.
  The passage does not discuss the energy efficiency of refrigeration components.
  Therefore, statement C is not strongly supported by the information in the passage.
  The correct statement is that the Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the work of Molina and Rowland on the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs.
  The passage does not provide extensive information about refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs.
  While the passage states that more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals were developed after the ban on CFCs, it does not provide information on how they compare to CFCs in terms of the number of chlorine atoms released.
  The passage does not discuss the energy efficiency of CFCs.
  The passage states that CFCs were banned in North America in the late 1970s, but it was the Montreal Protocol of 1987 that led to an international agreement to ban their production.
  The passage does not discuss refrigerant chemicals being produced today.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the information in the passage is that D: The Montreal Protocol led to the cessation of CFC production in North America.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  A is not correct because the passage gives no indication that any refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs existed when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B is supported by the passage because the last part states that the banning of CFCs led to the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
  C is not supported by the passage because it does not mention anything about the use of CFCs in refrigeration components being energy-efficient.
  D is only partially correct; the passage notes that CFCs were banned in North America late in the 1970s, but the Montreal Protocol led to an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  E is not supported by the passage because the passage does not discuss the manufacturing of refrigerant chemicals containing environmentally damaging substances.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The author argues that patenting biotechnology inventions will not hinder basic research, but rather, will spur it because patents provide scientific innovators with a compelling incentive.

The author argues that researchers who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. The author suggests that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries. 
  The author also suggests that patent rights would not be an effective way to deny access to basic research.
  Therefore, the author would agree with statement C, "The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The author acknowledges the concerns of some researchers that patenting biological materials could lead to restrictions on access to research materials, hindering basic research. However, the author also argues that patents actually provide scientists with incentives to innovate, and that there is a tradition of respecting noncommercial research exceptions to patent infringement.
Choice A is incorrect, as the passage does not mention why early researchers freely shared research materials.
Choice B is incorrect, as the passage argues that it is questionable whether patent holders would charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research.
Choice C is correct, as the passage states that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and that judges have traditionally respected a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
Choice D is incorrect, as the passage only mentions that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share the view that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential.
Choice E is incorrect, as the passage makes no mention of the innovative capacity of scientists who oppose patenting biotechnology.

The author may be most likely to agree with C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author argues that the perceived threat to basic research is restrictions on access to research materials, not patent rights.
  The author claims that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access.
  The author mentions that judges have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  The author suggests that patents provide compelling incentives to innovate.
  Based on these reasons, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that "The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials."

  The author argues that patent rights are not equivalent to control of access to biological materials.
  The author also notes that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Additionally, the author believes that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Based on the passage, the information yielded by which one of the following experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer?
Choices:
  A: testing to see whether the chemical is capable of reacting with forms of oxygen other than ozone
  B: testing to see whether the chemical,when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there
  C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine
  D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine
  E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question is asking for information about a potential replacement for CFCs that would not damage the ozone layer as CFCs do.
  The passage provides information that CFCs, when released into the lower atmosphere, slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere, and then subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine.
  CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Therefore, testing to determine whether a potential replacement for CFCs would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful in determining whether the replacement could damage the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment will help to determine if a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs deplete the ozone layer through chemical reactions.
  Therefore, we need to test whether the chemical will react with ozone or not.
  Choice A does not help in determining whether a chemical will harm the ozone layer or not, just whether it can react with other forms of oxygen.
  Choice B is not relevant to the question at hand. We are not worried about other reactions in the lower atmosphere, only the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Choice C is relevant to our question. If the new chemical reacts with chlorine, then it could harm the ozone layer.
  Choice D is not useful because it does not tell us about the chemical's interaction with ozone specifically.
  Choice E is not specific to the impact on the ozone layer; it only tells us whether the chemical undergoes breakdown when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage implies that CFCs negatively affect the ozone layer by breaking down and releasing chlorine into the stratosphere.
  Therefore, a chemical that could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer should not break down into chlorine.
  Choice (C) proposes testing the chemical to determine whether it would react with chlorine.
  If the chemical does not react with chlorine, it would not release chlorine into the atmosphere and would be a good candidate for replacing CFCs.
  Therefore, Choice (C) is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks which one of the experiments would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage states that the destruction of the ozone layer is caused by the chemical reaction of CFCs with the ozone layer which releases chlorine atoms.
  It is important to find a chemical that doesn't react with chlorine and doesn't cause any harm to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, it is critical to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, as mentioned in option C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for an experiment that would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage talks about how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer and how this leads to the destruction of the ozone and regeneration of chlorine.
  Therefore, an experiment that tests whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful one in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs damage the ozone layer by releasing chlorine atoms when exposed to ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere, causing a chemical reaction that destroys ozone molecules.
  Thus, a useful experiment would have to test whether a new chemical would undergo this kind of reaction and release chlorine atoms into the stratosphere.
  From the given choices, the most relevant experiment would be testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine, Choice C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that CFCs react chemically with ozone and deplete it causing harm to the ozone layer.
  It also mentions that, when exposed to massive ultraviolet radiation, CFCs break down into their constituent elements including chlorine.
  Chlorine is harmful to the ozone layer and chemically reacts with ozone in a way that destroys it.
  Therefore, to determine whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, it is most useful to test the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the harmful effect of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  The experiment that would be most useful is the one that would determine if a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Based on the passage, such a chemical should not react with chlorine, as CFCs react with chlorine to damage the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the experiment that tests the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine would be the most useful in determining whether a chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
The passage mentions that CFCs are highly volatile chemicals and that, when released into the lower atmosphere, they slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. 
When CFCs are subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down, releasing chlorine which is devastating to the ozone layer. Therefore, we need a chemical that will not break down into constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
We need to test whether the chemical replacement for CFCs would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Therefore, the answer is E: testing the chemical to see if it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage has explained how CFCs break down into their constituent elements when subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation and how the increase of chlorine atoms in the stratosphere is harmful to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the experiment that tests whether the chemical would chemically react with chlorine, similar to the way CFCs do, would be the most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could be a suitable replacement for CFCs.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the attempt to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary premises, but the prediction was incorrect.
  One hypothesis for the failure of the prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary premises, especially the assumption that there were no other planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  The astronomers changed the assumption and hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Therefore, Neptune is an auxiliary premise that caused a disturbing force on the prediction made based on Newton's laws and other auxiliary premises, which was later corrected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  In Passage A (line 26), the author mentions that "auxiliary premises" or assumptions by scientists "appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc." 
  In Passage B, the prediction of Uranus's orbit was based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun, other planets' masses, orbits, and velocities, and the non-existence of planets in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found the orbit they predicted was incorrect, and had to change their assumptions about the existence of other planets to conclude that there might be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. 
  Therefore, the question is asking about which of these answer choices illustrates a disturbing force. Uranus, the sun, Neptune, and Mercury are all celestial bodies in the solar system, while the moon is Earth's natural satellite. 
  Choice A, Uranus, is the planet for which scientists were attempting to predict its orbit. The auxiliary assumptions scientists made initially did not consider the possibility of the planets near Uranus affecting its orbit. 
  Choice B, the sun, is one of the auxiliary assumptions scientists considered when they first predicted Uranus's orbit. 
  Choice C, Neptune, is discovered by scientists after they adjusted their assumptions about the existence of other planets close to Uranus. 
  Choice D, Mercury, is the planet for which scientists made a new prediction based on Newton's laws. 
  Choice E, the moon, is not a factor in this context.
  Thus, Uranus is the answer since the prediction of its orbit was based on auxiliary premises or assumptions, which did not consider the possibility of other planets near Uranus affecting its orbit, and this is the example of a disturbing force in the context. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question refers to a definition provided in Passage A that "when scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc."
  Passage B discusses a failed attempt by astronomers to predict the orbital path of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions and Newton's laws.
  They discovered that their predictions were incorrect, and they changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, which was an auxiliary assumption.
  The discovery of Neptune helped bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the answer could be a planet or another celestial body that could have influenced Uranus's orbit. 
Action: Answer("E") 
E: the moon - The gravitational pull of the moon could be seen as a disturbing force (auxiliary premise) that could have influenced Uranus's orbit.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  In passage A, the definition of a disturbing force is not given, but it appears to be a factor that interferes with the correct functioning of instrumentation, or assumption used in a scientific study.
  In passage B, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus, but their predictions were incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is an auxiliary assumption that interferes with the correct functioning of instrumentation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The relevant information to answer this question is given in passage A, specifically in the context of Popper's use of the logical asymmetry to describe the actual situation scientists face.
  According to this context, the answer must describe an additional "auxiliary" premise that scientists typically need when they derive a theory's predictions, which may lead to the failure of that prediction.
  The only option that refers to an additional force is option E: the moon. The gravitational pull of the moon could be considered a disturbing force (an additional premise) that affects the orbit of Mercury, for example. 
  Therefore, the answer is E: the moon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  In passage A, "disturbing forces" are one of the "auxiliary" premises that scientists need to consider.
  In passage B, one of the auxiliary assumptions when predicting the orbit of Uranus was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  Later astronomers discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Neptune is the most likely choice that illustrates a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The question refers to a term introduced in Passage A: "disturbing forces."
  Passage A explains that "auxiliary premises" can appeal to "the absence of disturbing forces."
  Passage B describes a situation where the predictions of astronomers based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions were not borne out.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan, but it was never found.
  Therefore, the answer must refer to something that was not accounted for in the auxiliary premises.
  The only choice that fits this description is E, the moon, which is a well-known source of gravitational disturbance in the solar system.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A defines the term 'disturbing force'.
  In Passage B, auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets are mentioned.
  These auxiliary assumptions can be considered as examples of disturbing forces.
  There is no mention of 'disturbing forces' in Passage B apart from these auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, B: the sun, C: Neptune, D: Mercury, and E: the moon are irrelevant to the question.
  The answer should be related to the auxiliary assumptions.
  A: Uranus was not an auxiliary assumption. Uranus is the planet whose orbit was predicted incorrectly.
  Since the only mentioned example of a disturbing force is the auxiliary assumptions, the answer should address them.
  Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  In passage A, the author mentions "additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces" in line 25-27.
  In passage B, the author mentions the existence of "another planet in the vicinity" as an auxiliary assumption that led to the discovery of Neptune in line 46-47. 
  Therefore, in passage B, the auxiliary assumption of the presence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus is an example of a disturbing force as described in passage A.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  In passage A, "auxiliary premises" can include "disturbing forces".
  In passage B, the astronomers made some auxiliary assumptions about the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets, and one of their assumptions was that there was no planet in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, when the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  The failure of their prediction could be caused by either an error in the auxiliary assumptions, or by Newton's laws being incorrect (passage B).
  Since the astronomers had to change their assumptions about the existence of other planets, their previous assumption, which was no planet existed in the vicinity of Uranus, must have been false.
  Thus, the cause for the failure of their prediction was not the mass, orbit, or velocity of other planets, but the actual existence of other planets in the vicinity that they had not taken into account.
  Therefore, "other planets" are the disturbing force, and the answer is none of the above.

Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a third position between two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.

  The other position maintained that literature should be useful by finding its sources in concrete reality, which is also not consistent with Dostoyevsky's beliefs.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source but it cannot be depicted "as it is."
  He also believed that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thought:
  "Capricious enforcement" refers to enforcement that is irregular or unpredictable.
  The passage suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight helps ensure that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A defines discretionary nonenforcement as a technique that could be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion while avoiding underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is likely to involve not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is defined as enforcement that is unpredictable because decisions are made arbitrarily, rather than according to a consistent principle or rule.
  The passage suggests that there are rules of discretion involved in deciding how/when to enforce laws and that these rules are in a sense mandated by the costs of precise enforcement.
  The passage suggests that capricious enforcement is generally avoidable because "legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced."
  Therefore, the answer should not involve enforcing laws based on the intent of the decision-maker, but rather the inconsistency or unpredictability of those decisions.
  Based on these thoughts, the best answer is A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses discretionary nonenforcement as a technique used by law enforcement agencies.
  The agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule.
  Capricious enforcement is not unknown, but it does not appear to be the central tendency since the legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is not a frequent tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement is defined as irregular or unpredictable enforcement of the law.
  The passage suggests that the legislative oversight ensures that law enforcement agencies do not stray from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is unlikely to be central in nature.
  Therefore, it is unlikely to prioritize enforcement according to damage caused by the crimes or enforce only to the degree that municipal resources make it possible.
  The answer seems to be D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the discretionary nonenforcement technique that helps reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  The passage also suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement disregards the legislature's oversight and the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, answer E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law is the best fit for the concept of capricious enforcement.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement is mentioned in Passage A.
  The passage argues against the danger of punishing an innocent person.
  The passage argues that discretionary nonenforcement can be used to reduce the costs of overinclusion without an increase in underinclusion (loopholes).
  Capricious enforcement does not appear to be the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Capricious enforcement implies not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement refers to an arbitrary and unpredictable method of law enforcement.
  The passage argues in favor of discretionary nonenforcement, as a technique to reduce the costs of overinclusion.
  The central tendency, as supported by legislative oversight, is for the law enforcement agency to not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Capricious means unpredictable and arbitrary.
  Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency.
  Legislative oversight ensures that enforcement is close enough to the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement does not involve prioritizing enforcement according to the legislature's intent.
  Enforcement only to the degree that municipal resources make possible is not capricious enforcement.
  Not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law is another matter.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought: 
Regarding the crime deterrence debate, legal scholars are using the utility maximization principle, which suggests that a person commits a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
The use of this economic principle provides a framework for analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
The principle analyzes the rational response of economic incentives or disincentives, much like an economist would analyze a situation.
Among the recommendations on both sides of the crime deterrence debate, the utility maximization principle has the same overall effect.
Therefore, based on the passage, the use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is most similar to an economist's use of an economic principle to analyze a situation.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle as a way to analyze decisions about committing a crime.
  Based on this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  According to the utility maximization principle, a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The passage explains that the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect by affecting the utility equation.
  The economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Thus, legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is an attempt to reconcile the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  None of the other scenarios described in the choices are similar to the use of the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to reconcile the two positions on crime deterrence.
  The utility maximization principle is based on determining the expected utility of an action.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  This rational economic choice method can also be used to analyze the decision to commit a crime.
  The two crime-deterrence methods (changing societal norms/institutions and strengthening law enforcement/increasing penalties), far from being antithetical, are complementary because they both affect the utility equation.
  The optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.  
  Therefore, legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze the decision to commit a crime and determine the optimal approach to crime deterrence.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage introduces the utility maximization principle to reconcile two opposing views on crime deterrence.
  According to the utility maximization principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The principle implies that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  The principle shows that to deter crimes, the expected cost of committing a crime should be greater than the expected benefit.
  This approach to deter crimes is based on rational economic analysis, which involves weighing the benefits of a decision against the costs.
 Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the scenario most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle.
  The principle holds that a decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  People are more likely to choose lawful activity if expected utility from it increases.
  This use of economic incentives is similar to one side of the debate regarding crime deterrence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle as a way to analyze an individual's rational economic choice of committing a crime.
  The principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  Within this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The passage indicates that both sides of the crime deterrence debate have the same overall effect.
  Increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity and increasing economic opportunities both affect the utility equation.
  Therefore, legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is similar to the use of an economic principle to demonstrate how two seemingly contradictory positions can be reconciled.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle.
  The principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.

  The passage also explains how the two sides of the crime deterrence debate are not fundamentally in conflict.
  The optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Based on this, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is the one that involves using one theory or principle from one field to explain another phenomenon in another field.
Action: Answer('D')
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how the utility maximization principle reconciles the two positions of the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle is used to demonstrate that the two positions result in the same overall effect.
  The economic framework is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the scenario most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle is one where a principle from one field of study is used to inform a debate in a separate field of study.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage presents the utility maximization principle as a solution that reconciles two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The utility maximization principle can be used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle involves determining the expected utility of an action by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action according to their likelihood.
  The expected utility of criminal activity can be reduced by strengthening law enforcement and increasing penalties, while the expected utility of lawful activity can be increased by increasing economic opportunities.
  The use of the utility maximization principle is presented as a way to combine elements of both deterrence strategies.
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate is a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of the utility maximization principle in reconciling two seemingly opposing views on the deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  The principle allows for the analysis of a person's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The two sides of the crime-deterrence debate suggest different methods for reducing criminal activity: changing societal norms, institutions, and rehabilitating criminals versus increasing fines, penalties, and law enforcement.
  Both methods have the effect of influencing an individual's expected utility from criminal activity, thereby reducing the likelihood of crime.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that the two positions are complementary, rather than antithetical.
  None of the answer choices directly parallel this situation.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The physicists involved in the experiments were not even receptive to the possibility of splitting the atoms.
  The products of the experiments remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  The right conceptual link was the missing piece.
  Thus, if the physicists had not been skeptical about the possibility of splitting atoms, that may have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
Atoms were being split without the recognition of the researchers.
Previously, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
Physicists were not even receptive to the possibility of splitting of atoms when they were conducting experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
The products remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
It was Lise Meitner, who recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
Based on the given information, if the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms, it would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that nuclear fission was achieved without scientists realizing what they were witnessing.
  The products of fission were not identified partly because researchers expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Lise Meitner, who recognized the significance of the data related to underlying theoretical considerations, helped to discover nuclear fission.
  To reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, the researchers would have needed to have different expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage explains that it took physicists some time to realize that atoms were being split because they lacked the right conceptual link.
  Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the best way to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split could be by providing them with the right conceptual link. 
  Choice B, which states that the physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, could provide the right conceptual link.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that scientists were compiling evidence of nuclear fission before recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split was a major revision of theory.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that nuclear fission might happen in their experiments. 
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection between the experiments and the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, an option that suggests that physicists were more aware of the underlying theoretical considerations, or more aware of the possibility of splitting atoms, would be most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, physicists were compiling increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved before they recognized what they were witnessing.
  Physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible in principle to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
  Therefore, Answer (B) "The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products" is most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split, because researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. If they had not had any particular expectations, they might have realized what was happening sooner. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage mentions that the physicists had increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved but did not recognize what they were witnessing. 
The passage also mentions that the products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced. 
The author also notes that Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
Therefore, the most likely answer to the question is the one that highlights the obstacles or barriers that physicists faced in recognizing the evidence that was present, but not fully understood.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that between 1934 and 1939 physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission was achieved, without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
  The products produced by neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  One of the substances resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element that would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism envisioned.
  Meitner was the one who recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, it is most likely that if the physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium, then they would have realized that atoms were being split earlier.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how physicists discovered a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split.
  Scientists compiled evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without realizing what they were witnessing.
  Physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Therefore, if physicists conducted experiments with a substance other than uranium, it may have reduced the amount of time it took them to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that the physicists were not receptive to the possibility of atoms being split in the context of their experiments.
  The discovery of nuclear fission had crucial theoretical implications that scientists overlooked because they lacked the necessary conceptual link.
  Therefore, to reduce the amount of time it took for the physicists to realize that atoms were being split, they needed to have certain expectations and knowledge.
  Choice A is not relevant to the problem.
  Choice D is not likely to help the physicists realize that atoms were being split.
  Choice E does not explain any action that would have reduced the amount of time it took for the physicists to realize that atoms were being split.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.

Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three positions regarding Russian literary criticism during Dostoyevsky's time.
  The first position was that art stood high above the present and the everyday.
  The second position was that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, taken by Dostoyevsky, was that reality was literature's crucial source but reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  The passage shows how Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality differed from the prevailing view among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the utilitarian claim that art must serve a particular political view was the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny."
  He also defined "artistic" as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.
  The passage does not explicitly state that the third position is superior or inferior to the first two, but it does differentiate the third position in detail from the first two.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage B criticizes the idea that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  The author thinks that there are other factors that can explain a given behavior besides the proliferation of genes.
  The author of passage A suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  This idea exemplifies the idea criticized in passage B that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory that explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  The author of Passage A, explains that a given type of human behavior can be explained by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, in order to explain the proliferation of the genetic material causing that behavior.
  The assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies what the author of Passage B means when they call evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  In passage B, the author claims that evolutionary psychology is a "conspiracy theory" since it explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  The author of passage A argues that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. That is, apparently unselfish actions can actually promote the replication of genes.
  Therefore, the assertion that seems to most clearly exemplify what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  The author thinks that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The author also thinks that such arguments can appear persuasive but are rare and need to be handled with great care.
  From passage A, the assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
  This is because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves) that the individual does not openly acknowledge.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The term "conspiracy theory" implies that evolutionary psychology attributes motives or interests to individuals that they are not aware of.
  Passage B argues that evolutionary psychology is suspect because behaviors can be motivated by many possible interests.
  Passage B does not provide specific criticism of any assertion in passage A.
  However, passage A attributes interests to genes rather than to individuals, but this assertion does not satisfy the definition of "conspiracy theory."
  The most likely answer is B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology, because this assertion implies that evolutionary psychology seeks to explain complex behavior through simple interests. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory".
  The author of passage B asserts that evolutionary psychology imputes an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  Such interests might be inferred to be the "proliferation of genes".
  Passage A provides an example of this assertion by arguing that genes promoting their self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A defines evolutionary psychology as analyzing human behavior from the perspective of the theory of evolution.
  Passage B calls this a conspiracy theory because it tries to explain behavior based on interests that are not transparent or acknowledged by the individual exhibiting the behavior.
  The best example of this from Passage A is the assertion that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an assertion from Passage A that exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory."
  Passage B refers to evolutionary psychology as a "conspiracy theory" because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of.
  Based on this, the assertion from Passage A that exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is the one that explains how genes promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage B claims that evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory.
  It claims that evolutionary psychologists ascribe a hidden interest to individual behavior.
  So the author of passage B is critical of evolutionary psychologists.
  The mention of this hidden interest means that it is probably an aspect of some answer choice in passsage A that the author of passage B is critical of.
  The answer choice that mentions an aspect of genetic self-propagation through unselfish actions seems to be the best candidate for the author's criticism.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author of passage A explains how evolutionary psychology examines human behavior to explain its contribution to reproductive success and proliferation of genetic material.
  The author of passage B believes that evolutionary psychology is like a conspiracy theory that explains behavior through an interest in the proliferation of genes that the agent does not acknowledge.
  The author of passage B thinks that most behaviors can be explained by multiple interests.
  To identify which assertion from passage A most clearly exemplifies the belief of the author of passage B, we need to find an assertion that explains behavior through an interest in proliferation of genes.
  D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" most clearly exemplifies the view of the author of passage B by indicating how evolutionary psychology explains behavior as a way for genes to propagate themselves.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used to describe as-told-to life histories.
  These life histories are solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The term "composite" implies that there are multiple contributors to the finished product.
  The collaborators come from a different culture than the Native American autobiographer.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to an autobiography that was originally told by a Native American but was written down and edited by non-Native Americans.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of life history.
  The life history is "as-told-to."
  Non-Native American collaborators solicited, translated, recorded, and edited the life history.
  The author of the life history is a Native American.
  Therefore, bicultural composite authorship refers to a Native American's life history which was solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  Choice D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture best represents the meaning of the phrase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of life history.
  This type of life history is written by non-Native American collaborators.
  Scholarly work that focuses on this type of life history has overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history among Native Americans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is used in line 5 to describe the process by which most life histories of Native Americans were created.
  The passage explains that such written documents were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  The term "composite" suggests that the finished product is a combination of different elements.
  The term "bicultural" suggests that these different elements come from two distinct cultures, Native American and European.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" means that the finished product of most life histories of Native Americans is a combination of elements from Native American and European cultures, as created by non-Native American collaborators.
  The closest meaning to this is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a specific type of life history that scholars have focused on. 
  The passage describes how these life histories are "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators". 
  The passage also suggests that these life histories are created through a collaborative process that involves both Native American and non-Native American individuals. 
  Therefore, the best answer would be D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of literature.
  The literature is about the autobiographies of Native Americans.
  The literature was created by non-Native American collaborators.
  This type of literature was not created by Native Americans alone.
  Therefore, the literature was created by a collaboration of two cultures.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the autobiographies of Native Americans that were studied by scholars.
  These scholars have focused on written documents that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship".
  The author mentions that these scholars overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  The author also explains that the idea of self was more inclusive in the Native American cultures.
  The author gives examples of traditional modes of autobiographical expressions among early Native Americans.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" in line 5 means that the written documents were edited, recorded, and translated by non-Native American collaborators who worked with Native American authors. The finished products were a result of collaboration between members of different cultures.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  According to the passage:
  - Most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  - These life histories emerged from "bicultural composite authorship".
  - These scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history.
  So, the bicultural composite authorship refers to a collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators for producing life histories.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" referring to "as-told-to life histories".
  2 cultures are involved in the authorship: Native American (storyteller) and non-Native American (listener).
  The phrase describes a method of creating a written autobiography where the storyteller speaks and the non-Native American records and edits it.
  The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to show how relative wealth affects happiness, and how people compare themselves to others in their reference group.
  The authors of passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to argue that earning more makes people happier because it provides a sense of success and value creation.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A mention the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, while the authors of passage B mention the study to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A describes how people compare their income with some norm and how this norm rises along with actual income. Solnick and Hemenway's study supports this idea by showing that people prefer to earn less if they are in a better relative position. The passage uses this study to provide evidence for this explanation of a phenomenon.
  Passage B discusses a different explanation for why earning more makes people happier. The passage mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to present a view against the idea that people care most about one-upmanship. 
  Therefore, the authors of the two passages mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different reasons.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes how people's happiness is affected by wealth and the phenomenon of rivalry.
  Passage B provides an alternate explanation for why earning more makes people happier.
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for the phenomenon of rivalry influencing happiness.
  Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to argue against the notion that wanting to have more than others is an ignoble tendency.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to present a view that will be argued against, respectively.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The authors of passage A and passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway but for different reasons.
  The authors of passage A mention the study to give evidence of how rivalry plays a role in happiness.
  The authors of passage B mention the study to argue against the idea that one-upmanship is the main reason for caring most about relative prosperity.
  Therefore, Passage A mentions the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, and Passage B mentions the same study to argue against a view. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is cited to show that people compare income with some norm; people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves; and people compare themselves with their "reference group" to achieve happiness.
  In Passage B, the study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned to support that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway.
  I need to determine why they mentioned this study.
  The purpose of mentioning this study in Passage A is to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  The purpose of mentioning this study in Passage B is to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  Therefore, the answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The study by Solnick and Hemenway was mentioned in passage A and passage B.
  We need to check the description of the purpose of mentioning the study for each passage.
  From passage A, the study was used to support the idea of people comparing their income with some norm, which must be rising along with actual income.
  From passage B, the study was mentioned to counter the idea that we care most about one-upmanship.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses research that suggests people's happiness depends on how their income compares to that of their peers.
  Passage B presents a different explanation for why people may be happier with a higher income.
  The study by Solnick and Hemenway is mentioned in both passages to support or refute different interpretations of how income relates to happiness.
  Therefore, passage A uses the study to provide evidence for the view that people value relative prosperity over absolute income.
  Passage B uses the study to present a view that will be argued against: that people care most about one-upmanship.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  In passage A, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to support the idea that relative prosperity is more important for happiness than money itself.
  In passage B, the Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned to provide evidence for the explanation that earning more makes people happier because they feel they have created value.
  Therefore, the authors of passage A and passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon and to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, respectively.
  The answer is C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon. 
Action: Answer("C")

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise

Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

	Thus, the answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage suggests that biotechnology patents might hinder basic research.
Some researchers oppose biotechnology patents because they fear that patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials or refuse to make such materials available to scientists.
The author argues that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access, and a completely noncommercial research exception exists to patent infringement.
Therefore, the author would probably predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that some researchers fear that the patent holder will prevent further research.
  The passage also mentions that granting a patent does not imply granting the right to deny access to the patented materials.
  The passage further states that judges deciding patent cases have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the perceived threat to basic research regarding restrictions on access to biological materials arising from enforcement of a patent right or through the operation of a contractual agreement.
  The author argues that scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials.
  The author believes that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The author states that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the researcher may conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation without permission, and has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement.
  The answer is D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage mentions that the fears of academic researchers over the patenting of biological materials are caused by restrictions on access to research materials and the possibility that the patent holder will refuse to make these materials available to researchers working on basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. It also mentions that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher conducting basic and noncommercial research is questionable, and that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Therefore, the researcher in question will have a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage states that some biotechnology researchers fear that patent holders will refuse to make patented biological materials available to researchers unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. However, the author argues that the researcher's fear is misplaced. Whether a patent will be enforced against a researcher is questionable, and there has been a tradition among judges that completely noncommercial research is an exception to patent infringement. The passage also suggests that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Therefore, the author would most likely predict that the researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage states that a patent does not imply the right to deny access to the biological material.
  The passage also mentions that researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research may not be subject to patent infringement.
  Therefore, if a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation, the researcher likely has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The article argues that researchers who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage points out that the subtractive method produces images of localized brain functions that seem to support the modular theory of mind.

  Option B is consistent with the argument that mental processes are not modular and that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it is interpreted.
The author critiques the use of the subtractive method in general because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
The author does not mention invalidity of results for medical applications, support for Uttal's view, or proof that emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
However, the author does note that the subtractive method creates an illusion of localized brain functions, which supports the modular theory of mind.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the subtractive method as a way to produce images of the brain at work.
  However, the method has been criticized for masking distributed brain functions and giving a false impression of neat functional localization.

  Therefore, the answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author discusses the subtractive method and the images it produces.
  The author argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and therefore creates an illusion of neat functional localization.
  The author does not state that the method is invalid or mistaken, only that it may not fully support the modular theory of mind.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with choice D, that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author explains the subtractive method as a way of seeing which brain areas light up in response to various cognitive tasks, but this is not equivalent to localized brain regions for distinct entities.
  The whole brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions, and the subtractive method fits the modular theory of mind poorly.
  The author suggests that the subtractive method may produce misleading images of the brain at work.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage is discussing the value and validity of using neuroimaging in psychology as a method to analyze different components of the mind.
  The author critiques the modular theory of mind which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules in localized brain regions.
  The author argues that mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules, but rather properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage explains that the FMRI subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The passage does not provide support for option A, B, D, or E.
  However, the passage directly supports option C, which states that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active will show a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and how it differs from their use in medical diagnosis.
The premise of using neuroimaging in psychology depends on the modular theory of mind, which suggests that distinct brain regions correspond to distinct mental processes.
The passage argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid because mental processes may be distributed throughout the brain, rather than limited to specific regions.
The passage also notes that the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to measure metabolic activity during cognitive tasks does not account for the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that "The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times," which is option D. The passage notes that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that the subtractive method used in FMRI obscures this fact. It does not suggest that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans to study the mind and the modular theory of mind.
  The passage explains that the modular theory of mind may not be accurate because mental activities are not decomposable into independent modules but rather distributed throughout the brain.

  Choice C states that during performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This is supported by the passage, which explains that FMRI depicts the differential rate of oxygen use between the control condition and the on-task condition. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses neuroimaging as a method of localizing cognitive functions, and critiques the modular theory of mind as being overly simplistic and reductionist.
  Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) uses a subtractive method to show differential brain activity during cognitive tasks.
  The subtractive method is problematic because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage does not mention anything that strongly supports choices A, B, D, or E.
  Choice C is supported by the passage because it describes the process of FMRI as a way to differentiate metabolic activity between regions of the brain during cognitive tasks.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The passage explains that the use of brain scans, especially in psychology, is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise compared to its use in medical diagnosis.
The modular theory of mind, which underpins the use of neuroimaging in psychology, may be flawed and inaccurate as it assumes mental activity can be broken down into independent modules instantiated in localized brain regions.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces striking images of the brain at work, but the whole brain is active in both conditions and produces a false impression of neat functional localization.
The passage does not support A, B, D, or E.
Option C is accurate, as the passage mentions that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage discusses the value of neuroimaging in psychology and argues against the premise of the modular theory of mind that mental activity can be decomposed into independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. It also explains the subtractive method of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it is used to account for the fact that brain scans do in fact reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks. The passage emphasizes the problem with the subtractive method's interpretation and the neural localization it represents.
Statement:
From the passage, the statement most strongly supported is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The passage discusses the use of brain scans and how it relates to the modular theory of mind. 
The FMRI brain scan technique relies on a subtractive method where the cognitive task is subtracted from a control condition.
The entire brain is active in both conditions, and it is false to assume that functional localization is neat.
Regions of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than the rest of the brain, but the entire brain is still active.
The modular theory of mind posits that independent modules located in specific regions of the brain house cognition.
The passage does not support option A, as it argues against the modularity of the brain. 
Option B is incorrect because the passage does not discuss whether regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero. 
Option D is incorrect because the baseline measurements are not used to show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anger specifically. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the validity of the modular theory of the mind as applied to neuroimaging in psychology.
  The passage explains that, according to psychologist William Uttal, mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain, rather than distinct modules.
  The passage also describes how the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Thus, the most strongly supported statement is that the modular theory of mind as applied to neuroimaging in psychology is not completely valid, because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the difference between the use of brain scans in medical diagnosis and in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions, but this theory may not be valid since mental processes could be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Brain scans are used to map the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and FMRI reveals the differential rate of oxygen use between the control condition and while the subject is performing some cognitive task. This method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The passage indicates that the modular theory of mind cannot account for the fact that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  Therefore, the statement that most strongly supported by the passage is that the modular theory of mind cannot account for the fact that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that "light up" in response to various cognitive tasks. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage explains how the use of brain scans may not support the modular theory of mind. The FMRI is used to provide a map of the rate of oxygen use, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. The subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. Thus, option A is not supported by the passage. The modular theory of mind holds that mental activity can be broken down into independent modules or components which are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise has not been supported by the passage. So, option B is not supported. Option C is a factual statement that has been mentioned in the passage. However, the reverse may not necessarily be true - that the areas of the brain which are most metabolically active only show up during certain cognitive tasks. Option D is not supported by the passage. Option E is also not supported by the passage. The passage does not mention how several regions of the brain light up with metabolic activity when a brain scan subject experiences anger.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been reliable for years and that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The author sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match," and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the uniformity of standards for fingerprint examiners.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is an important and reliable form of evidence with low error rate.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards and there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification.
  The authors have opposing views on the reliability and the accuracy of fingerprint identification.
  The authors do not discuss the issue of uniformity in training of fingerprint examiners, nor do they mention different agencies requiring different degrees of correlation for examiners to declare a match.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and experts have long concurred about its reliability, despite not attaining the status of scientific law.
  Passage A claims that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review and that examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements.
  Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. It also discusses the unknown likelihood of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice, which has received little systematic study. 
  The authors could disagree about different aspects of fingerprint identification. 
  A is mentioned in Passage A but not in Passage B, so it is not a point of disagreement between the authors. 
  The likelihood of an examiner incorrectly declaring a match is mentioned in both passages, but Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate, while Passage B suggests that the error rate has received little systematic study and provides a more rigorous test that showed a 34% rate of erroneous identification. This can be viewed as a disagreement, so B is a possible answer. 
  Passage A does not suggest that fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, while Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match and there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. This can also be viewed as a disagreement, so C is a possible answer. 
  The relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification is mentioned in Passage B but not in Passage A, so it is not a point of disagreement between the authors. 
  E is mentioned in both passages and while the authors have slightly different emphasis, they are not in direct disagreement about this point.

  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification evidence has been used for 100 years, is reliable, has established error rates, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
The authors of both passages have different views on the reliability of fingerprint identification evidence.
Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable and has an exceedingly low error rate.
Passage B argues that fingerprint identification lacks objective standards, different examiners have different methods, and that there is little systematic study of the error rates.
The authors do not disagree about the desirability of uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners, nor whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require. The authors do not explicitly discuss the likelihood of a fingerprint examiner incorrectly declaring a match in a given criminal case. 
The authors disagree about the status of fingerprint identification as scientific law and the relative merits of point counting and holistic methods.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification has been reliable over the years despite the lack of uniform, objective standards.
  Passage B, on the other hand, accuses the fingerprint examiners of being inconsistent and unable to determine what constitutes a match.
  The authors would most likely disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the error rate of fingerprint examiners.
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate and that examiners are held to a consistent approach to identification. On the other hand, Passage B claims that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is reliable, has consistent standards, and that it has stood the test of time.
  Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match, and that there is no consensus about how many points of similarity are needed. It also claims that the error rate for fingerprint identification has received little systematic study.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the "uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners" because Passage A suggests that examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. On the other hand, Passage B suggests that there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match, and that some examiners reject point counting for a more holistic approach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A indicates that the court supports the reliability of fingerprint identification and believes that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review.
  Passage B, on the other hand, suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards and there is no consensus as to what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. The passage also describes a more rigorous test that showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is reliable and has low error rates.
  Passage B suggests that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards and the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice is unknown, and that there is criticism about the current proficiency tests.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the reliability and error rates of fingerprint identification.
  The disagreement is highlighted by the contrasting positions taken by each passage about the error rates of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B present different views regarding the reliability of fingerprint evidence.
  Passage A argues that fingerprint evidence has been adequately tested and has proved to be reliable for over 100 years. Uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, although different agencies may require different degrees of correlation.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study, and different proficiency tests show varying rates of erroneous identification.
  The authors are most likely to disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification.

Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Thought:
The question asks for a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
In the given passage, the author discusses several psychological explanations as to why stealing thunder may be an effective tactic in courtroom proceedings. These include creating an image of credibility, providing an impetus for critical assessment, making the evidence seem scarce, and framing the evidence positively.
None of these factors are directly related to the timing of the thunder-stealing message in relation to the opposition's message.
Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
The passage mentions nothing about lawyers' abilities to assess jurors, so B is incorrect.
There is no mention of clients who are willing to testify about their past mistakes, so C is incorrect.
D is a possibility because the passage states that jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case and can be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their analysis of the trial information.
E is outside of the scope, and the passage does not mention anything about lawyers' screening of jurors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The author mentions several factors that explain the success of the "Stealing Thunder" strategy:
- Stealing Thunder may create an image of credibility.
- Stealing Thunder may also provide jurors with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing testimony that the opposition plans to present.
- Jurors are likely to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information.
- A persuasive message will increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce.
- When evidence is also presented by the prosecution and the defense, the stolen evidence may be seen as "old news" and carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony. 

Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Response 2:

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that retribution should be abandoned in the criminal-justice system in favor of deterrence.
  It suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms, and in some cases, this might mean lighter punishments.
  Passage A also states that people may not be making free and rational moral choices, and their decisions may be influenced by emotional centers in the brain.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism, and it distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  The source of the cause determines whether an action is free or constrained.
  Passage B does not mention self-delusion or moral responsibility specifically.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that retribution should be abandoned and law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage A suggests that people may be deluded about free and rational moral choice and that activity in emotional centers in the brain can be the real cause of a moral choice, rather than in the region of the brain associated with problem solving.
  Passage B discusses the concept of determinism and the coexistence of free will and determinism.
  Passage B argues that constrained actions are those caused by external sources, such as mental disorders like kleptomania.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained, and the source of the cause should determine whether an action is free.
  Based on the analysis, the concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A is mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how behavior is caused by the brain and suggests that retribution should be replaced by a focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses how the concept of free will can coexist with determinism and introduces the distinction between free actions and constrained actions.
  Passage B argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained and the source of a cause determines whether an action is free.
  Mental disorder is mentioned in passage B but not in passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that neuroscience shows how the physical brain causes behavior, which undermines the idea that moral choices are free and rational.
  This undermines the view of retribution in punishment.
  Instead, we should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that determinism does not exclude free will.
  Ayer argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Actions that originate from a healthy brain are free, even though they are determined.
  Ayer also distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  Therefore, passage B argues about the concept of free will, whereas passage A does not discuss this concept.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that neuroscience findings suggest that the law should abandon retribution and focus on deterrence of future harms.
  Passage B discusses soft determinism which argues that even in a deterministic world, people can still act freely, as long as their actions are not constrained.
  The difference between the concepts in the two passages is that Passage B discusses the concept of free choice which plays a role in arguing for soft determinism but not in Passage A in which the argument is based on the brain being the sole cause of behavior and suggests abandoning moral responsibility and retribution.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain alone cause behavior and that people who think they are making a free and rational moral choice may be deluding themselves.
  Passage A suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than punishing people for their immoral acts.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism and that actions are free as long as they are not constrained by external sources.
  Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions, where free actions are caused by one's own will and constrained actions are caused by external sources.
  Therefore, the concept of "free choice" is discussed in passage B but not in passage A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The argument in passage A is about the role of the brain in human behavior and the implications it has for law.
  The argument in Passage B relates free will to determinism.
  Passage A talks about self-delusion in making moral choices based on emotional activity in the brain.
  Passage B talks about the possibility of free will in deterministic world by distinguishing between free and constrained actions.
  Mental disorder is mentioned only in Passage B.
  Free choice is mentioned in both passages.
  Causality is mentioned in both passages.
  Self-delusion is mentioned only in Passage A.

  Passage A suggests that the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that people can still act freely even in a deterministic world if their actions are not constrained.
  Passage B distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions.
  Mental disorder is discussed in Passage B but not as an essential part of the discussion.
  Free choice is a concept discussed in both passages.
  Causality is discussed in both passages.
  Self-delusion is discussed in Passage A but not in Passage B.
  Moral responsibility is discussed in Passage A but not in Passage B.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The argument in Passage B is about soft determinism and free actions.
  Mental disorder, free choice, causality, self-delusion, and moral responsibility are all mentioned in both passages.
  Therefore, none of the options play a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the operations of the brain cause behavior.
  As a result, the criminal-justice system should abandon retribution and focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage A highlights the importance of neuroscience and brain scans to understand how the brain makes decisions.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.
  Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free.
  Passage B does mention mental disorders as an example of constrained actions, but this concept is not unique to passage B.
  Passage A mentions self-delusion and the fact that people may believe they are making a free and rational moral choice when they are not. However, free choice is a concept that appears in both passages.
  Causality is also mentioned in both passages, but the focus of passage A is on how the brain causes behavior, while the focus of passage B is on how determinism can coexist with free will.
  Moral responsibility is a concept that is present in passage A, where it is argued that the criminal-justice system should focus on deterring future harms, rather than punishing bad people because of their freely chosen immoral acts.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Response 0:
Thought:
The passage describes how the nuclear fission was discovered and how the physicists went through it, so the answer should be mentioned in the passage.
The passage mentioned that the theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed to achieve such a result, and researchers did not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. It means that they ignored the earlier theoretical developments.
The passage also mentioned that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, they found by-products of the neutron bombardment of uranium, and these products remained unidentified for a long time because the precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
The passage also stated that the researchers were not aiming to split uranium atoms; they were just bombarding it with neutrons.
Therefore, the best answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the historical discovery of nuclear fission and the role of physicists in achieving this discovery. 
  According to the passage, researchers had produced theoretical calculations indicating that it was possible to split atoms, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated.
  Neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, and scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Researchers worked on discovering substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, which remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. 
  Late in 1938, Otto Hahn wrote to Lise Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, which would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, during the 1930s, the physics community did not reevaluate calculations indicating that atoms could be split. They also did not recognize the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium until Lise Meitner made the discovery.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  During the 1930s, physicists did not recognize what they were witnessing with neutron bombardment of uranium, despite accumulating evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  Theoretical physicists before that time already had produced calculations that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Meitner noticed that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism observed before.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  The passage did not mention anything about the community's reevaluation of calculations, or that uranium was the easiest to split, or the recognition of the dangers of working with radioactive substances.
  On the other hand, the passage mentions that earlier theoretical physicists already had produced calculations that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery was made between 1934 and 1939.
  Scientists were compiling increasing evidence, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Even earlier, theoretical physicists produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The expectations were that all the products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Only in 1939, did Lise Meitner provide the crucial theoretical connection by recognizing the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  She coined the term "nuclear fission" and submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with physicist Otto Frisch.
  When scientists rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, during the 1930s, the physics community did not recognize what they were witnessing in the neutron-bombardment experiments.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Which one of the following is most nearly equivalent to what the author means by "the relevant evidence" (line 62)?
Choices:
  A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939
  B: the results of related experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by Meitner in 1938
  C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium
  D: the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus
  E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author argues that the relevant evidences have been present for a long time.
The author suggests that the relevant evidence is the evidence that scientists have compiled between 1934 and 1939 related to nuclear fission.
The author also suggests that the relevant evidence is crucial theoretical connection made by Austrian physicist Lise Meitner in 1939.
The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found is a part of the relevant evidence. 
However, the explanation of this finding is provided by Meitner, which makes her work and finding about nuclear fission a crucial part of the relevant evidence.
Therefore, Choice A, B, and C can be eliminated. 
The fact that the sum of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus is an essential piece of evidence, but it is not equivalent to all relevant evidence. 
Thus, this narrows it down to choice E, which discusses how the relevant evidence went unidentified for so long, and that seems to accurately reflect what the author means by "the relevant evidence." 
Therefore, the answer is E: the fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author discusses the evidence that scientists had in order to conclude that the nuclei of atoms could be split.
  The relevant evidence was always present, but the scientists lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions the relevant evidence in the same context as the right conceptual link.
  Based on the context, it is most likely that the relevant evidence refers to what was missing in order for the scientists to fully comprehend the observations they were making during the neutron bombardment experiments.
  Therefore, the answer is not A - results of neutron bombardment experiments, B - Meitner's research and experiments, C - Hahn's clear chemical evidence of barium production, or E - unidentified radioactive products of neutron bombardment.
  Instead, the answer is D - the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus, which was the missing conceptual link that would allow scientists to understand that they were splitting uranium atoms.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author refers to "the relevant evidence" in the context that it had been present for some time.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was a result of the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The author states that the researchers "compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved" (lines 4-5).
  The relevant evidence is thus the evidence of nuclear fission that scientists had collected over time but had not recognized for what it was.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The phrase "relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that was needed to show that uranium atoms were being split by neutron bombardment.
  The author states that Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data and coined the term "nuclear fission".
  According to the passage, Hahn's clear chemical evidence that barium was produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was significant because it demonstrated that uranium atoms had been split.
  Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The phrase "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that was present all along but lacked the conceptual link.
The author mentions that Meitner recognized the significance of the data related to underlying theoretical considerations.
The theoretical understanding regarding the splitting of atoms in principle was already there before the neutron-bombardment experiments.
The results of experiments involving neutron-bombardment were important, but they mainly lacked the right conceptual link.
Hence, the most appropriate option is D, that is, the fact that the sum of the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium was the same as the number of these particles in a uranium nucleus. Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence that the author refers to is related to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was the result of neutron bombardment experiments on uranium.
  Through these experiments, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved.
  The evidence of nuclear fission was present for some time but lacked a conceptual link.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence referred to in the text is the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, which led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The relevant evidence is what had been present for some time. 
  The paragraph describes the history of the discovery of nuclear fission. 
  The discovery is attributed to the experimental results of the neutron bombardment of uranium.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The author mentions that "the relevant evidence" had been present for some time, but it was lacking the right conceptual link.
The author also mentions that Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
From the context, it can be inferred that "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence of nuclear fission.
Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The "relevant evidence" is what was lacking for some time before the right conceptual link was made.
The author has already established that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, just lacking a link.
The discovery of nuclear fission happened when Meitner made the right conceptual link upon hearing that barium was produced by neutron bombardment.
Therefore, the relevant evidence must be the clear chemical evidence that barium was produced.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The paragraph discusses the discovery of nuclear fission, which was made through experiments and the theoretical work conducted by physicists such as Fermi, Hahn, and Meitner.
  The author states that the relevant evidence was present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link. Therefore, the relevant evidence is the evidence that supported the discovery of nuclear fission.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.

  To challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, we need to find a statement that contradicts one of these characterizations.
  A, B, C, and D do not seem to contradict the author's characterizations.
  E seems to contradict the author's characterization that Lichtenstein exuded a kind of deliberate naivete. If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would suggest he did not exude deliberate naivete, but instead was interested in works that conveyed emotions.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as combining parody with a seriousness of theme.
  Lichtenstein's work was part of a rebellion against the emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  The author describes Lichtenstein's work as exuding a kind of deliberate naivete, not jaded cynicism.
  The question asks which statement would MOST challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein's characterizations or actions contradicted the author's characterization of him, it would challenge the description.
Action: Answer("D") 
Explanation: 
  Choice A, B and C all describe Lichtenstein attending exhibitions and praising early abstract expressionism and producing emotional painting. These statements do not directly contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work.
  Choice E does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, because the description already states Lichtenstein's work exudes a kind of deliberate naivete, not jaded cynicism.
  Choice D, if true, would directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. The description of Lichtenstein's work states that he exuded a deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed in some other pop artists. Therefore, Lichtenstein would not criticize another pop artist for producing paintings with emotion or void of emotion. Thus, Answer("D") is the correct answer.

Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.

Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A emphasizes the importance of spreading accurate knowledge about a company as widely as possible, and insists that people who act on accurate knowledge of changing circumstances should be permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  Passage B emphasizes the importance of transparency in the stock market. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time, and success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions.
  Choosing the option that is most closely aligned with the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Option A is too general, and disregards the importance of obtaining information from analysis of stocks.
  Option B seems to be too narrow, because it permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock and does not prohibit all trading on inside information.
  Option C is closer to passage B because it prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market.
  Option D only legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, so it is not in line with the author's position in Passage A.
  Option E legalizes trading based on inside information, which is opposed to passage A's emphasis on spreading accurate knowledge as widely as possible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible. 
  It acknowledges the legitimacy of analyzing publicly available information and making investment decisions based on it.
  But it also argues that it is unfair and compromises the market when people use information that others don't have to make investment decisions.
  Passage B supports transparency and the idea that everyone should have access to the same information at the same time.
  It argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence.
  The law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would likely permit investment decisions based on analysis of publicly available information but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
  It would aim to spread accurate information as widely and as quickly as possible to help ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Choice B conforms to this position.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author of passage A supports trading based on information that everyone doesn't have, but not based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The author of passage B is against insider trading altogether.
  A law that conforms to the position articulated by the author of passage A would permit trading based on information obtained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Thus, the correct answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. A law that prohibits all trading based on information that is not shared by everyone would achieve this purpose but would also limit the ability of people who have truly done their homework to act on accurate information that would help spread the knowledge that the price of a stock ought to be dropping or rising.
  Passage A argues that trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock is not insider trading and is not a crime. A law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would conform closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Passage A does not directly advocate for a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, or legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Both passages agree that stock markets work best when relevant information is spread as widely as possible.
  Passage A argues that insider trading is necessary for stock markets to function efficiently as long as the information is not exclusive to a few people.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market, undermines investor confidence, and could ultimately destroy the market, so transparency is the key to maintaining a healthy stock market.
  The question is asking for the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Based on the passages, a law that legalizes insider trading as long as the information is widely available and not exclusive to a few people would be the closest to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that it is normal to use information that is not available to everyone in the stock market, as long as it is not obtained from inside information.
  On the other hand, Passage B argues that insider trading compromises the transparency of the stock market, undermines investor confidence, and ultimately harms the market's integrity.
  Therefore, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B is a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading is good for the stock market because it helps spread knowledge and accurate assessments of all the relevant facts, making stock prices more accurate.
  The author of passage B believes that insider trading is bad for the stock market because it unfairly compromises the market, undermines investor confidence, and could ultimately destroy the market.
  The question asks which of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  A, B, and C are all laws that are similar to the position articulated by the author of passage B.
  D is a law that only permits selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising. This is not the same as the position articulated by the author of passage A, which is that insider trading is good for the stock market because it helps spread knowledge and accurate assessments of all the relevant facts, making stock prices more accurate.
  E legalizes trading based on inside information as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means. This is the exact opposite of the position articulated by the author of passage A, who believes that insider trading is good for the stock market because it helps spread knowledge and accurate assessments of all the relevant facts, making stock prices more accurate.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A believes that insider trading is necessary and beneficial for the stock market. 
  However, the author of passage B argues that insider trading is unfair and undermines investor confidence.
  Therefore, the law that most closely conforms to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would permit some form of insider trading, but not if it unfairly compromises the market. 
  The only choice that fits this description is B, which permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock, but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  The answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading laws should allow people to trade on the basis of information that they have that others do not.
  The author of Passage B argues that the stock market should be transparent and that insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
  The question asks which law is closest to the position articulated by the author of Passage A, but not that articulated by the author of Passage B.
  One option is to allow trading based on information that is shared by everyone, but this is not what the author of Passage A advocates.
  Another option is to permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is consistent with the position in Passage A.
  A law that prohibits trading that could undermine investor confidence in the stock market would be consistent with Passage B.
  Legalizing selling based on inside information while prohibiting buying based on inside information seems arbitrary and is not the position advocated in either passage.
  Legalizing trading based on inside information is not consistent with the position advocated in Passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that insider trading based on information that is not available to the public is an essential part of a well-functioning stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading unfairly compromises the market, as those without inside information cannot make similarly informed investment decisions.
  Passage A suggests that laws should permit those who have accurate information about changing circumstances to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  Passage A also suggests that laws should prohibit insider-trading based on information gained because of one's special position within a company.
  Passage C is most closely related to the position articulated by the author of passage A.
  Passage C proposes a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market.
  Such a law would permit insider trading based on information gained through analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage talks about two theories concerning communication in the brain.
The first theory is that communication in the brain is guided exclusively by electrical signals. This theory is not popular with neurobiologists anymore.
The second theory is that communication in the brain is guided by chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that bind with receptors in receiving neurons to render them permeable to ions, thus transmitting an electrical impulse to the neuron.
The passage discusses one aspect of the second theory, which is how neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
The passage also discusses the implications of having discovered the structure of receptors.
One of those implications is that there are subtle differences among receptors in different parts of the brain, and that these differences have the potential to be exploited for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Therefore, the correct answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage is about the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons and how it is done by the secretion of chemicals that bind to receptors on another neuron.
  The passage talks about how the structure of the receptors is responsible for converting chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The passage mentions that each of the receptors in the family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels comes in several varieties, which may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals, transmitted between neurons chemically, and because enough similarities exist among these chemicals, it may be possible to selectively treat certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories on how the communication between neurons occur in the brain.
  The first theory explains that the communication happens through electrical impulses.
  The second theory explains that the communication happens through the transmission of chemicals.
  The second theory is supported by research, which showed that the structure of the receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The newly discovered evidence allows scientists to classify neurotransmitters as a family and raise the possibility of the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that chemical transmissions, mediated by the structure of receptors, rather than electrical impulses, are responsible for the workings of the brain, and these chemical transmissions can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the evolution of the theory of brain function from electrical signals to chemical transmitters.
  The discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels allowed for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is the evidence that supports the theory of chemical transmission of impulses between neurons and the medical significance of the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes the history of scientists' understanding of how neurons communicate with each other.
  The traditional theory of communication was electrical, and scientists struggled to understand how impulses could leap across the synapses, which led some to speculate about a chemical theory.
  This chemical theory gradually gained acceptance, but scientists were skeptical because they didn't know how the binding of a neurotransmitter to its receptor could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane.
  Recently, researchers found that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and that the binding of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and open the channel component.
  This discovery has medical significance because it raises the possibility of selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity, leading to the possibility of selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  The passage then talks about how evidence has supported the idea that neurotransmitters guide the workings of the brain rather than electrical signals.
  Additionally, subtle differences exist among the receptors for these neurotransmitters, which has medical significance.
  The main point of the passage is about how the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals, how these chemicals bind with receptor molecules, and how subtle differences among these receptors may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The best answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories of communication between neurons: electrical and chemical.
  The chemical theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community.
  The mechanism by which neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions was unknown for a long time.
  Recently, researchers have discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The answer should accurately summarize the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the two theories about the transmission of electrical impulses in the brain: one is electrically and the other is chemically.
  The passage then describes how the alternative theory won acceptance and how the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions was discovered.
  It also describes the discovery of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels and how each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders is possible.
  The main point of the passage is that evidence shows the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two theories regarding the workings of the brain; electrical and chemical.
  The chemical theory explains how neurons communicate by secreting a neurotransmitter.
  This neurotransmitter is picked up by a receptor molecule which renders the neuron permeable to ions and generates an electrical impulse, which is transmitted to the receiving neuron.
  Recent research shows that the structure of the receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals, rather than electrical signals, and recent research has shown the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders based on the structure of the receptors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two theories on how the brain communicates between neurons.
  The first theory describes that electrical impulses travel through neurons.
  The second theory describes that neurotransmitters are released and bind with receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, rendering the neuron permeable to ions, which generates an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The article explains the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
  The new evidence shows that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The receptors have a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain enough similarities to constitute a family.
  The discovery of different varieties of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels could lead to selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided chemically, not electrically, and the discovery of subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes how scientists' experiments led to the discovery of prions and its impact on CJD.
  The passage also describes how prions are unique as they do not contain nucleic acid and are mainly composed of proteins.
  According to the passage, prions do not elicit the immune response in the body as they occur naturally in the body.

  Therefore, C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD is the most strongly supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the discovery of prions as a new type of protein pathogen responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
The passage highlights how prions reproduce and cause cellular destruction, and researchers have discovered that a similar process may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
The passage does not support answer A because it doesn't solely depend on injection but also can be transmitted through other means.
The passage does not support answer B because most infectious diseases are still thought to be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.
The passage supports answer C because prions need to reproduce themselves to cause CJD and because their abnormal conformation induces other prions to transform themselves.
The passage does not support answer D because the passage does not state that Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are caused by the same prion that causes CJD.
The passage does not support answer E because the passage does not compare the progression of prion diseases to diseases caused by other known pathogens.
Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.

Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).
  Prions are different from other pathogens because they do not contain genetic material and reproduce in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves.
  The cascade of transformations produces a plaque consisting of thread-like structures that collect in the brain and ultimately destroy nerve cells.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal and there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with skepticism, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.

  Abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, resulting in the formation of a plaque that collects in the brain and destroys nerve cells, causing CJD.
  Prions are unlike other pathogens, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  It is believed that prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  The passage does not support A or B.
  C is supported because the passage states that abnormally shaped prions need to be able to reproduce themselves to cause CJD.
  D is not supported because the passage states that prions causing CJD are different from those causing Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.
  E is not addressed in the passage, so it cannot be inferred that prion diseases progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.
  Therefore, the answer is C: if they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Prions are considered a new type of protein pathogen that cause CJD.
  Prions convert normal harmless cellular proteins into an abnormal form, which results in a pathogenic conformation.
  Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves.
  Prions exist naturally in the body as proteins and do not produce an immune response.
  CJD is inevitably fatal due to the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the reproduction of affected prions.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains what infection is and what causes it.
  Scientists discovered prions can cause CJD.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins, but they can convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape that has infectious properties.
  These abnormal prions can reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  This cascade of transformation produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells, causing CJD.
  Prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The passage does not say that the only way CJD can be transmitted is through injection, nor does it say that most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  The passage does say that if the prions were unable to reproduce, they would not cause CJD, so C is supported.
  The passage also says that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but it does not say that they are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD or that prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage describes a contradiction between two concepts in economic theory - the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory argues that there are increasing returns to scale, but these returns tend to create monopolies, which are opposed to the Invisible Hand.
  The assumption that returns to scale are diminishing is necessary for the Invisible Hand to work properly and assumes that there are many competitors in each industry.
  The Pin Factory was de-emphasized in economic theory for almost two centuries because it was challenging to represent mathematically.
  However, since the late 1970s, economists have developed ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are contradictory concepts in economic theory, and the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing is necessary for the Invisible Hand to work correctly. While mathematicians have focused on diminishing returns because they are easier to model, recent advances in mathematics have allowed the Pin Factory to be represented rigorously. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

- Increasing returns have only recently surfaced as an important concept in economic thought.
- The main point of the passage is not about Adam Smith but about the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
- Choice A is incorrect because it assumes that mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing. The passage states that until recently, the economics of diminishing returns dominated economic thought.
- Choice B is similar to the thought process above and is a more accurate statement of the main point of the passage. 
- Choice C is incorrect because the passage does not compare the rigor of the two concepts but rather discusses why one was more prevalent in economic thought than the other. 
- Choice D is incorrect because it is too narrow and does not fully capture the main point of the passage, which goes beyond Adam Smith's ideas to discuss the tension between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
- Choice E is correct because it accurately states that until recently, economists had failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries and only recently have developed ways to describe the Pin Factory more rigorously.

Thought:
  The passage talks about the contradiction that exists between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, in that increasing returns to scale lead to larger firms, which can drive small firms out of business, leading to monopoly which is opposed to the concept of Invisible Hand. It further says that the idea of free markets depends on the assumption of diminishing returns to scale, not increasing returns. Finally, the passage talks about how the Pin Factory has been ignored in economic theory due to the difficulty in mathematically representing the increasing returns it produces. 
  The main point of the passage is that economics has failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand and how economics has struggled to reconcile them. It explains how the Pin Factory has been difficult to represent mathematically and how this has lead to the dominance of the assumption of diminishing returns in economic thought. However, this assumption conflicts with the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. The passage explains that only recently has this issue come into the mainstream of economic thought due to developments in mathematics. 
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that until recently economists have failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries, due in part to the difficulty in representing the Pin Factory mathematically, but recent developments have enabled the subject to be brought into mainstream economic thought.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  E: Although the Great Migration was initially triggered by the income differential between the North and South, other factors must be cited in order to explain its duration over several decades

  The passage talks about the Great Migration of African Americans from Southern US to the Northern industrial cities from 1915 to 1960.
  The passage mentions three catalysts of the Great Migration: increased labor demand in the North, immigration cut off due to war in Europe, and boll weevil infestation which reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s.
  The passage suggests that once migration started, it develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. It also mentioned that earlier migrants help reduce the physical cost of moving and provide cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.
  The passage ends by mentioning a point that although the initial cause of the Great Migration was income differential between North and South, other factors also played a role in its duration.
  Option A and B are only the historical factors that triggered the Great Migration but do not fully capture its extent and reasons for its duration.
  Option C and D are direct statements from the passage explaining how earlier migrants helped in reducing the cost of migration for later migrants, which is only one of the reasons provided in the passage contributing to the Great Migration.
  Option E talks about a point that the passage ended with, but that is not the main point of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:

  Therefore, the most likely point of agreement between the two passages is that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that some insider information can benefit the stock market when it is spread quickly and widely.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.

Response 5:
Thought: 
  The relationships between the primary and secondary substances in plants can be compared to the relationship between two types of components in a different system.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning of plants while secondary substances provides them with distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances can attract insects to the plants, defend plants against them, or warn them of a harmful substance.
  Similarly, in one of the other systems, one type of component can be considered to be essential while the other type provides additional features or functions.
  These additional features or functions are not mandatory but are distinctive and helpful.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is that primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, while secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  The relationship should be analogous to a set of relationships where one group contains things that are necessary for a process, while the other group contains things that are different from the necessary things, but are still associated with the process.
  The only option that matches this relationship is B, where mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is that primary substances are essential to growth and internally necessary for proper functioning while secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that are not necessary for growth or metabolism but do give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Among the choices, B is the closest analogous relationship. Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run (i.e. primary substances), while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look but automobiles can run without them (i.e. secondary substances).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Taruskin's position is that "high art" is produced by and for political and social elites.
  A subtle analysis tells sociohistorical critics how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  This analysis can only work if two conditions are met.
  The two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class.
  The most talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes.
  A great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Some art that goes against the grain of elite values may endure.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The first way was to hire a well-known artist for a project, while the second way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
  Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, which embodied the ideology of the elite.
  However, the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class was not always good enough to produce an art that endures.
  Therefore, talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment.
  Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Some of this art endured, so the sociohistorical critic had to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

  Taruskin and others fail to clarify that artists could have subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  There are two social classes able to commission art: the aristocratic/governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  The taste of these classes has not always been apt to produce enduring art.
  Some of the art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must claim that such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.

  Sociohistorical critics prefer to analyze the art produced the second way, as it embodies the ideology of the elite.
  However, this kind of analysis requires that the elite display a recognizable identity and consensus.
  The taste of the aristocracy and upper middle class has not always produced enduring art.
  Some great art has been produced by talented artists who found a place in the margins or was paid for unwillingly.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analysis to identify how this art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to the views in choices A, B, D, or E.

  Some of this art endured, and Taruskin claimed that it embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals were revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved. 
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to view "C".
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage talks about Taruskin’s view on the production of art by and for political and social elites that reflects their values and way of life and how to analyze such art. Taruskin and others mostly deal with art produced by creating a work that reflected one’s ideals and way of life. This art embodies the ideology of the elite, and in some cases, it endures. The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to A, B, D, or E. Option C is a valid view as it aligns with the suggestion in the passage that the art that apparently undermines the ideals of the elite actually supports it in some way. Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

  The passage describes that dance had been neglected as an area of social research by social scientists because previously most social scientists did not have expertise in dance, while dance experts were not trained in social research methods.
  The passage also describes Dunham's approach to research diverging from the methodology that prevailed at the time, and her colleagues advising against becoming too involved in the dances she was observing.
  These suggest that Dunham's peers would have been most likely to agree with the idea that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, because they advised against being too involved in the dances.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The peers referred to in line 22 are most likely the contemporaries of Katherine Dunham, who were social scientists.
  The passage states that dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas that were recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.
  The passage does not suggest that Katherine Dunham's peers would agree with statement A, C, D, and E.
  The passage suggests that Katherine Dunham's peers subscribed to the long-standing view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment, indicating that they would agree with statement B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
In the passage, Katherine Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research; no social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
Peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which of the following statements about the study of dance?
Option A suggests that most social scientists misinterpreted the study of dance. There is no evidence of such a view in the passage.
Option B argues that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, which contradicts Dunham's approach to research mentioned in the passage.
Option C proposes that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. There is no suggestion of such a view in the passage.
Option D suggests that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology. There is no evidence to support this view in the passage.
Option E claims that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. There is no such view in the passage.
The passage suggests that peers would not have recognized dance as an area of social research and therefore would have neglected it. Therefore the answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.

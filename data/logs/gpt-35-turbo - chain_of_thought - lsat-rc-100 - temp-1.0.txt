Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs of terms would most likely be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors?
Choices:
  A: insular, cosmopolitan
  B: altruistic, egocentric
  C: happy, miserable
  D: misguided, admirable
  E: lucky, primitive
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B both describe the desire for people to earn more money than others.
  Passage A refers to this as the phenomenon of rivalry and explains that people are happy being poorer, if their relative position improves.
  Passage B refers to this as material wealth and explains that people use it to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Neither passage implies that the person has negative character traits or emotions such as misery.
  Both passages present the desire as being driven by human nature or societal values.
  Based on this, it is unlikely that the authors would use terms like "misguided" or "altruistic" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. 
  Rather, they would likely present the person as being driven by ambition or a desire to be successful.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
The first passage discusses the phenomenon of rivalry in terms of happiness.
People are happy to be poorer provided their relative position improved.
The second passage discusses the desire to make more money in terms of creating value.
Scholars portray the wanting to have more than others as evidence of the desire to create value, which benefits society.

Action: Answer("D") - misguided, admirable.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A and passage B discuss how people compare themselves to others, including how they compare their income with some norms, and how they compare themselves with their reference group.
  People prefer relatively high income compared to their reference group, but this is not primarily because they want to demonstrate superiority to others to help ensure mating prospects and keeping genetic lines going; rather it is because people feel they are successful and creating value.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely use the term "admirable" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A and Passage B suggest that people want to make more money than their neighbors because they want to feel successful and create value.
  Passage B argues that this is actually an altruistic tendency that benefits society.
  Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B would most likely describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as "admirable".
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses the phenomenon of rivalry where individuals are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves. The study also indicates that how people compare to their "reference group" is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors may be doing so because they want to create more value and feel successful, rather than out of an ignoble tendency of wanting to have more than others.
  Neither passage specifically describes a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors as "altruistic" or "egocentric".
  While passage B suggests that wanting to create value benefits society, it does not indicate whether the authors view this tendency as "admirable" or "misguided".
  Passage A does not provide any evidence to suggest that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors may be described as either "insular" or "cosmopolitan".
  The authors do not suggest that such individuals are either "lucky" or "primitive".
  Based on the passages, the authors are more likely to use the term "primitive" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B both discuss the relationship between wealth and happiness.
  Both passages suggest that people compare themselves with others when it comes to wealth and success.
  Passage A suggests that people want to improve their relative position for happiness and that they overinvest in acquiring material possessions.
  Passage B suggests that people feel they are successful when they create value, and that wanting to create value benefits society.
  However, neither passage uses any of the pairs of terms listed.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B both discuss the concept of happiness in relation to money.
  According to passage A, people's reported happiness is affected by their income relative to others in their society.
  Passage B suggests that earning more money, and feeling successful as a result, can make people happy.
  The author of passage B suggests that people who want to make more money than their neighbors are motivated by a desire to create value.
  The authors do not provide terms that suggest a negative connotation.
  Therefore, the answer is not D: misguided, admirable or E: lucky, primitive.
  The authors also do not suggest that altruism or egocentrism are drivers for wanting to make more money than one's neighbors.
  Therefore, the answer is not B: altruistic, egocentric.
  The words insular and cosmopolitan do not seem relevant to the concepts being discussed.
  Therefore, the answer is not A: insular, cosmopolitan.
  That leaves us with C: happy, miserable as the only option that represents corresponding pairs of terms that might be used by the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passages discuss why people want to earn more money and how earning more money affects happiness.
  The authors present different views, but both agree that people desire to create value.
  The authors argue that wanting to create value is beneficial and brings happiness.
  The authors do not judge or use negative terms to describe people who want to earn more money than their neighbors.
  None of the answer choices match the authors' descriptions.
  The question is asking for terms used by the authors of passage A and passage B to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
  However, the authors did not describe people with such terms. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B discuss why people want to make more money than their neighbors.
  In Passage A, the authors suggest that people want to make more money than their neighbors to maintain or improve their social status.
  In Passage B, the authors propose that people want to make more money than their neighbors to demonstrate that they create value.
  Neither passage describes this desire to make more money than one's neighbors in terms of being either altruistic or egocentric.
  Similarly, neither passage describes this desire as being misguided or primitive.
  Therefore, none of the pairs of terms given in the answer choices is likely to be used by the authors of the passages in reference to an individual who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B suggest that people use money to signify their success and to create value.
  According to Passage A, people are comparing their income to some norm, with the norm rising in tandem with actual income. This phenomenon of rivalry makes our relative position crucial to our happiness.
  According to Passage B, people use material wealth to show that they are prosperous because they create value. Wanting to create value benefits society and brings happiness.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is insular, happy, lucky, or primitive.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is altruistic. However, in Passage B, the authors suggest that wanting to create value benefits society, which could be interpreted as an admirable trait.
  Neither passage suggests that a person who wants to make more money than their neighbors is egocentric, misguided, or miserable.
  Therefore, the answer is B: altruistic, egocentric.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: By commercializing the research enterprise,biotechnology patents threaten the progress of basic research in the biological sciences.
  B: The recent shift away from a communal tradition and toward a market-driven approach to basic scientific research has caused controversy among scientists.
  C: The current system of patent protection for intellectual property unfairly penalizes both academic researchers and commercial interests.
  D: Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.
  E: Patent litigation is so expensive that biotechnology patent holders are unlikely to bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research.
Response 0:

  The main point of the passage is to explore debates and controversies surrounding biotech patents and their effect on basic research.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The passage is discussing the controversy over patent protection in the biotechnology industry. While some believe that patenting biological inventions will hinder basic research by restricting access to materials needed for research, others argue that patent protection stimulates innovation and progress. Although there are concerns that this approach could restrict access to research materials, the essay argues that the fear is largely unwarranted due to the expense of bringing about a patent infringement lawsuit and the long-standing tradition of protecting noncommercial scientific research. The essay maintains a neutral position and does not consider the patenting system unfair, an indication that it is not answer choice C. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The article explains the controversy surrounding intellectual property rights, specifically in biotechnology research. The discussion is focused on the benefits and drawbacks of patenting biological materials, the effect of patented inventions on basic scientific research, and whether patents will spur or hinder investigation in biotech.
The author argues that although some scientists are concerned that patents will prevent their ability to conduct basic research, this worry is unfounded. Patent litigation is expensive, and it is usually only initiated to protect a market position held by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. 
The article concludes that patents provide a compelling incentive for scientists to innovate and will potentially spur rather than hinder basic research.
The main point of the passage is that although some researchers fear that patenting biotechnology will limit their ability to conduct basic research, concerns are unfounded, and patents will encourage innovation. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the views of biotechnology industries and academic researchers on patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions.
  It also explains the perceived threat of restrictions on access to research materials and fears of exorbitantly high fees.
  The passage argues that researchers who resist the idea of patenting on biological materials mistake it with the control of access to biological materials and explains the benefits of patents for scientists.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is about the benefits of patenting for the progress of basic research in biotechnology despite concerns about access restrictions on research materials.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the advantages and disadvantages of biotechnology patenting. 
  Biotechnology industries, as well as academic institutions researchers, view intellectual property protection as necessary.  
  However, restrictions on access to research materials may hinder basic research. 
  Researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for accessing patented materials and patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's trying to stop further research through a legal action for patent infringement or refusing to make materials available to scientists conducting basic research. 
  Nevertheless, the passage argues that a patent holder cannot refuse access to the material and prevent research. 
  Patenting brings compelling incentives to innovate and results to benefits for researchers and industries. 
  Therefore, the passage suggests that the concerns expressed by academic researchers about the negative impact of biotechnology patents on basic research are generally misguided.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions, particularly those based on discoveries arising from basic research. There is concern that the restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences and cell lines, needed by scientists to conduct basic research may arise from enforcement of a patent right or through a contractual agreement. The author argues that fears that patenting biotechnology discoveries will result in the patent holder's trying or threatening to enjoin further research via a legal action for patent infringement are unfounded and that patents will not hinder basic research. The author notes that the commercialization of research has led to a shift from the traditional communal approach to a market model and offers an alternative view that patents provide scientists with incentives and rewards to innovate.
  Thus, option A, B, C can be ruled out.
  Option D can be ruled out because the author agrees that there are concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research but argues that such concerns are largely misguided.
  Option E correctly summarizes that patent litigation is expensive, and because of the tradition of judges respecting a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement, it is unlikely that biotechnology patent holders will bring patent-infringement lawsuits against scientists engaged in basic research. Moreover, the author argues that patents provide scientists with incentives and rewards to innovate.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the positive and negative impacts of biotechnology patents on basic research in the field.
  The author mentions the concerns of researchers surrounding making biological research materials (genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals) inaccessible and the cost involved in accessing them due to patent rights and the market model of research.
  However, the author argues that these concerns are not accurate as patents provide researchers with incentives to innovate and patents are often cost-prohibitive to enforce.
  The main point seems to be that although concerns exist regarding biotechnology patents, they are largely misplaced and the current system has more advantages than disadvantages for researchers.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The passage discusses how biotechnology patents are viewed as necessary to incentivize innovation in commercial research. It also mentions the growing concern that patents could hinder basic noncommercial research by restricting access to research materials. However, these fears are largely unfounded, as enforcing patents against noncommercial research is expensive and generally not pursued. The real effect of patents is to incentivize innovation by providing economic rewards and licensing control over discoveries.
Action: Answer("D") -  Concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research are largely misguided.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.
  B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.
  C: Most insects that feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants are able to identify these plants by means other than their characteristic taste or smell.
  D: Many secondary substances that are toxic to insects are thought by scientists to have evolved independently in various unrelated species of plants but to have survived in only a few species.
  E: Some toxic substances that are produced by plants evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances.

Therefore, "most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses" is the best inference made from the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary. 
  Secondary substances are responsible for the characteristic smell and taste of plants and can have a role in attracting insects that aid in pollination or in defending against herbivores.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage?
Choices:
  A: A publishing house is able to greatly improve the productivity of its editors by relaxing the standards to which those editors must adhere. This allows the publishing house to employ many fewer editors.
  B: A large bee colony is able to use some bees solely to guard its nectar sources. This enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
  C: A school district increases the total number of students that can be accommodated in a single building by switching to year-round operation, with a different quarter of its student body on vacation at any given time.
  D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
  E: A large ant colony divides and produces two competing colonies that each eventually grow large and prosperous enough to divide into more colonies. These colonies together contain more ants than could have existed in one colony.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale refer to a situation where a larger production or factory results in a larger per worker output.
  According to the passage, the pin factory uses increasing returns to scale to efficiently increase production.
  The passage mentions that bigger firms drive smaller firms out of business and that monopolies can be an issue with the use of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, we can find the choice that best illustrates the use of increasing returns to scale through the example that depicts a larger production or factory results in a larger per worker output while avoiding the issue of creating monopolies.
  Choice B, the one about the bee colony, is the best illustration: the use of some bees solely to guard its nectar sources enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the Pin Factory as an example where specialization of labour and increased size of the factory lead to increased productivity.
  This can also result in increasing efficiency and decreasing unit costs.
  Such returns to scale lead to gains for larger firms creating a tendency toward monopoly, driving smaller firms out of business.
  With increasing returns, the market power that larger firms develop could distort competition, undermining the power of the invisible hand to allocate resources efficiently.
  Only if firms experience diminishing returns at some point do small firms have an opportunity to enter and compete in the marketplace.
  So, the correct answer must describe a scenario where a larger entity replaces several smaller entities to provide efficiency gains.
  Option A, B and C do not fit into this relationship between the size of the firm and productivity.
  Option D suggests technological advances, which, while helpful, are not clearly tied to size.
  Option E talks about the replacement of a small colony with two larger and prosperous colonies, thus providing a clear example of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The concept of increasing returns to scale means that larger firms can achieve lower costs and greater productivity per worker, which creates a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The bigger the firm, the more specialized its workers can be, and the more output it can produce per worker.
  Answer A is not correct because relaxing the standards for editors results in lower productivity, which would not lead to greater productivity per worker.
  Answer B is not correct because it describes a system designed to conserve resources, not to increase productivity per worker.
  Answer C is not correct because year-round schooling does not enable more students to be served per worker.
  Answer D is not correct because it describes a technological advance rather than larger firms leading to greater productivity per worker.
  Therefore, Answer E is the best choice because it demonstrates how larger colonies can create more output than smaller ones, which is the same concept as increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Based on the passage, increasing returns to scale refer to larger companies being able to produce more efficiently and at lower costs than smaller companies.
  The example of the pin factory shows that as a factory becomes larger, workers can be more specialized and produce more pins per worker.
  The passage also says that larger companies have a natural tendency towards monopoly, driving smaller companies out of business.
  Answer choice A describes a decrease in productivity, not an increase.
  Answer choice B describes specialization within a bee colony, but does not mention increasing returns.
  Answer choice C is an example of increasing capacity, but not increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice D describes an increase in efficiency in the lobster industry due to advances in technology, which could potentially lead to increasing returns to scale.
  Answer choice E describes the process of one colony dividing into two and growing, which is not related to increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the Pin Factory concept as an example of increasing returns to scale.
  According to the passage, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  The passage further explains that many economists tried to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises.
  The choices given in the question best illustrate increasing returns to scale if they describe how a larger size or increased scale leads to increased productivity and hence increased output.
  Choice A describes reduced standards resulting in fewer editors, so it is not a good example of increasing returns.
  Choice B relates to bees processing nectar, which is not related to a business or enterprise and does not involve increasing returns.
  Choice C talks about a higher number of students in a single building, but does not indicate how the increased scale leads to increased productivity and hence output, so it is not a good example of increasing returns.
  Choice D talks about utilizing technology to increase productivity with the same number of traps, so it is a good example of increasing returns.
  Choice E describes a growth in the number of ant colonies, but again does not relate to increasing productivity in any enterprise.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage defines increasing returns to scale as resulting from specialization of tasks and the production of more goods per worker as company size increases.
  Option A is talking about decreasing returns to scale since it implies that the publisher would require more employees than in the original scenario.
  Option B is talking about how a bee colony is able to divide up work among different types of bees to increase their efficiency which is not related to business scale.
  Option C involves spreading the student body across different quarters and does not illustrate increasing returns to scale.
  Option D is talking about technology that is making the lobster industry more efficient which may have lead to decreasing costs and increasing profit per worker hence fulfilling the condition of increasing returns to scale. 
  Option E is talking about how colonies divide to increase population which is not relevant to business scale.
  Therefore, the best option that illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Increasing returns to scale is the concept that the bigger the operation, the more efficiently it can produce goods or services per worker.
  In the passage, the example of a pin factory is given to illustrate the concept.
  As the factory grows larger, its workers can specialize in more specific tasks, which increases production per worker.
  This means that increased size leads to lower costs per unit produced.
  So, the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale would be one in which the larger operation produces more goods or services per worker than a smaller operation.
  Choice A does not illustrate this idea; it describes a reduction in the workforce, not an increase in scale.
  Choice B describes a process of specialization, but not necessarily an increase in scale, so it does not capture the idea of increasing returns to scale.
  Choice C also does not describe a process of increasing scale; rather, it discusses a way to increase the capacity of existing physical infrastructure.
  Choice D describes the impact of technology, and is not directly related to the scale of operation.
  Choice E describes the division of a colony, which does not directly relate to the productivity of the colony members.
  Therefore, the answer is not among the choices given.
Answer: None of the above.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale refer to the results whereby the bigger a firm is, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the greater the effectiveness of its production process. 
  The example that best illustrates this principle is the one that shows how a company is able to produce more with fewer inputs due to the increasing specialization of its workers as it increases its scale.
  Choice A is about downsizing, which goes against the principle of scale and reducing the number of workers. Choice B is about specialization but it is not about increasing the scale, but more about the division of labor. Choice C is about using the same resources more efficiently, but it does not relate to increasing the number of employees. Choice D is about the technological improvement of a process, which does not make it clear how the scale affects the increase in production. Choice E is about the division of one colony into many colonies, which increases the number of ants but does not relate to the scale of a production process.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lobster industry as a whole is able to catch substantially more lobsters a day with the same number of traps because advances in technology make the doors to the traps easier for lobsters to get through. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Increasing returns to scale means that the bigger the firm, the more efficient and productive it becomes.
  A and E are discussing the division of work or division of a colony, respectively, but they are not related to firms' scale and productivity.
  B is about how bees collect more nectar through division of labor, but it is not about the scale of a firm or industry.
  D is about technological advancement and how it helps the lobster industry catch more lobsters. However, it is not directly related to the increasing scale of the industry as a whole.
  C has an element of increasing returns to scale because it describes how a larger school building can accommodate more students at a lesser cost. However, it is not an economic concept, but rather a managerial strategy.
  Therefore, none of the above directly describes the concept of increasing returns to scale.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale means that a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, and that there are increasing returns to scale since the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. Therefore, an example of increasing returns to scale is likely to describe how a larger business is able to achieve lower costs than a smaller business by producing more products.
  Choice A doesn't involve producing more products, so it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice B describes a way that a larger bee colony is able to collect the same amount of nectar with more efficiency, but doesn't involve producing MORE nectar.
  Choice C doesn't involve producing more products, so it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice D doesn't involve producing a bigger quantity of lobsters with the same number of traps. It describes how a technology improvement allowed an industry to catch more lobsters more efficiently. Therefore, it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice E describes how a larger number of ants are produced as a consequence of breaking into two competing colonies. But there isn't an increase in the ability to produce more ants per worker. Therefore, it doesn't illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Choice B involves different tasks being assigned to different sets of bees, and this specialization of bees is allowing the colony to collect more nectar. This specialization of tasks enables the colony to collect more nectar, as each bee is specialized and more efficient at performing the tasks it's assigned. Therefore, in choice B there is an increase of nectar being produced per worker, just like in the Pin Factory example. Thus, choice B best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale described in the second paragraph of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: With which one of the following statements regarding the sign for "sheep" (line 6) would the author of the passage be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: It could have been replaced without loss of significance by any other sign that was not already being used for something else.
  B: The sign gets its meaning in a radically different way from the way in which the cuneiform sign for "metal" gets its meaning.
  C: The way in which it represent s it s meaning resulted from the fact that sheep are an agricultural commodity rather than a product of human industry.
  D: The way in which it represent s it s meaning was not the subj ect of scientific scrutiny prior to that given it by Schmandt-Besserat.
  E: The abstract nature of the sign reveals a great deal ab out the political life of the people who used the language expressed by uniform writing.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Both passages are concerned with answering which one of the following questions?
Choices:
  A: Should people be punished for actions that are outside of their control?
  B: Does scientific research into the brain have implications regarding freedom of the will?
  C: Can actions that are not free be effectively deterred by the threat of punishment?
  D: Is the view that retribution is a legitimate justification for punishment compatible with the findings of neuroscience?
  E: Can an action be free if someone else physically forced the actor to perform it?
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the law should focus on deterrence rather than retribution considering that neuroscience shows that people might not be making free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B argues that there are free actions and constrained actions based on the source of the cause; actions from a disease-free brain are not constrained and are therefore free.
  Both passages seem to be discussing the implications of scientific research into the brain regarding freedom of the will. 
  Therefore, the correct answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: The passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to
Choices:
  A: draw a sharper distinction between reality and fantasy when evaluating the content of a literary work
  B: put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work
  C: acknowledge the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality from literary works
  D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works
  E: explain more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's third position on Russian literary criticism in which he emphasized the importance of reality as the source of literature.
  Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' demand that literature should only serve a political view or that literature should be useful.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the individual's experiences and there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  He also believed that artistic merit was necessary for a literary work and a literary work must stand or fall on its own artistic merit.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if they were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The radical critics' demand to show reality "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  He considered that artistic merit as the crucial fact in literary works.
  Therefore, if the radical critics would recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their view would be most softened.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:  
  The passage describes how Dostoyevsky stood against the radical critics’ demand that literature should be useful and should serve a particular political view. 
  Dostoyevsky’s definition of artistic lies in the ability to express thoughts in characters and images to be understood by the reader. 
  He believed that only a fully realized artistic work could fulfill its goals.
  Therefore, if the radical critics recognize the significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works, it may soften Dostoyevsky’s attitude toward their view. 
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that Dostoyevsky objected to the radical critics' view that art should be useful and should serve a particular political goal.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was far more than the merely tangible, and there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  He thought artistry was the ability to write well, and a literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  The question is asking what would make Dostoyevsky's attitude towards the radical critics' view most softened.
  Answer choice A relates to the distinction between reality and fantasy, but this is not what Dostoevsky's main concern is.
  Answer choice B contradicts Dostoevsky's belief on how a literary work should be evaluated.
  Answer choice C contradicts Dostoevsky's belief that a work of art must stand or fall on its "artistic merit."
  Answer choice E is not the solution since the passage already mentioned that Dostoevsky believed that "the radical critics' demand that reality be depicted 'as it is' was meaningless." 
  Answer choice D comes closest to his beliefs and is the best answer since the passage clearly mentions that for Dostoyevsky, "The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms." Therefore, recognizing the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works would most soften Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that the radical critics required that a literary work had to be useful and find its sources in concrete reality to contribute to the creation of a new society.
  However, Dostoevsky did not agree with the radical critics since he thought that reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics and that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  For Dostoyevsky, a literary work must stand or fall on its artistic merit, and the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of the work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear, struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky's attitude toward the radical critics' view would be most softened if the radical critics were to recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
  The answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's opinion on the radical critics' view.
  Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' idea that art must be useful in a particular political view.
  According to Dostoyevsky, a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit which is the ability to write well.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear is a contradiction in terms, as full realized artistic works only could fulfill their goals.
  It seems that Dostoyevsky's opinion would only be most softened if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.
Action: Answer("D")

  The passage describes how Dostoyevsky held a third position towards Russian literary criticism, where his understanding of reality was different to that of the radical view.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  He thought that the task of the writer was to create a literary work that exploded the boundaries between the real world and the fantastic.
  Dostoyevsky viewed the radical critics' requirement that art must be useful as unsatisfactory, saying that it was impossible to measure.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must fall on its artistic merit.
  Therefore, the answer is D: recognize the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky didn't agree with the radical critics' viewpoint.
  It doesn't seem that Dostoyevsky's attitude would be most softened by any of the choices except one.
  Dostoyevsky believed that the radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed unsatisfactory.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that what might soften Dostoyevsky's attitude would be if the radical critics recognized the full significance of artistic merit when evaluating literary works.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Choices:
  A: Even a casual reading of Jazz makes it evident that the author has intentionally tried to simulate a style of jazz performance in the narration of the story.
  B: A small number of African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century sought to base the form of their work on the typical structme of blues music.
  C: All novels about nonliterary arts and artists appear as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
  D: Depending partly on whether or not it is read aloud, any novel can be found to be somewhat musical in nature.
  E: A smaller number of African American writers than of non-African American writers in North America have written novels whose plots and characters have to do with music.
Response 0:
Thought:
The sentence states "while many African American writers have used musicians and music as a theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz". The author's assertion seems to be that Toni Morrison is the first African American novelist to use a musical genre as a structuring principle for an entire novel.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The paragraph discusses the unique structuring principle Morrison used in Jazz.
  Jazz was the first novel to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for the entire novel.
  The structuring principle is analogous to a jazz band performance.
  The band performs within the composer's constructed frame. Each musician can improvise and perform solos but within the fixed scope of a group performance.
  Morrison used a similar model to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration.
  Therefore, the author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in question if the paragraph contradicts that no novel successfully used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel before Jazz. 
  None of the answer choices contradict this statement.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage talks about how writers have tried to make their writing musical.
The author mentioned that Toni Morrison is the first writer to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
The author also points out that in Jazz, the narration mimics the style of a composition of music, where each musician improvises, but the composer has control.
The author's assertion in lines 11-16 would be most called in 10 question if which one of the following were true?
Action: Answer("B") 
The paragraph does not mention any African American novelist before Toni Morrison who wrote the  structure of their books with the form of blues music. The paragraph only mentions earlier African American writers who have used music and musicians as theme and metaphor in their works. Therefore, option B is false and cannot be true. Nevertheless, we can see that Toni Morrison is the first writer to use a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel. The whole paragraph elaborates on Morrison's creative approach of integrating the genre of Jazz into the narration of Jazz, making the narrative structure mimic the style of a composition of music. Thus, option A is correct, reflecting the passage's main idea.
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author claims that Toni Morrison is the first African American writer to construct her novel using music as a structuring principle.
  The author argues that in the novel, the connection to music is not only found in the plot but also in the way the story is told.
  Specifically, the narrator's voice slips from third-person omniscience to first-person lyricism, and the different sections of the novel are set off by quotation marks.
  This structure resembles the playing of a jazz hand, where the ensemble sound intertwines with the individuality of embedded solo performances as if with quotation marks around them.
  The comparison of the novel's structure to jazz performance implies that the author of the passage believes that the structure of Jazz is quite unique.
  Thus, Answer (C) does not follow from the passage and can be eliminated.
  The author does not make the assertion in Answer (A), which can also be eliminated.
  Answer (B) contradicts the author's claim that no African American writers before Toni Morrison had used a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel.
  Answer (D) is too broad and unfocused and is not supported by the passage.
  Answer (E) is a general statement that is not relevant to the passage's assertion on the uniqueness of Toni Morrison's utilization of jazz music as a structuring principle.
  Therefore, the correct answer is Answer("None of the above").
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author discusses Toni Morrison's novel Jazz in the context of how the novel integrates the musical genre as the structural principle to narrate the story.
  The author thus describes how the narration of the story employs a musical structure, analogous to the improvisation approach of jazz.
  The author discusses how Morrison has achieved the ensemble effect of multiple characters improvising within the bounds of the overall narrative.
  There are no mentions of the other choices.
  Therefore, neither A, B, C, D, nor E is true or relevant to the author's assertion in lines 11-16.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
The author claims that Toni Morrison in her novel 'Jazz', uses the narrative style to simulate the ensemble of characters improvising within a fixed scope. This is analogous to the style of music composition in jazz, where the musicians always performed within the composer's frame.
The assertion made by the author between lines 11-16 is in contrast to the common observation about all novels on non-literary arts and artists appearing as if their authors have tried to make their narrative styles reminiscent of the arts in question.
Among the options, only B is about a small number of African American novelists who based the form of their work on the typical structure of blues music. It is not related to Toni Morrison's innovation with the structure of narrative. Other options are either incorrect or too broad and not linked to the passage's context.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author believes that Toni Morrison's novel Jazz is unique in that it uses a musical genre as the structuring principle.
  The author gives the example of using quotation marks to simulate the improvisation of jazz performance.
  The question asks what would be most called into question if a certain statement was true.
  Among the choices, only B relates to other African American novelists writing earlier in the twentieth century who based their work on the typical structure of blues music.
  However, the passage does not mention anything about other African American novelists who used music as the structuring principle for their novels.
  Therefore, the most appropriate answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how Toni Morrison used music genre as the structuring principle for her novel Jazz. 
  The passage also compares the structure of Jazz with the playing of a jazz band and Duke Ellington's way of composing music.
  The author's purpose of writing these lines is to explain the analogy between the structure of Jazz and the composition of jazz music.
  None of the answer choices address this assertion.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage points out the unique structure of Jazz and connects its narration to the style of jazz music.
  The assertion in lines 11-16 is regarding the uniqueness of Jazz's connection to music.
  Answer choice A agrees with the author's assertion, and its accuracy would lend support to the author's claim in lines 11-16.
  Answer choice B mentions a connection between a different type of music (blues) and African American fiction, but it is unrelated to this passage's discussion of Jazz and its structure.
  Answer choice C makes a blanket statement that is unsupported by the passage.
  Answer choice D is too broad and does not relate to the author's assertion or the discussion of Jazz.
  Answer choice E mentions the frequency of North American writers who have written novels about music, but it does not relate to Jazz's structure or the author's assertion.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The author discusses how Toni Morrison used the structure of Jazz as a basis for constructing her novel. Specifically, Morrison uses quotation marks to signal when her characters are speaking, just as jazz musicians play within a certain structure. The correct answer choice should reflect this idea.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Two sides of a debate are described and a general principle is used to resolve the conflict between them.
  B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
  C: Two beliefs are described and a principle is introduced to discredit them.
  D: A general principle is described and instantiated by two different ways of solving a problem.
  E: A general principle is described and used to highlight the differences between two sides in a debate.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage is about a debate among legal scholars about the best way to deter deliberate crimes.
  On one side are those who think that societal norms and institutions are the cause of crime.
  On the other side are those who believe that crime is a choice.
  Recent scholarship has introduced the economic principle of utility maximization as a way of reconciling the two positions.
  This principle says that a person's decision to commit a crime is a rational economic choice.
  The principle can be used to analyze crime as a rational decision making process.
  Both sides of the debate can be solved by the principle if it is understood as an economic framework.
  The principle shows that a person will commit a crime if they expect to get more utility from the act than from lawful activity.
  The principle also shows that both sides of the debate are complementary and have similar effects on the decision making process.
  The optimal approach to deterrence would include elements of both sides of the debate.
  The passage describes the debate and introduces an economic principle to reconcile the two positions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage presents two sides of a debate regarding deterrence methods for deliberate crimes such as fraud.
  The options presented in the debate are increasing economic opportunities and rehabilitating convicts versus strengthening penalties and law enforcement.
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle as a way to show that both approaches have the same effect.
  Based on this analysis, the passage concludes that the two positions are actually complementary.
  The passage organizes the presented ideas by first introducing the debate, then presenting the two sides, explaining the utility maximization principle, and finally resolving the conflict between the two positions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes a debate about crime deterrence where two different positions are presented and later reconciled using an economic principle.
  The passage's organization describes two sides of the debate and applies an economic principle to decide between them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two sides of a debate on crime deterrence methods.
  The debate is centered on the influence of societal norms on individuals vs. the individual's choice.
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization and how it can be used to explain these two positions.
  The passage shows that the two deterrence methods, that came from each side, have the same overall effect.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  The debate is between two sides, one believes crime is a product of societal norms while the other believes it is an individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship introduced the economic principle of utility maximization that reconciles these two sides.
  The principle of utility maximization allows an individual's decision to commit a crime to be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The recommended strategies to deter crime from both sides affect the utility equation, making it less likely for a person to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  The passage describes two sides of a debate and introduces a general principle to reconcile them.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes a problem related to crime deterrence: how to deter deliberate crimes effectively.
  Two sides of this debate are described: one believes in changing societal norms to reduce the crime rates, whereas the other believes in harsh penalties and effective law enforcement.
  A new economic principle that reconciles these two opposing sides is introduced here, the principle of utility maximization.
  The principle of utility maximization is used here to explain the decision making of rational individuals while committing a crime.
  By applying the principle of utility maximization, both sides of the debate can be reconciled.
  Therefore, the passage is organized around the two sides of a debate and the economic principle that is used to resolve their conflict.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses a debate regarding crime deterrence.
  One side of the debate argues that societal norms and institutions contribute to deliberate crimes, while the other side argues that the decision to commit such crimes is a result of individual choice.
  The passage introduces the economic principle of utility maximization as a way of analyzing rational decision making and reconciling the two sides of the debate.
  It is then explained how the two crime deterrence methods (penalties vs increasing economic opportunities) can be complementary in reducing the expected utility of committing a crime.
  Based on this, the answer is either A or B.
  However, the passage gives more weight to the economic principle and applies it to crime deterrence methods so B is the better answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a debate about the most effective way to deter deliberate crime.
  One side of the debate suggests changing societal norms and rehabilitating those convicted of the crime. The other side suggests increasing fines, penalties and law enforcement.
  The economic principle of utility maximization shows that these two positions are complementary.
  The use of this principle can determine which of the two approaches is more effective in deterring crime.
  Therefore, the passage is organized around describing two sides of a debate and the application of an economic principle to resolve this debate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes two positions in a debate.
  Then it introduces an economic principle that shows that these two positions are complementary.
  It demonstrates how the principle informs an individual's decision to commit a crime.
  The passage then explains how the two deterrence methods have the same overall effect.
  Finally, it concludes that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both strategies.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is that two sides of a debate are described, and an economic principle is applied to decide between them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage is mainly about a debate that is currently being discussed on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  The passage talks about two sides of this debate, one side argues that society and institutions influence individuals, and another side argues that it is the individual's choice to commit a crime.
  An economic principle called utility maximization is introduced, which shows the two sides of the debate are complementary.
  The passage argues that both recommendations from each side have the same overall effect on deterring serious crimes.
  Based on the main points, it can be inferred that choice B: Two sides of a debate are described and an economic principle is applied to decide between them, most accurately describes the organization of the passage.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the function of the third paragraph within the passage as a whole?
Choices:
  A: to refute traditional interpretations of certain artifacts
  B: to present evidence that undermines a theory
  C: to provide examples that support an argument
  D: to contrast several different modes of expression
  E: to enumerate specific instances in which a phenomenon recurred
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph discusses how, in pre-contact Native American cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events.
  Autobiographical expression took many forms, such as songs, chants, stories, and even the process of retaking new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life.
  It also discusses how expression was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs.
  Dance, drama, and other artistic expressions could also convey personal history and autobiography.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following scientific episodes is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as that episode is described in passage B?
Choices:
  A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.
  B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
  C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past.
  E: When a neutron decays into a proton and an electron, the combined energies of the two particles is less than the energy of the original neutron, in apparent contradiction of the law of conservation of energy. Wolfgang Pauli postulated that a third undetected particle is also created during the decay. The particle's existence was later confirmed.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes an episode where the discovery of a planet was based on the incorrect prediction made by scientists on Uranus's orbit.
  To correctly predict Uranus's orbit, scientists needed to assume that there were no other planets in the region, but those assumptions were later proven incorrect when Neptune was discovered.
  Therefore, the most analogous scientific episode would also involve a failed prediction that led to the discovery of a new phenomenon.
  Only choice A describes a failed scientific prediction, but that prediction relates to tides, not a planet's orbit.
  Choice D refers to Earth's magnetic field, but it describes the discovery of a phenomenon, not a failed prediction.
  Choices B and C describe discoveries related to observations and rock samples, respectively.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Bernard Brunhes discovered rocks that were magnetized in a direction opposite to that of the present-day magnetic field. He concluded that Earth's magnetic field must have been reversed at some point in the past. None of the other answer choices are strongly analogous to the situation in Passage B. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  In the passage B, the astronomers were making predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the solar system.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect, and they concluded that another planet existed there causing the orbit.
  Later the planet Neptune was discovered in the precise place, and it brought their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  The question is asking for a scientific episode that is most analogous to this.
  Answer choice C describes geologic evidence leading to the discovery of an impact crater that supports Walter Alvarez's postulate of dinosaur extinction.
  This scientific episode involves the discovery of additional information that supports a pre-existing hypothesis.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. He based this on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in certain rock core samples. Later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage B talks about how astronomers used predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to search for the existence of a planet that would align the calculations with their observations.
  Then they later found the planet where they predicted it would be.
  Analogously, one of the scientific episodes should discuss a theory that predicts the existence or non-existence of something, and then it is found in the place the theory predicted or in line with the theory.
  Option C talks about a postulation based on certain evidence, and later they found evidence that strongly supports the postulation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage B describes an episode where astronomers predicted the existence of a planet based on Newton's laws and other auxiliary assumptions, and later found the planet in the precise location they had predicted.
  Among the choices, option A, B, C, and D, describe scientific episodes where a phenomenon was observed or proposed, but a prediction was incorrect in some way, leading to further investigation that resulted in the discovery of a new phenomenon or the resolution of the problem.
  However, none of them involve a prediction of the existence of a planet based on other known celestial objects.
  Therefore, the best choice is E: Wolfgang Pauli postulated the existence of a third particle in a neutron decay, which was later confirmed. This is analogous to the discovery of Neptune because both involved the prediction of the existence of a previously unknown entity based on the observed effects of other known entities.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage B describes the discovery of Neptune based on failed predictions of its orbit using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The question is asking for a scientific episode that is most analogous to this situation.
  The analogy must involve failed predictions, and then an explanation of the failure based on auxiliary assumptions.
  In choice C, Walter Alvarez's hypothesis also involved auxiliary assumptions about the presence of iridium in rock core samples, leading to a postulated asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs.
  However, this analogy is not a good fit because there was direct evidence supporting the hypothesis (a large impact crater was later discovered), whereas in Passage B, the auxiliary assumption had to be used to explain the failure of the initial prediction.
  The other choices either do not involve failed predictions or auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  In Passage B, astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions, but their predictions were incorrect.
  They revised their assumption about planet existence and predicted that there is another planet to bring their calculation into alignment.
  They later discovered Neptune in the predicted place.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a previously unknown planet to bring calculations into alignment.
  Answer choice B talks about the discovery of a galaxy and has no connection with the discovery of Neptune.
  Answer choice C also talks about the extinction of dinosaurs and has no connection with the discovery of Neptune. 
  Answer choice A discusses a false prediction of the number of high tides which doesn't align with the discovery of a previously unknown planet to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  Answer choice D talks about magnetic fields but doesn't connect with the discovery of Neptune.
  Finally, answer choice E talks about a hypothetical particle whose existence was later confirmed, but this doesn't align with the discovery of Neptune either.
  Thus, the answer is none of the above and there is no correct answer available.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage B describes how the discovery of a new planet was made after observations of Uranus' orbit were inconsistent with predictions based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Later, scientists discovered Neptune in the precise place it would have to be.
  Therefore, the scientific episode described in answer choice that resembles the discovery of Neptune is one where the hypothesis of an unknown object had to be made to bring calculations into alignment with observations.
  Answer choice C discusses the discovery of an impact crater after observing high levels of the mineral iridium. Though this leads to an explanation for the extinction of the dinosaurs, it does not involve hypothesizing an unknown object.
  Answer choice D describes a discovery of rocks that were magnetized in opposite directions. It involves a reversal of Earth's magnetic field, which is unexpected but not a hypothesis of an unknown object.
  Answer choice A discusses an incorrect prediction of tides, which is not similar to the discovery of Neptune.
  Answer choice E is about the discovery of a third undetected particle, which is not related to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, the answer is B: By observing "variable stars" —stars that vary in brightness—in Andromeda, Edwin Hubble discovered that Andromeda is actually a galaxy in its own right. This enabled him to settle the debate about whether the Milky Way constitutes the entirety of the universe.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The discovery of Neptune involved the prediction of the location of another planet in order to account for the observed orbit of Uranus.
  In the options given only option B, the discovery of Andromeda, involves the discovery and predicted behavior of a celestial object similar to the discovery of Neptune.
  Therefore, option B is the most analogous to the discovery of Neptune, as described in passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  In the discovery of Neptune section, astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus using Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  The assumption that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus was wrong.
  Astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity of Uranus, which they called Neptune.
  Scientists later found Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is when Walter Alvarez postulated that an asteroid impact caused the extinction of the dinosaurs, based on observing high levels of the mineral iridium in rock cores, and later evidence of a large impact crater was discovered in the Yucatan Peninsula that dates to the time of the dinosaur extinction.
  The answer is C: Walter Alvarez hypothesizing the asteroid impact that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  In the episode described in passage B, the astronomers made predictions that were inaccurate, which led them to hypothesize the existence of a previously unknown planet. 
  The discovery of Neptune was a result of scientists altering their auxiliary assumptions based on incompatible observations.
  Choices A and D both describe discoveries that do not involve observation of unexpected events that call already held theories into question, nor do they involve the revision of auxiliary assumptions.
  Choice B does not describe auxiliary assumptions or incorrect predictions.
  Choice C describes a theory that was initially based on observations, then later supported with more observations.
  Therefore, Choice E is the least irrelevant to the situation described in passage B.

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements?
Choices:
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author argues that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary," and regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The author suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can.
  The author also suggests that departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk.
  Answer choice A is partially true, the author suggests that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, so people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose, may or may not be agreed by the author.
  Answer choice B is not true; the author mentioned that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily.
  Answer choice C is not supported by the passage.
  Answer choice D agrees with the author's argument that there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary," and regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  Answer choice E is not accurate as the passage did not mention that the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
  
Therefore, the best answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the distinction between what risks the government should regulate and what risks individuals should be responsible for protecting themselves.
  The distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk often stems from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason might lie in an antecedent judgment of some other kind.
  The author believes that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would not agree with statement A that people should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities such as skydiving.
  The author also mentions that although risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, they are not all-or-nothing matters, but one of degree. Therefore, the author would not agree with statement B that the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  The author does not provide information to support statement C that both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  The author notes that risks incur voluntarily might not be indicative of people's approval of the purpose for which they run the risks. Therefore, the author would not agree with statement D that for public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  As for statement E, the author does not provide information to support it, and it is too general and not related to the main topic of the passage.
  
  Therefore, the best answer is A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities, such as skydiving, that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose. This statement contradicts the author's opinion, which is that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk, but it is of little utility in guiding policy decisions.
  The author argues that regulatory policy should aim to save as many lives as possible, while acknowledging the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  The author might argue that people, in general, should be protected against risks by government intervention, but there may be exceptions.
  The author might have a view on the relevance of the choice to take risks in the government's decision to regulate air safety.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The author states that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is of little use in guiding policy decisions. The author believes that regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that prompt judgments about voluntariness. And the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. The passage does not support statements A, B, C, or E. 
Statement D talks about a risk being deemed voluntary if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice. It aligns with the author's view that risks should be evaluated based on a better understanding of the factors that shape judgments about voluntariness. Therefore, the answer is D. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author suggests that judgments about voluntariness of risk are not always accurate and stem from confusion and selective attention.
  The author also suggests that regulatory policy should be guided solely to save as many lives as possible, subject to limited public and private resources.
  The author does not indicate a preference for any particular category of the risk, such as natural disasters or skydiving, as inherently voluntary or involuntary.
  Therefore, none of the choices match the author's views.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
 The author argues against the notion of voluntary and involuntary risks.
 The author suggests identifying more specific considerations when deciding whether or not to intervene in a risky activity.
 Therefore, the answer is not likely to support protecting people from risks incurred through activities that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose since it's mentioned that there's no special magic in the notions of voluntary and involuntary risks.
 The answer also wouldn't support the notion that policy experts would deem the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly to be largely irrelevant to decisions about air safety.
 The answer doesn't discuss the comparison between the different types of risks incurred by airline passengers; therefore C is unlikely to be the answer.
Option D is in line with the author's argument for better understanding the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness, and regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of these factors.
Option E is not in line with what the author has argued about voluntary vs involuntary risks.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not useful for guiding policy decisions.
  Instead, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can subject to limited resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the author would most likely agree with the statement that attempts to maximize saving lives.
  A: People should generally not be protected against the risks incurred through activities such as skydiving that are dangerous and serve no socially useful purpose.
  The author does not state that skydiving serves no socially useful purpose. Moreover, the author argues that whether a risk is voluntary or not is not a useful distinction.
  B: The fact that plane crash victims chose to fly would usually be deemed by policy experts to be largely irrelevant to decisions about the government's role in regulating air safety.
  The author does not take judgment of policy experts about the voluntariness of airplane passengers into consideration.
  C: Both the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are higher for plane crashes than for any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  The author does not provide any comparison between airplane crashes and other forms of risk.
  D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  This statement characterizes how voluntariness should be defined, but it is not equivalent to the author's argument.
  E: The main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily is the risk of natural disaster.
  While the author does not mention natural disasters, they argue that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risks is not useful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary is not useful in guiding policy decisions.
  The author suggests that understanding the underlying factors for judgments about voluntariness is more important in regulatory policy.
  The author thinks that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Option A is close but the author does not state that such activities serve no socially useful purpose.
  Option B is incorrect because the author does not state that policy experts would see the choices of plane crash victims to fly as irrelevant.
  Option C is not mentioned in the passage.
  Option D seems to reflect the author's thoughts, as he suggests that a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
  Option E is incorrect as the passage mentions that risks incurred involuntarily often stem from confusion and selective attention and refer to antecedent judgments rather than the nature of the risk itself.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author argues against using "voluntary" and "involuntary" as the basis for regulatory policy. It should be guided by saving as many lives as possible with the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
Option A is mentioned in the passage, but it is not clear whether the author agrees with it.
Option B is close, but the passage does not give a clear indication of whether policy experts would find the fact that plane crash victims chose to fly largely irrelevant.
Option C is not supported. The passage does not provide any comparison of probability of occurrence or resulting death or injury for plane crashes and other risks incurred by airline passengers.
Option D is supported. The passage explains that the notion of voluntariness for policies should not be based on whether people choose to undertake the risky behavior, but whether they have a choice to opt-out or avoid the risk.
Option E is not supported. Although it is mentioned, the passage does not suggest that natural disasters are the main category of risk which is usually incurred involuntarily.
Therefore, the answer is D: For public-policy purposes, a risk should be deemed voluntarily incurred if people are not subject to that risk unless they make a particular choice.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author argues that judgments about whether risks are "involuntary" are of little utility.
  The author suggests that government policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness.
  The author suggests that it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred.
  The author indicates that departures from the principle of trying to save as many lives as possible should be justified by specific considerations.
  The author does not suggest whether people should or should not be protected against risks incurred through activities that serve no socially useful purpose or what the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury are for plane crashes.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: According to the passage, why do university researchers increasingly believe that patents should be granted for commercially promising biotechnology discoveries?

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere unless chlorine is present.
  B: Skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  C: Few chemicals besides CFCs can result in the release of chlorine in the upper atmosphere.
  D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  E: The upward flow of CFCs into the stratosphere occurs mainly in Antarctica.
Response 0:
Thought:
- According to the passage, the depletion of the ozone layer occurs due to the reaction between CFCs and ozone that leads to the production of chlorine
- Chlorine atoms can then destroy many ozone molecules
- The destruction of the ozone layer is mainly caused by the use of CFCs
- The depletion of the ozone layer increased the level of ultraviolet radiation from the sun which contributes to skin cancer.
- The Montreal Protocol of 1987 banned the production of ozone-depleting gases
- From this information, it can be inferred that regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Molina and Rowland's research showed that CFCs deplete the ozone layer by increasing the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom can destroy up to 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Criticism was voiced about Molina and Rowland's work, but over time they were proven correct.
  As a result of their advocacy, an international agreement was made to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  The passage emphasizes that CFCs are a major cause of ozone depletion and the potential for skin cancer due to UV radiation.
  Therefore, the most strongly supported statement is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the damaging effects of CFCs on the ozone layer and how it leads to more ultraviolet radiation reaching the Earth's surface.
  There is a chemical reaction between chlorine and ozone that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The reaction is self-sustaining and numerous ozone molecules can be destroyed by one chlorine atom.
  The discovery of the hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987 which banned the use of ozone-depleting gases like CFCs.
  This ban leads to the development of more environmentally friendly products.
  The passage does not discuss other chemicals that can release chlorine into the upper atmosphere.
  The passage does not discuss skin cancer primarily being caused by excessive absorption of ultraviolet light.
  The passage does link the regulation of CFCs and the reduction of skin cancer, but the linkage between the two is indirect.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Based on the information in the passage, the following statements are made:
  - Ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer.
  - Ozone is a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  - CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer.
  - Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  - Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response.
  - The development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  The statement that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. The passage explains that the ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer and that the ozone is a shield against ultraviolet radiation. CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Therefore, regulating (banning) the use of CFCs, which contribute to ozone depletion, can help prevent excessive absorption of ultraviolet light and thus lower the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Molina and Rowland's research and advocacy led to the discovery that manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are chemically attacking and depleting the ozone layer.
  This leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere that destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  Each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 100,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive.
  Molina and Rowland's advocacy of dramatic policy changes led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can contribute to the preservation of the ozone layer, which protects against ultraviolet radiation from the sun, indirectly lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the ozone layer and its depletion due to CFCs.
  The ozone layer in the stratosphere screens out the most damaging ultraviolet radiation from the sun.
  Molina and Rowland showed the depletion of the ozone layer due to CFCs and its contribution to skin cancer.
  The discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica led to an international agreement to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer as it helps repair the ozone layer and reduce ultraviolet radiation exposure as a result of ozone depletion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the ozone layer contributes to shielding the earth's surface from ultraviolet radiation. 
  It highlights the damaging effect of CFCs on the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions how the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, even if the production and use of CFCs stopped immediately.
  It discusses the advocacy work of Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland, which led to the Montreal Protocol of 1987.
  There is no discussion of other chemicals releasing chlorine into the upper atmosphere besides CFCs.
  But the use of CFCs contributes directly to ozone depletion, and could indirectly lead to higher rates of skin cancer due to increased exposure to ultraviolet radiation.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the chemistry of the interaction between CFCs and the ozone layer and highlights the research and advocacy work done by Molina and Rowland in identifying the risks posed by CFCs.
A: The passage does not suggest that little or no ozone destruction occurs naturally in the stratosphere. This answer is not supported by the passage.
B: Although ultraviolet radiation has been identified as a contributor to skin cancer, the passage does not support a claim that skin cancers occur primarily because of excessive absorption of ultraviolet light. This answer is not supported by the passage.
C: The passage does not provide any information to support or rule out this answer. This answer is not supported by the passage.
D: The passage explains how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, which contributes to less screening of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. This has been linked to risks for skin cancers. Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs can contribute indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer. The answer is D.
E: The passage states that freon gases are released into the lower atmosphere and slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. The passage does not suggest that this occurs mainly in Antarctica. This answer is not supported by the passage.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
In the passage, Molina and Rowland's research established that the use of CFCs result in the depletion of the ozone layer and lead to an increase of the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere. Chlorine reacts chemically with ozone, destroying it and regenerating the chlorine atoms, leading to the depletion of the ozone layer. The passage also mentions that much of the sun's ultraviolet radiation is screened out by the thin, diffuse layer of ozone in the stratosphere. The depletion of the ozone layer has led to more ultraviolet radiation reaching the earth, thereby increasing the risk of skin cancer. 
Action: Answer("D") 
Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the information in the passage is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the thin layer of ozone in the stratosphere that screens out ultraviolet radiation from the sun, and how the ozone layer is attacked and depleted by CFCs.
  Molina and Rowland's research showed that CFCs do this by releasing chlorine into the stratosphere, where it destroys ozone.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to less protection from ultraviolet radiation, which can cause skin cancer.
  Therefore, regulating the use of CFCs would directly contribute to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.
  The answer is D: Regulating the use of CFCs contributes indirectly to lowering the incidence of skin cancer.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.

  The author discusses the two ways that art was produced for political and social elites.
  One of the ways was to create a work that expressed and mirrored the ideals and way of life of the elite.
  Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments were commissioned by Pope Julius II and therefore, they are an example of art produced for political and social elites in the second way.
  The frescoes do not illustrate the influence of religion on the historical development of art or the typical relationship between a patron and an artist.
  The frescoes also do not show how an artist can subvert the ideals of a patron.
  Therefore, the answer is A: to provide an example that illustrates the understanding of elitism in art favored by sociohistorical critics.
Action: Answer("A")

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author mentions Raphael's frescoes to explain a specific example of an artwork created for and commissioned by a patron.
  The author wants to explain the two different ways that art was historically "produced by and for political and social elites."
  The two different ways were to engage a famous artist to produce something for display or create a work that expressed and mirrored the elite's ideals and way of life.
  Raphael's frescoes appear to be a specific example of artwork produced in the second way.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage describes two types of relationships that existed between patrons and artists historicalyy.
The author mentions Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartments in the context of describing one of these relationships.

Topic: Law
Context: Is it necessary for defense lawyers to believe that the clients they defend are innocent of the charges against them? Some legal scholars hold that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, claiming that in democratic societies all people accused of crimes are entitled to the best possible legal representation. They argue that lawyers have no right to judge defendants because it is the job of the courts to determine guilt or innocence and the job of the lawyer to represent the defendant before the court. They believe that the lawyer's responsibility is to state those facts that will assist each client's case, construct sound arguments based on these facts, and identify flaws in the arguments of opposing counsel. According to these scholars, the lawyer's role is not to express or act on personal opinions but to act as an advocate, saying only what defendants would say if they possessed the proper training or resources with which to represent themselves. But such a position overlooks the fact that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant, certainly, but no less so to the court and, by extension, to society. For this reason, lawyers, great as their obligation to defendants is, should not, as officers of the court, present to the court assertions that they know to be false. But by the same principle, lawyers who are convinced that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence. Guilty defendants should not be entitled to false or insincere representation. When lawyers know with certainty that a defendant is guilty, it is their duty not to deny this. Rather, they should appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor, after giving due consideration to the facts on the other side, and then present any extenuating circumstances and argue for whatever degree of leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted. In cases where it is uncertain whether the client is guilty but the lawyer sincerely believes the client may well be innocent, the lawyer should of course try to prove that the client is innocent. The lawyer's obligation to the court and to society also ultimately benefits the defendant, because the "best defense" can only truly be provided by an advocate who, after a careful analysis of the facts, is convinced of the merits of the case. The fact that every client is entitled to a defense does not mean that defense lawyers should take every case they are offered. Lawyers should not be mere mouthpieces for a defendant but instead advocates for the rights of the defendant given the facts of the case.
Question: The relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: no significant relationship because they represent two unrelated factual statements
  B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines
  C: a hypothetical situation supporting a statement reported by the author in the earlier lines
  D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars
  E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to identify first the sentences between lines 28 to 31.
  After reading those sentences we have to find the relationship of the information contained in those with the sentence located at lines 7 to 11.
  The sentences located at lines 28-31 reflect that lawyers who know their clients are guilty should not argue for their innocence.
  While the sentences in lines 7-11 argue that some scholars claim that a lawyer's obligation is to provide the best defense, and that lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
  The idea in lines 7-11 implies that the primary obligation of a lawyer is to provide the best defense to a client, and the judgment falls into the hands of the court.
  In contrast, the argument in the sentences at lines 28-31 believes that lawyers should not argue for innocence if they know their client is guilty, and should instead argue for extenuating circumstances and leniency.
  Therefore, the relationship of the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 can be described as disagreement.
  The best answer is D: disagreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 explains that some legal scholars believe that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of, and not to judge defendants.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 discuss scenarios in cases where lawyers know their clients are guilty, and what their obligation to the court should be in those circumstances.
  Although the two statements refer to different matters, they are related in that they both describe the responsibilities that defense lawyers have.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28–31 to that in the sentence at lines 7–11 is that they both discuss the responsibilities defense lawyers have, although the former statement addresses scenarios where clients are proven guilty.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  I first read the sentences at lines 28–31 to verify the relationship to the sentence at lines 7-11.
  In lines 28-31, the text states that the lawyer has a twofold obligation: to the defendant and the court/society.
  The sentences at lines 7-11 establish that some legal scholars believe that lawyers’ sole obligation is to provide the best defense they can, without reference to whether the client is guilty or innocent.
  It seems that these two sentences are disagreeing with the view expressed in the earlier lines.
  The text states that the lawyer's obligation is twofold and outlines what lawyers should not do & should do when they know their clients are guilty or innocent.
  The sentences at lines 28–31 are disagreeing with the opinion that lawyers have no right to judge defendants.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about legal scholars' perspective on the obligation of defense lawyers.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 talk about the obligation of defense lawyers when they know with certainty that their clients are guilty.
  These two sets of information are making similar arguments regarding a defense lawyer's obligation to society and the court. However, these are pertaining to different contexts and situations.
  Therefore, the relationship between these two sets of information can be best described as "essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 states the obligation of lawyers to present the truth and facts of the case.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 presents an opposing view that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two sentences is that they represent two different views on the obligation of defense lawyers.
  Answer: B: the author's opinion opposing another opinion reported by the author in the earlier lines. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The sentence at lines 7-11 states that some legal scholars believe that defense lawyers' obligation is to provide the best defense. 
The sentences at lines 28-31 state that it is the lawyer's duty to appraise the case as much as possible in their client's favor and present circumstances and argue for leniency in sentencing they sincerely believe is warranted.
The second set of sentences provide an additional perspective on the relationship between lawyers and defendants that complements the information provided earlier.
There is no disagreement over the position. 
There is no hypothetical situation.
Therefore, the answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:  
  The sentence at lines 28-31 talks about the lawyer's obligation to the court and to society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about the legal scholars' belief that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  Although there may be different perspectives on this issue, the two sentences essentially talk about the different obligations of defense lawyers, with the first sentence highlighting the obligation to the court and to society in general, and the second sentence focusing on the obligation to provide the best defense possible for the defendant.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information contained in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 can be described as essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
  The answer is E: essentially equivalent assertions arising from different perspectives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 mention the obligation of a lawyer in defending a client.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 discusses the position some legal scholars hold regarding whether defense lawyers must believe that their clients are innocent of the charges against them.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 highlight that the defense lawyer's obligation is to the defendant, the court, and society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 deals with the opinion of some legal scholars who argue that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 are in agreement with the earlier position that a lawyer's obligation is to provide the best possible legal representation.
  However, the sentences at lines 28-31 add more details to the earlier position regarding the obligation of the defense lawyer.
  Therefore, the relationship between the information in the two sentences at lines 28-31 and that in the sentence at lines 7-11 can be described as an agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars.
  Thus, the answer is D: agreement in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the particulars. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The sentence at lines 28-31 starts with "But by the same principle" which refers to the principle that the defense lawyer's obligation is twofold: to the defendant and to the court.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 talks about legal scholars who believe that lawyers' sole obligation is to provide the best defense they are capable of.
  The subsequent sentences at lines 32-34 argue that lawyers who know that their clients are guilty should not undertake to demonstrate their innocence.
  Therefore, the sentence at lines 28-31 is disagreeing with the legal scholars' position stated in the sentence at lines 7-11.
  The opinion at lines 28-31 is that lawyers' responsibility is twofold - to the defendant and to the court.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The sentence at lines 7-11 explains a legal scholar position about the role of defense lawyers. 
  The sentences at lines 28-31 also state the defense lawyer's obligation.
  However, these sentences focus on situations where lawyers believe that their clients are guilty, and the lawyer should appraise the case and present arguments for an appropriate sentence.
  The sentences at lines 28-31 describe the same obligation but in a different scenario and with different details.
  Therefore, the relationship between the sentences at lines 28-31 and the sentence at lines 7-11 is agreeing in general with the earlier position but disagreement over the details.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.

Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.

Context: Most scientists who study the physiological effects of alcoholic beverages have assumed that wine, like beer or distilled spirits, is a drink whose only active ingredient is alcohol. Because of this assumption, these scientists have rarely investigated the effects of wine as distinct from other forms of alcoholic beverages. Nevertheless, unlike other alcoholic beverages, wine has for centuries been thought to have healthful effects that these scientists—who not only make no distinction among wine, beer, and distilled spirits but also study only the excessive or abusive intake of these beverages—have obscured. Recently, a small group of researchers has questioned this assumption and investigated the effects of moderate wine consumption. While alcohol has been shown conclusively to have negative physiological effects—for example, alcohol strongly affects the body's processing of lipids (fats and other substances including cholesterol), causing dangerous increases in the levels of these substances in the blood, increases that are a large contributing factor in the development of premature heart disease—the researchers found that absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream occurs much more slowly when subjects drink wine than when they drink distilled spirits. More remarkably, it was discovered that deaths due to premature heart disease in the populations of several European countries decreased dramatically as the incidence of moderate wine consumption increased. One preliminary study linked this effect to red wine, but subsequent research has shown identical results whether the wine was white or red. What could explain such apparently healthful effects? For one thing, the studies show increased activity of a natural clot-breaking compound used by doctors to restore blood flow through blocked vessels in victims of heart disease. In addition, the studies of wine drinkers indicate increased levels of certain compounds that may help to prevent damage from high lipid levels. And although the link between lipid processing and premature heart disease is one of the most important discoveries in modern medicine, in the past 20 years researchers have found several additional important contributing factors. We now know that endothelial cell reactivity (which affects the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels) and platelet adhesiveness (which influences the degree to which platelets cause blood to clot) are each linked to the development of premature heart disease. Studies show that wine appears to have ameliorating effects on both of these factors: it decreases the thickness of the innermost walls of blood vessels, and it reduces platelet adhesiveness. One study demonstrated a decrease in platelet adhesiveness among individuals who drank large amounts of grape juice. This finding may be the first step in confirming speculation that the potentially healthful effects of moderate wine intake may derive from the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
Question: In the passage, the author is primarily concerned with doing which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: advocating a particular method of treatment
  B: criticizing popular opinion
  C: correcting a scientific misconception
  D: questioning the relevance of newly discovered evidence
  E: countering a revolutionary hypothesis
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author discusses a popular assumption in the scientific community that wine, as an alcoholic beverage, has no particular health benefits.
  The author argues that this assumption is based on studies that study only excessive intake.
  The author cites research that suggests moderate wine consumption has healthful effects, such as reducing the thickness of innermost walls of blood vessels and reducing platelet adhesiveness.
  The author suggests that one plausible explanation for these healthful effects is the concentration of certain natural compounds found in grapes and not present in other alcoholic beverages.
  Therefore, the author is primarily concerned with correcting a scientific misconception.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: Which one of the following is most analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted, as described in the last two paragraphs?
Choices:
  A: One particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer,so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  C: Much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  D: Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  E: The cheetah is the worlds fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  In the case of FMRI, a baseline measurement is taken in the control condition and then a second measurement is taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to reveal metabolic activity solely associated with the cognitive task.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method used to analyze the data obscures the fact that there is distributed brain function in both conditions.
  The question seeks the scenario MOST analogous to this subtractive method
  Answer choice B seems to be the best analogy because the advertising campaign affects store patrons all year round, but an increase is only observed in the summer. 
  Similarly, the entire brain is active in both conditions, but the FMRI scan is interpreted by subtracting brain activity in one condition from brain activity in another, focusing on differential brain activity.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  FMRI scans are interpreted through a subtractive method.
  This subtractive method is used to isolate the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The entire brain is active during both the control condition and the cognitive task condition.
  The subtractive method obscures this fact and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  None of the analogies describe this process.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains that FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scans are interpreted by first taking a baseline measurement while the subject is at rest.
  A second measurement is taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  Whatever remains after the subtraction is assumed to be associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  This method is analogous to which one of the following?
  Choice (A) seems irrelevant, choice (B) indicates limitations in an advertising campaign, choice (C) highlights the impact of droughts on different sectors, choice (D) provides information about the timing of internet usage, choice (E) talks about cheetahs and their running ability that is relevant to the long term.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain before and after the subtraction.
  The remaining difference is assumed to represent only the cognitive tasks performed by the subject.
  The FMRI method, therefore, obscures the overall brain function in both conditions.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choices B, C, and D are not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans as the information in the statement does not relate to the principle of subtraction.
  Choice E is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Therefore, none of these choices is the answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage compares FMRI scans in the study of psychology with X-rays in the field of medical diagnosis.
  FMRI scans are a research method used as a way to see the mind's distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The FMRI scans are actually the result of subtraction - the baseline measurement taken during the control condition and the second measurement taken while the subject performs some cognitive task.
  The subtraction produces striking images of the brain's active parts.
  The interchangeable parts in a system can also be seen in modules and the difference between two states can provide useful information on how the system behaves.
  Therefore, the pattern in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to option B where the yearlong advertising campaign affected the increase in shoppers only during the summer season.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage explains how FMRI scans which produce striking images of the brain activity are produced through the subtractive method.
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use, by first taking a baseline measurement and then subtracting the on-task measurement.
  The method of interpreting FMRI scans is most analogous to the option that describes a process of determining the difference between two variables.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for an analogy to how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  An analogy will show how this method can be explained by comparing it to another familiar situation.
  The passage states that FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen in the brain, which is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  This differential rate only subtracts the baseline measurement from the cognitive task measurements to reveal the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task alone.
  The question choices also include other examples of subtraction and highlighting one aspect while obscurring others.
  The only choice appearing to be an analogy to the FMRI scans interpretation is B, the advertisement campaign example.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question asks to find the option that is most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity described in the last two paragraphs.
  According to the passage, the FMRI scans of brain activity depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI results are obtained by subtracting the baseline measurement in the control condition from the measurement when the subject is performing the cognitive task to find the metabolic activity associated solely with that cognitive task. 
  The FMRI method obscures the fact that the brain is active in both conditions, and a false impression is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
  Answer choice C, about water supply, might be misunderstood for a correct answer. This option talks about impact and not interpretation, which is what the question asks.
  Option A talks about a specific district that is essential to electing a candidate, analogous only in being one of many variables that considered one way produces a result and another way produces a different one.
  Option B talks about how an advertisement affected customer behavior only during the summer, analogous only in being one of various factors that influenced the outcome.
  Option D speaks about the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours, but unrelated to the interpretation of the data.
  Option E speaks about the limitations of the cheetah's speed only in some circumstances, which is not analogous to the interpretation of brain scan data as FMRI scan data.
  Therefore, the option that is most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity described in the last two paragraphs is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  FMRI scans are interpreted by subtracting the metabolic activity of a control condition from the activity of the cognitive task. 
  The method of interpreting the results of FMRI scans is analogous to another situation where differences represent the object of attention.
  A is not similar.
  B is not similar because the advertisements may have had to do with summer activities themselves rather than when the advertisements were run.
  C is not similar because the argument is focused on the amount of water used by different sectors rather than difference in levels.
  D is not similar because the attention is on the timing of Internet traffic and not differences or subtraction.
  E is not similar because the focus is not on subtraction or differentiation.
  Therefore, there does not seem to be a clear analogous scenario to compare to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question asks for an analogy to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted. 
  The interpretation of FMRI scans is based on a subtraction method by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The reasoning behind the subtraction method is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method of reasoning that solely attributes a certain event to one factor while ignoring the other factors is similar to one of the answer choices.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph would be most likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  C: It is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  D: Genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.

  The critics discussed in the second paragraph object to the second version of multicultural education.
  They argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value laden.
  According to these critics, attempting to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is distorting and an expression of cultural chauvinism.
  These critics are likely to agree with the idea that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is not possible if one approaches them solely from the majority culture's perspective or through Western scientific methods.
  According to the objection, one should adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve real understanding.
  Therefore, the critics who raise this objection would most likely agree with choice E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The objection discussed in the second paragraph suggests that understanding other cultures is impossible if approached solely from within the majority culture's perspective. This objection is based on the idea that cultures have their own unique ways of thinking and cannot be fully understood through a single outside perspective.
B: The historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values, is consistent with this idea and is the best answer.
A implies that members of different cultures cannot understand each other, which is not correct according to this objection.
C suggests that multiple cultural perspectives are necessary, but this is not exactly what the objection is stating. The objection is arguing against understanding other cultures solely through one perspective.
D is false and contrary to the objection's argument.
E is not relevant to the objection's main argument.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The objection raised in the second paragraph argues that multicultural education should adopt a non-scientific method to study other cultures, as scientific methods are Western, and other cultures often use non-scientific methods.
  The objection does not argue that genuine understanding of another culture is impossible unless that culture shares the same cultural values.
  The objection does not suggest that social and historical circumstances that give rise to a culture's values cannot be understood by members of a culture with different values.
  The objection does not argue that it is impossible for one culture to successfully study another culture unless it does so from more than one cultural perspective.
  The objection does suggest that the historical and social circumstances of a culture can play an important role in the development of that culture's values.
  The objection also suggests that the values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
The critics are arguing that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is done only through a Western scientific perspective.
They argue that the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and that to understand non-scientific cultures, one must adopt their perspectives and methods.
Therefore, the critics would most likely agree with the statement that values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The objection in the second paragraph argues that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible when examined through the lens of western scientific methods.
  They argue that the values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged.
  The objection is to the second version of multicultural education where methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity, thus not essentially different from the first version.
  Therefore, the critics of the objection in the second paragraph would most likely agree with the statement "The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science."
  The answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
The critics who raise objections against the second proposal of multicultural education argue that the western scientific heritage used in this proposal is fundamentally flawed. They suggest that in order to understand non-western cultures effectively, we need to adopt the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied using their own values. 
Option A: Does not relate to the argument that critics presented in the passage. 
Option B: The passage mentioned the importance of social and historical circumstances in the development of culture's values, this aligns with the critics presented in the passage. 
Option C: Though the passage talks about the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective, the option C statement cannot be concluded from the given information. The correct assertion is that we need to adopt a non-western perspective as well. 
Option D: The critics in the passage are arguing the opposite — that having the same cultural values is not necessary for genuine understanding of another's culture. 
Option E: The argument presented in the second paragraph supports this statement. Critics argue that examining other cultures through the sole perspective of western science is distorting and does not provide genuine understanding. 
Therefore, the answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The objection discussed in the second paragraph argues that the values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of the second form argue that Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Genuine understanding of another culture using Western scientific method is not possible because it is already founded on certain values.
  So, the best answer is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
The paragraph discusses the objections raised against the second proposal of multicultural education.
These critics argue that adopting Western methods of examination for cultures hinders from understanding cultures from their own perspective.
In particular, it is argued that the methods of social-scientific examination are already value-laden and prioritize Western scientific heritage.
According to the critics, it is only through their own perspectives and methods that cultures can be understood.
Option A suggests that members of a different culture cannot understand the values of another culture.
Option B is consistent with the second proposal of multicultural education that values the social and historical circumstances of cultures.
Option C is not discussed in the passage.
Option D contradicts the idea that cultures can be best understood through their own perspectives and methods.
Option E is consistent with the objection raised by the critics.
Therefore, the best choice is E: The values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The critics who raise the objection discussed in the second paragraph argue that using Western scientific methods, which derive from a Western perspective and heritage, to study other cultures is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism. They argue for the adoption of non-scientific perspectives and methods of the cultures studied to achieve real understanding. 
The answer choice that supports the criticism above is option E, which states that values of liberalism cannot be adequately understood if we approach them solely through the methods of Western science. This supports the criticism that the Western perspective cannot be the only perspective used when trying to understand non-Western cultures.

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although the secondary substances in plants do not take part in the plants' basic biological processes, these substances operate as natural defenses against damage and destruction by insects.
  B: Long-term competition between plants and insects has led to a narrowing of the range of secondary substances present in plants and, thus, also to a narrowing of the range of insect species that eat each species of plant.
  C: The particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of teraction between plants and insects.
  D: Due to long-term evolutionary pressures exerted by insects, the secondary substances in plants have become numerous and diverse but tend to be similar among closely related species.
  E: Because plant mutations have led to the development of secondary substances, plants have come to participate in a continuing process of competition with plant-eating insects.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: In arguing for their respective positions, the author of passage A and the author of passage B both do which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: explain a phenomenon by pointing to its biological origins

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author discusses the "cognitive framework" that jurors create (line 58) primarily to
Choices:
  A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial
  B: indicate that jurors bring into court with them certain attitudes and biases that at least in part inform their opinions during trials
  C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial
  D: theorize that stealing thunder is best done as early as possible in a case, before the opposition has an opportunity to solidify jurors' opinions
  E: speculate that creating credibility in some cases is probably more effective than positively framing very harmful information
Response 0:
Thought:
The paragraph discusses the "cognitive framework" in regards to jurors.
The author explains that jurors are likely to solidify opinions based on early information, which can influence the way they evaluate information presented later in the trial.

The last sentence of the paragraph mentions limitations of the stealing thunder technique for very damaging information.
Combining these thoughts, the author discusses the cognitive framework that jurors create primarily to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Therefore, the answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
The "cognitive framework" that jurors create is discussed in the context of stealing thunder, where negative information is revealed about a client early. 
The discussion is about how that negative information presented early could influence the juror's subsequent analysis and inform their opinions during the trial. 
Therefore, A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:

The cognitive framework is created by early negative impressions.
The cognitive framework serves as a filter for later information presented in a trial.
Therefore, the author discusses the cognitive framework created by jurors primarily to suggest that damaging evidence framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial. 
The answer is C: suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author mentions the "cognitive framework" that jurors create to suggest some limitations of "stealing thunder."
  The author explains that the "cognitive framework" jurors create can form a cognitive schema that filters information in a certain way, and this can limit the effectiveness of "stealing thunder."
  Therefore, the author discusses the cognitive framework that jurors create primarily to indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  The answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
The phrase "cognitive framework" refers to the idea that an early impression formed by jurors can influence the evaluation of information presented later in the trial.
The author discusses this to suggest how stealing thunder may impact the way jurors evaluate evidence.
Therefore, the answer is A: indicate that at least some information mentioned early in a trial can influence the way jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question asks why the author discusses the "cognitive framework" of jurors created early in the trial (line 58).
  The passage suggests that jurors create a cognitive framework based on the information introduced into the trial.
  The framework can influence how jurors evaluate information presented later in the trial.
  The discussion of cognitive framework is related to how jurors process information.
  Therefore, (A) is the best answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The paragraph discusses the "cognitive framework" jurors create and how that can influence the way they evaluate information presented later in the trial.
The preceding sentence implies that revealing negative information ("stealing thunder") early in a trial refers to the presentation of negative information early on in the trial while "framing" that information to downplay its severity, thereby creating an early positive impression.
This technique is useful when the negative information can be framed positively.
Therefore, the primary aim of discussing the "cognitive framework" that jurors create is to suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Passage B differs from passage A in that analogous displays an attitude toward the ideas it discusses that is more
Choices:
  A: engaged
  B: dismissive
  C: detached
  D: ironic
  E: skeptical
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the traditional legal idea of punishing bad actors should be abandoned in favor of deterrence, given that neuroscience shows that people's actions are not necessarily freely chosen and the law should focus on preventing future harm.
  Passage B argues that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism by making distinctions between free actions (not constrained) and constrained actions (caused by external sources). These arguments are compatible with the idea that disease-free brains can produce free actions that are not constrained.
  There are no indications in passage B that suggest the author's attitude towards the ideas they discuss more dismissive or detached than passage A. Instead, it is consistent with a skeptical attitude that critiques the deterministic view that all human actions are causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that the way we think about the law needs to change based on recent findings in neuroscience.
  Passage A proposes that the law should focus on preventing future harms rather than punishing bad people for their freely chosen immoral acts.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and determinism, proposing that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely.
  However, Passage B does not discuss the implications of this view for the law system, unlike Passage A.
  Therefore, Passage B is more focused on discussing an idea within the framework of philosophy rather than its implications for the legal system, which suggests that it is more detached.
  The answer is C: detached.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests a radical change in the law brought about by the findings of neuroscience.
  It questions the dominant justification of punishment and advocates for deterrence.
  The author of Passage A seems to agree with the deterministic view, suggesting that our actions are controlled by the operations of our brains.
  Passage B, on the other hand, discusses the coexistence of free will and determinism, citing Ayer's theory of "soft determinism."
  The author of Passage B appears to be more engaged in the discussion and presents a theory of free actions and constrained actions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests radical changes in the law viewing free and rational choices.
  Passage A proposes focusing on deterring future harms.
  Passage B proposes coexistence of free will with determinism.
  Passage B introduces Ayer's theory of "soft determinism".
  Passage B suggests that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions arising from a disease-free brain are free, even though they may be determined.
  Both passages suggest a deterministic view.
  However, Passage A suggests that retribution is not justifiable while Passage B does not take a stance.
  Passage B appears to be more engaged to Ayer's theory.
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that criminal justice should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harms based on the latest findings in neuroscience.
  Passage B talks about the concept of free will that could coexist with determinism by distinguishing between free and constrained actions.
  Passage B talks about the theory of "soft determinism" that was introduced by Alfred J. Ayer.
  There is no indication that Passage B agrees or disagrees with the ideas in Passage A. 
  Therefore, neither engaged, dismissive, ironic nor skeptical describes the attitude of Passage B towards the ideas discussed in Passage A.
  The tone of Passage B is objective, presenting a clear explanation of the theory of "soft determinism."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A criticizes the traditional view of punishment in law by arguing that brain science shows that people are not fully responsible, and that the law should focus instead on deterring future harms.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will, specifically 'soft determinism,' the idea that actions are free as long as not constrained.
  The passage doesn't seem to take a stance criticizing or dismissing either deterministic or compatibility views of free will. 
  The attitude towards the ideas in Passage B seem detached and explanatory, although the discussion is affirmative of free will.
 Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that neuroscience radically changes the way we should think about the law: it dismisses the idea of retribution and emphasizes deterrence for the future. 
  Passage B discusses Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" and distinguishes between free and constrained actions, but does not explicitly discuss the law.
  Passage B does not display attitude at all--it simply presents a philosophical argument without any emotional tone or biases.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves because their decision is beyond their control.
  It further suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution.
  Passage B discusses the concept of free will and distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. It argues that actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Passage B does not express a dismissive, detached, ironic, or skeptical attitude towards the ideas it discusses.
  Instead, it engages with and explains Ayer's theory of "soft determinism".
  Therefore, the answer is A: engaged.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses recent findings in neuroscience and their impact on the law.
  It states that the law should focus on deterring future harms rather than the idea of retribution as a justification for punishment, given that the concept of free will is questionable.
  Passage B presents Ayer's concept of "soft determinism" and defines free and constrained actions.
  It states that actions are free unless they are constrained and could argue that the brain's role in decision making does not count as constraint.
  Passage B presents ideas that differ from those presented in passage A, but it does not explicitly display an attitude toward the ideas.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses a viewpoint on the law based on neuroscience findings.
  Passage B discusses Alfred J. Ayer's theory of soft determinism using an analogy to neuroscience.
  There is no mention of an attitude of "analogous", and the question is asking about the attitude of Passage B as a whole, not of a specific term or person.
  Therefore, we should evaluate the tone of the passages to decide which one is more engaged/dismissive/detached/ironic/skeptical.
  Passage A seems to be more skeptical and dismissive of the idea of free will and the current justification for punishment in the criminal-justice system, while Passage B offers a theory of soft determinism that adds to the concept of free will.
  Thus, Passage A appears more dismissive while Passage B seems more engaged with the topic at hand. 
  The answer is A: engaged.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the attitude of Matthew Arnold toward the aristocratic and middle classes can best be described as one of
Choices:
  A: respect
  B: empathy
  C: indifference
  D: disappointment
  E: scorn

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education?
Choices:
  A: It is impossible to adopt the perspectives and methods of a culture unless one is a member of that culture.
  B: Many non-Western societies have value systems that are very similar to one another.
  C: Some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures that have different values.
  D: Students in Western societies cannot understand their culture's achievements unless such achievements are treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education, according to the passage, is that its methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western and thus not essentially different from the first. The critique argues that the Western scientific heritage has privileged discourse, which is an expression of an attempt to maintain cultural chauvinism.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would provide the strongest objection to this criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  If there is a method that allows non-Western cultures to be understood without using Western scientific methods, then the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be weakened.
  Choice A is not relevant because the passage did not address whether one must be a member of a culture to adopt its perspectives and methods.
  Choice B is not relevant to the question because the question is about the methods of understanding non-Western cultures, not the similarity of non-Western societies.
  Choice C is also not relevant to the question because it describes something that some non-Western societies do, rather than a method of understanding a non-Western culture without using Western scientific methods.
  Choice D, like Choice B, is not relevant to the question because the question is about the methods of understanding non-Western cultures; it did not address whether the achievements of a Western culture should be treated as the subject of Western scientific investigations.
  Choice E is also not relevant because it is already a belief included in the passage. It does not describe a method of understanding other cultures that does not use Western scientific methods.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The second version of multicultural education is criticized for the Western methods it uses to study other cultures.
According to the objection, it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
The question asks which choice will provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
Choice A and B are irrelevant to the argument presented.
Choice C could somewhat support the second version of multicultural education, but it is not a strong objection to the criticism presented in the passage because there is no indication that the second version of multicultural education denies the use of other value systems.
Choice D is also not relevant to the argument presented.
Choice E seems to support the objection because it argues that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Therefore, the answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is value-laden and can be seen as an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The strongest objection to this criticism would be a statement that shows that using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures does not express a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Option A is incorrect because this statement is not related to the argument of whether adopting perspectives and methods of non-Western cultures is necessary to understand them.
  Option B is not related to the argument about the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option C suggests that some non-Western societies use their own value system when studying cultures with different values, but it does not address the criticism of the second version of multicultural education.
  Option D is talking about the understanding of a Western culture and not non-Western cultures.
  Option E seems correct because genuine understanding of non-Western cultures is necessary for the purpose of multicultural education, which is promoting multicultural understanding. Therefore, it is the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it utilizes Western scientific perspectives and methods for examining and understanding non-Western cultures, which is not essentially different from the first proposal.
  According to the criticism, the methods of social scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden. Thus, adopting the value system of a culture is necessary to achieve real understanding of that culture.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism would be an argument that the scientific methods used in the second version of multicultural education are not value-laden.
  Option A is irrelevant as it states a fact but does not relate to the argument.
  Option B is not related to the argument.
  Option C does not provide a strong objection as this is already being done under the second form of multicultural education.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the argument made. 
  Option E does not provide a strong objection as it is already a given premise that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
  The only option that relates to the argument and provides a strong objection is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first because it employs Western scientific methods to examine and understand other cultures.
  To defend the second version of multicultural education, we need to show that the criticism is incorrect.
  The objection is that scientific methods are already value-laden, so using them to understand other cultures is an attempt to maintain Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the strongest objection would be one that refutes this objection by showing that using Western scientific methods is not inherently Eurocentric or value-laden.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is still fundamentally Western.
  Critics argue that non-Western cultures should be understood on their own terms.
  According to the critics, the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are value-laden and distorting.
  The passage implies that to successfully understand non-Western cultures, one must adopt their perspectives and methods of examination.
  Among the choices, only one establishes that the methods of examination developed in the West could not be the lens through which the majority culture in the West could understand the cultural perspectives of non-Western cultures.
  This choice suggests that the West would have to rely on the perspectives and methods of the studied cultures to understand those cultures.
  Therefore, the best answer is E: Genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education states that adopting Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures is problematic.
  The objection is that the choice of using Western scientific methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  To overcome this objection, something needs to establish that using Western scientific methods does not involve necessarily committing to certain values.
  Option A does not address the objection of the passage. 
  Option B is incorrect, as even if some non-Western societies share similar values, they still cannot be understood appropriately using only Western scientific methods. 
  Option C partially addresses the objection. However, it is not clear enough for the statement to provide the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education. 
  Option D does not address the objection of the passage and is irrelevant to the topic. 
  Option E also does not address the objection of the passage, but its statement is consistent with proponents of multicultural education.
  Hence, option C provides the strongest objection among all others.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it still uses Western scientific methods that are often value-laden and distorting when examining other cultures. 
  The objection to this criticism is that real understanding of another culture requires adopting the methods and perspectives of the culture studied.
  Therefore, the strongest objection would be the one that directly supports the claim that it is necessary to adopt the methods and perspectives of the culture studied.
  Answer E directly supports this claim by stating that genuine understanding of another culture is necessary for adequately appreciating that culture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The criticism stated against the second version of multicultural education asserts that it is not possible to understand other cultures by using Western scientific perspectives and methods to examine them.
  The objection to this states that real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of the non-scientific cultures being studied.
  To provide the strongest objection to the criticism in the passage of the second version of multicultural education, we need an option that shows that it is, in fact, possible to understand other cultures through Western scientific perspectives and methods or that the objection itself is incorrect.
  Option A does not invalidate the criticism, which is not about the ability to adopt a culture's perspective and methods.
  Option B is irrelevant to the issue under consideration and does not address the criticism or the objection to it.
  Option C, while talking about non-Western societies using their own values while studying other cultures, does not provide any support to show that an objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education is invalid.
  Option D is irrelevant to the issue at hand and does not address the criticism or the objection to it.
  Option E, while essential to the discussion of genuine understanding, and is not directly relevant to the given question.
  None of the options show that the objection is incorrect. Hence, the answer is "None of the above."
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
The criticism of the second version of multicultural education says that it is Eurocentric because it uses Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
The response to this criticism argues that it's impossible to fully understand a culture via their methods because it's "value-laden". It's better to approach each culture on its own terms.
To object this criticism, the best statement would be the one that argues that it's possible to understand non-Western cultures using their methods. 
Options A and B are not related to this argument. 
Option C mentions that some non-western cultures use their own value systems when studying others, but it doesn't suggest that it's possible to understand other cultures with different methods. 
Option D is talking about Western scientific investigation which is already a part of the problem and doesn't address the root of the objection. 
Option E is a general statement that supports multicultural education but doesn't address the criticism.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The passage most strongly suggests which one of the following about the use of proverbs?
Choices:
  A: Proverb use is seldom intended to reinforce community-approved norms.
  B: The way in which a proverb is used depends, at least in part, on the community in which it is used.
  C: The most frequent use of proverbs in Mexican American communities is for the purpose of regulating peer-group relationships.
  D: Proverbs are often used to help teach young people languages.
  E: When a proverb is used as an educational tool, it is usually intended to serve more than one purpose.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in line 54?
Choices:
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor
  B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage highlights the emotional depth of Schoenberg's music that had never been recorded before, which made it so unique and essential.
  The passage further states that some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths. 
  So, something that unflinchingly faces difficult truths, similar to Schoenberg's work, could be compared to it.
  Out of the given choices, option B seems plausible since it highlights the comedian's ability to shed light on difficult human truths that many people avoid.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that some of Schoenberg's work remains disturbing because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before".
  Schoenberg's music is not disturbing because it is vulgar, unoriginal, or unfamiliar.
  Schoenberg's music is also not disturbing because of an extreme political philosophy.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses how Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it "delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
Therefore, we are looking for a comedian whose material similarly "delineates recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states" that comedy had not explored before.
Choice A is not analogous because the humor is "vulgar" rather than "disquieting".
Choice C is not analogous because it is not exploring new emotional territory. 
Choice D is not analogous because it describes a comedian's "political philosophy" rather than the emotional material explored in the comedy. 
Choice E could be seen as similar, but it does not specify that the unfamiliar style of humor is exploring "recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states". 
Choice B is the best answer because it describes a comedian who is exploring emotional aspects of human nature that people would prefer to ignore. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage describes Schoenberg's music as disturbing in a specific way.
  The reason for the disturbing aspects of Schoenberg's work is because it expresses difficult truths.
  In order to find an answer to this question, we need to find something that disturbs its audience because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
  Answer B describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, and therefore, could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that the disturbing nature of some of Schoenberg's work arises from its precision in recording emotional states that music has not recorded before.
  The option that best matches this characteristic is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  In this case, the comedian's disturbing material is not disturbing for the vulgar references, extreme political philosophy, or unfamiliarity to the audience, but for the questions and issues it raises about human nature.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it delves into difficult emotional states that music had not previously recorded.
  The question is about something else that is "disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing" in line 54.
  The most similar option would be a comedian who can tap into and examine uncomfortable truths.
  Option B says "a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore" which is most likely the answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage says that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  It can be inferred that something that is similarly disturbing would also precisely delineate recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that the medium it uses has not recorded before.
  Among the choices, the one that comes closest to the comparison is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The correct answer choice should describe something that is disturbing because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths and pushes boundaries.
  Comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor (A), whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians (C), whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy (D), and whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience (E) do not necessarily unflinchingly face difficult truths.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore (B) could be said to be disturbing in a way that is most analogous to the way that Schoenberg's music is said to be disturbing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
 The passage states that Schoenberg's music is "disturbing" because it "precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before."
 This suggests that the answer choice that most closely matches Schoenberg's music would be something that similarly deals with emotional states in a way that is new or uncomfortable.
 Out of these answer choices, the one that is closest is B: "a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage explains why Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
  According to the passage, Schoenberg's music is disturbing because he created recognizable and disquieting emotional states that were not recorded before.
  The passage is not discussing anything about comedians.
  Therefore, we need to look for the most analogous type of work that expresses new and difficult truths.
  The closest option is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

Topic: Law
Context: Many educators in Canada and the United States advocate multicultural education as a means of achieving multicultural understanding. There are, however, a variety of proposals as to what multicultural education should consist of. The most modest of these proposals holds that schools and colleges should promote multicultural understanding by teaching about other cultures, teaching which proceeds from within the context of the majority culture. Students should learn about other cultures, proponents claim, but examination of these cultures should operate with the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture. These values are typically those of liberalism: democracy, tolerance, and equality of persons. Critics of this first proposal have argued that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective. Not all cultures share liberal values. Their value systems have arisen in often radically different social and historical circumstances, and thus, these critics argue, cannot be understood and adequately appreciated if one insists on approaching them solely from within the majority culture's perspective. In response to this objection, a second version of multicultural education has developed that differs from the first in holding that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. The values of one culture should not be standards by which others are judged; each culture should be taken on its own terms. However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western. They are the methods of anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology. They are, that is, methods which derive from the Western scientific perspective and heritage. Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue as follows: The Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical. The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity. Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first. Scientific discourse has a privileged place in Western cultures, but the discourses of myth, tradition, religion, and mystical insight are often the dominant forms of thought and language of non-Western cultures. To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the (often nonscientific) perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following would most likely be considered objectionable by proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph?
Choices:
  A: a study of the differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies
  B: a study of a given culture's literature to determine the kinds of personal characteristics the culture admires
  C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture
  D: a study that uses the literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values
  E: a study that uses the methods of anthropology and sociology to criticize the values of Western culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  According to the critics of the second version of multicultural education, the Western scientific method is inherently value-laden and not suitable for understanding non-Western cultures.
  Therefore, what proponents of the second version of multicultural education are most likely to object to is the use of Western scientific methods to investigate a nonscientific culture.
  The answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education that takes a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures. They believe each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  However, using Western scientific methods to examine and understand non-Western cultures is considered objectionable.
  The study of literature to determine personal characteristics is not mentioned in the passage.
  A study of differences between the moral codes of several Western and non-Western societies can provide a comparison between different cultures, but it does not necessarily mean the methods of Western science are employed. Therefore, it may or may not be objectionable.
  A study that critiques the literature of a society with different values using another society’s literary theories is not related to using Western scientific methods to understand non-Western cultures.
  Only C relates to the objection discussed in the third paragraph that using Western scientific methods to examine non-Western cultures is inadequate for genuine understanding. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The third paragraph talks about the second version of multicultural education being neutral in terms of not judging cultures through the values of another culture.
  However, this version of multicultural education still uses Western methods of science to study non-Western cultures.
  Critics argue that Western methods of science are value-laden and that understanding of non-scientific cultures can only be achieved by adopting their own methods of study.
  Therefore, a study that employs Western scientific methods to investigate a non-scientific culture is most likely to be considered objectionable by proponents of the second version of multicultural education.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses the objection raised by critics of the second version of multicultural education which advocates for examination of other cultures through neutral methods of Western social sciences, such as anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  The critics argue that such methods are already value-laden and not essentially different from the first version of multicultural education that seeks to examine other cultures through the methods, perspectives, and values of the majority culture, which is typically liberal.
  Thus, proponents of the third version of multicultural education would likely object to Western science being used to study and investigate nonscientific cultures.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The third paragraph describes the second version of multicultural education which advocates for a neutral approach towards value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination and study of cultures in this version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western such as those found in anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics of this version argue that Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective, the logical and the empirically verifiable over the mystical, myth, tradition and religion.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden and involve a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  Therefore, it is likely that proponents of this version of multicultural education would consider the study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a non-scientific culture as objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The third paragraph discusses a version of Multicultural Education different from the first two.
  According to the passage, the second version of multicultural education involves a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  Although the second version of multicultural education adopts a neutral stance towards other cultures, the methods of examination, study, and explanation used in this version are still identifiably Western.
  In contrast, critics argue that an attempt to understand non-scientific cultures by the methods of Western science is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Therefore, the third paragraph would likely find the use of Western science methods in studying non-scientific cultures objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The third paragraph talks about the objection of critics towards the second version of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education advocates for a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  The methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in the second version are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the commitment to Western scientific methods of examination involves a commitment to certain values.
  Critics maintain that to understand non-scientific cultures, it is necessary to adopt their perspectives and methods, 
      instead of trying to understand them through Western scientific methods.
  Option A is not objectionable according to the passage because it does not relate to non-scientific cultures or Western scientific methods.
  Option B is not objectionable because it uses the method of studying literature to determine the characteristics admired by a culture. 
      It doesn't involve adopting Western scientific methods.
  Option C is objectionable because it proposes using the Western scientific method to investigate non-scientific cultures.
  Option D is not objectionable because it proposes using literary theories of one culture to criticize the literature of another culture.
      It doesn't involve adopting Western scientific methods or involve non-scientific cultures.
  Option E is not objectionable because it proposes using Western scientific methods to criticize Western culture, not any non-scientific culture.
  
Therefore, the answer is C: a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The third paragraph of the passage discusses a second proposal for multicultural education where cultural values are not considered standards to be judged and the examination of cultures is approached in a neutral stance.
  This second version of multicultural education still employs Western methods of examination such as anthropology, social psychology, political science, and sociology.
  Critics of this second proposal argue that Western scientific heritage is already value-laden which causes a chauvinism of science.
  They believe that understanding other cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric culture.
  Therefore, a study that employs the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture would most likely be considered objectionable.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first version of multicultural education proposes examining cultures within the context of the majority culture and using the values of liberalism in examination.
  Critics of the first version argue that the method is flawed because understanding of other cultures is impossible if only examined through the perspective of the majority culture and liberal values.
  The second version of multicultural education proposes taking each culture on its own terms but still using Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures.
  Critics of the second version argue that the method is flawed because the methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are already value-laden, and to try to understand non-scientific cultures by Western science methods is an expression of Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  The question asks for what the proponents of the version of multicultural education discussed in the third paragraph would OBJECT to. 
  Based on the information, the proponents of this third proposal would likely object to using the methods of Western science to investigate a nonscientific culture as it is an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism, according to the objection in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The third paragraph describes the second version of multicultural education and criticizes it.
  The second version of multicultural education employs a neutral stance.
  The second version of multicultural education still uses Western scientific perspective and heritage.
  Critics view the second version as an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Real understanding can only be achieved by adopting the perspectives and methods of other cultures studied.
  The answer will describe something that proponents of the second version of multicultural education would see as objectionable.
  Choice A does not involve the second version of multicultural education but a study of the differences between several Western and non-Western moral codes.
  Choice B is not objectionable because it uses the context of the given culture to determine personal characteristics.
  Choice C is the correct answer because the second version of multicultural education is criticized for using Western scientific perspective which is an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism.
  Choice D uses literary theories of one society to criticize the literature of a society that has different values which is not contradicting the second version of multicultural education.
  Choice E does not involve the second version of multicultural education either, but a criticism of the values of Western culture.

Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: The passage provides the most support for inferring which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez" was rarely sung at Border social gatherings.
  B: Most surviving corridos do not exist in complete form.
  C: All complete corridos have some lines in common.

Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: The Mexican American tradition of Spanish-language proverb use differs in important ways from the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  B: Spanish-language proverbs figure prominently in Mexican American communities, where they are used both to instruct the young and to promote the young's familiarity with their heritage.
  C: Most proverbs that are commonly used in Mexican American communities have their origins in either peninsular Spain or the common proverb tradition of Europe.
  D: Many people in Mexican American communities use proverbs to teach young people about a wide range of social behaviors and norms.
  E: As is illustrated in the Spanish-language tradition, the use of proverbs can serve a wide range of purposes within a community.

Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be LEAST likely to agree with which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: The presence of certain abnormally shaped prions in brain tissue is a sign of neurological disease.
  B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  C: Prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  D: The body has no natural defense against CJD.
  E: Scientists have only a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses extensively the danger posed by prion infections.
  It concludes that prions are a completely new class of infectious pathogens and that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  Choice B does not agree with the information presented in the passage because it states that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease while the passage indicates that CJD is inevitably fatal.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author provides information about Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the discovery of prions.
  The author provides evidence that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it can be inferred that some patients currently infected with CJD will not recover from the disease.
  The author explains how prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. It is explained that prions do not require nucleic acid for their reproduction.
  The author also explains that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and unlike other pathogens, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. The author concludes that there is no effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction. It can be inferred that the author thinks that the body does not have a natural defense against CJD.
  The author acknowledges that there is a partial understanding of the mechanism by which prions reproduce.
  Therefore, the author would be LEAST likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease because they explain it is inevitably fatal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes CJD as inevitably fatal.
  The passage also describes prions as being capable of reproducing themselves.
  The passage mentions that prions occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  The passage also mentions that prions cause neurodegenerative diseases such as CJD, and possibly Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.
  The author would be least likely to agree with a statement that contradicts any of these points.
  Choice B, which suggests some patients recover from CJD, directly contradicts the passage. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage explains that CJD is a fatal disease, there are no effective treatments, and there is no natural immune response to prions in the body.
  The passage also states that the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction are not completely understood.
  The passage does not provide any information that would suggest that any patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
There is no information in the passage that indicates some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease. The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal, so it would be least likely that the author agrees with this statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage states that CJD is inevitably fatal with no known therapy.
  It is unlikely that the passage would support the statement that some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease.
  The other options are mentioned or implied in the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
- The passage describes CJD as inevitably fatal, so the author would be unlikely to agree with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage states that the disease caused by abnormal prions is inevitably fatal, so it is unlikely that the author would agree with choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The author of the passage provides a detailed explanation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and the characteristics of prions.
  The author specifically notes that CJD is inevitably fatal, lacks effective therapy, and produces no immune response.
  Inference questions ask for an answer choice that the author would LEAST likely agree with.
  Accordingly, the correct answer choice is likely to be one that contradicts the author's explanation of CJD.
  Answer choice B contradicts the author's explanation of CJD and is therefore the least likely to be agreed on.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage describes CJD as a deadly disease.
  The passage also describes prions as a new class of infectious pathogens without nucleic acids.
  It suggests that prions possess the capability of transforming normal cellular proteins into abnormal, pathogenic ones, leading to plaque formation in brain tissues that then causes nerve cell death.
  The passage also indicates that prions can exist as proteins in many of the body's tissues without producing an immune response.
  Given this, the author would be least likely to agree with B: Some patients currently infected with CJD will recover from the disease, since the passage describes the disease as inevitably fatal with wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and how aggressively the disease progresses.

Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: The explanation of the utility maximization principle in the passage suggests that which one of the following would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives?
Choices:
  A: In order to reduce his taxes, a waiter conceals a large part of his tip income from the government because he believes that it is very unlikely that this will be detected and he will be penalized.
  B: A motorist avoids speeding on a certain stretch of road because she knows that it is heavily patrolled and that a speeding ticket will lead to loss of her driver's license.
  C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  D: A government official in an impoverished country risks prosecution for soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  E: A worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle suggests that a person commits a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of being detected, exceeds the expected utility from lawful activity.
  The principle looks at utility (satisfaction) of the possible outcomes of committing or not committing a crime.
  So, based on the utility maximization principle, a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is committing a crime with the expectation that the outcome will increase overall satisfaction.
  The passage is focused on deliberate crimes that are analyzed through the utility maximization principle.
  Options A, B, C, and D all include examples of individuals who commit deliberate crimes as a result of rational economic decisions made by weighing the benefits and costs of those actions.
  Option E, however, describes a person who reacts impulsively to being dismissed from a job and acts violently on the spur of the moment. It does not include a rational economic decision-making process that considers the benefits and costs of the action.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle asserts that a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  A person's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The least rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be one where the expected utility from the potential outcomes of that action is weighted and the outcome with an unfavorable result is selected more frequently without much thought given to the long-term payoffs and risks.
  Option E seems to be the least rationally thought out scenario. The desire to physically assault someone in an irrational state to address a work-related dispute lacks the economic utility calculation all others demonstrate.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage explains the utility maximization principle as the economic principle that rational individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  This decision-making process involves weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes and calculating each outcome's probability of happening.
  Therefore, a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is the one that will result in greater overall satisfaction.
  Options A, B, C, and D describe behaviors that are likely a result of a person's calculations based on anticipated rewards and potential punishment.
  However, the option E describes a violent response that appears to be impulsive and not based on rational decision making.
  Therefore, option E would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that a person responds rationally to economic incentives and disincentives to commit a crime.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Therefore, the person who would be least appropriately described as a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives to commit a crime is the person whose action cannot be explained in terms of the expected utility calculation.
  Choice E describes a person who commits an impulsive crime out of anger and revenge, not as a result of expected utility maximization, when finding himself dismissed from his former job.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The question asks to identify the least appropriate rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
Appropriate rational responses to economic incentives involve the rational assessments of the costs and benefits of different courses of actions.
Option A presents a waiter concealing a large part of his tip income to reduce his tax liabilities, which is an economically rational decision. 
Option B also presents a motorist avoiding speeding on a certain stretch of the road to avoid getting an expensive speeding ticket and potential loss of driving privileges, which is an economically rational decision.
Option C presents an industrialist continuing to illegally discharge pollutants into the river because the cost of treatment exceeds the penalty for illegal discharge. This is an economically rational decision.
Option D presents a government official soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered their salary incapable of supporting themselves and their family. This is an economically rational decision.
In option E, the worker physically assaults their former supervisor, which is not an economically rational decision since it involves engaging in a violent act that has the potential to lead to negative financial, legal, and social consequences for the worker.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is asking what does not appropriately describe a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  The economic principle of utility maximization suggests that people make rational decisions based on the perceived costs and benefits of an action.
  Option A describes a worker who conceals tip income to avoid paying taxes.
  Option B describes a motorist who does not speed on a patrolled road to avoid losing her license.
  Option C describes an industrialist who continues to pollute because the cost of treatment is higher than the cost of the fine.
  Option D describes a government official who risks prosecution for corruption due to inadequate pay.
  Option E describes a worker who physically assaults a former supervisor due to feelings of unfair dismissal.
  All except option E describe a rational economic decision that involves the expected utility of the outcome.
  Option E describes an impulsive emotional action regardless of economic disincentives.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that a rational response to economic incentives or disincentives means maximizing their anticipated satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  All of the choices seem like they could be rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives.
  However, the industrialist, unlike the other choices, continues to commit a crime despite the knowledge that the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging pollutants.
  This behavior shows little regard for the potential negative outcomes, and therefore it cannot be the product of a rational response to economic incentives/disincentives.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response would be C: An industrialist continues to illegally discharge an untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle demonstrates that a person will respond rationally to incentives or disincentives in order to maximize their overall satisfaction or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's probability of occurrence, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  All the answer options involve a rational economic choice based on incentives or disincentives.
  Given the economic principle of utility maximization all answers choices are likely to be rational.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The utility maximization principle states that individuals choose the action that maximizes their anticipated satisfaction/expected utility.
  Anticipated satisfaction is determined by weighing utilities of possible outcomes by the likelihood of each outcome and adding them up.
  Rational (as opposed to impulsive) responses to economic incentives and disincentives are used to maximize utility.
  A, B, C, and D involve rational responses to incentives while E is impulsive.
  The least rational action is E since it appears that it was a result of the worker's emotional response to his dismissal.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The utility maximization principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them based on the likelihood of each outcome's occurrence, and then summing up those weighted utilities.
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, a rational response to incentives and disincentives is one that maximizes an individual's overall satisfaction (or expected utility).
  Option A describes an instance where a person is responding rationally to economic incentives and disincentives, as he/she is concealing income to reduce taxes, despite the potential consequences.
  Option B describes another rational response, where a motorist avoids speeding because of the potential loss of her driver's license, which would reduce her overall satisfaction.
  Similarly, Option C presents a case where an industrialist is acting in a rational manner by choosing not to discharge the pollutant illegally as the cost of treatment outweighs the benefit of discharge.
  Option D describes an example where a government official is taking a rational course of action by soliciting bribes as her government salary is not enough to support her and her family.
  However, physical assault, described in Option E, in response to a dismissal from a job is not a rational response to the economic disincentive of losing one's job. It does not maximize the person's overall satisfaction or expected utility.

Topic: Law
Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the relationships between the three styles in which Schoenberg wrote?
Choices:
  A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
  B: Each successive style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the previous one.
  C: The second style represents a natural progression from the first, but the third style represents an inexplicable departure from the second.

  E: The second style represents an inexplicabledeparture from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the first.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions three different musical styles in which Arnold Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style was late-Romantic with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style went beyond tonal basis, and the third style was Schoenberg's development of the 12-tone technique.
  The author talks about how Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery in all three styles, and the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree that each style represents a natural progression from the previous one. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles. 
  The author views Schoenberg's technical mastery in all three styles as awe-inspiring. 
  The author suggests that Schoenberg's music provides emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The passage does not provide any indication that each of the three styles represents an inexplicable departure or a natural progression from the previous one.
  Based on the information given, the author's view seems to be that each style serves a particular purpose in Schoenberg's evolution as a composer. 
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
Schoenberg's first style was a music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies which were unstable.
In his second style, he pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
It can be inferred that the author would agree each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one as he describes the evolution of each style in the passage.
Therefore, the answer is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage mentions that in the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved, he worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. 
The passage also mentions that Schoenberg pushed the unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and that his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow.
The author mentions that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. 
Given that the author acknowledges Schoenberg's evolving style, the answer choice that best captures this idea is A: Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that Schoenberg's music evolved over time.
  Schoenberg began with late-Romantic manner (shifting chromatic harmonies) and progressed to an atonal style.
  Finally, Schoenberg developed the 12-tone technique, which brought a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilized it.
  Each successive style represents a change, however, the author's tone is not negative towards the changes.
  From the passage, it seems that the author appreciates Schoenberg's music despite the difficulties of following it.
  The author also admires Schoenberg's technical mastery.
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree with choice (A) Each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Historically, art was primarily commissioned by the governing classes and the well-to-do middle classes,despite the fact that this arrangement was not apt to produce art that endures.
  B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
  C: Historically, patrons of the arts have generally been more interested in what being a patron would do for their reputation than in influencing the development of the arts.
  D: Sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify, in light of apparently conflicting evidence, the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elite.
  E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage offers a critical view of sociohistorical interpretations of art. It mentions the two ways in which art was produced by the elite, and challenges the claim that art produced this way reflects the ideals and way of life of the elite class. It discusses how socio-historical critics deal with art that embodies the ideology of the elite and mentions how the two social classes - the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, commissioned art. It also talks about the flaws of these classes in producing art that endures. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage starts with a discussion of the production of art by a class, dominated by ruling or governing/wealthier classes.
  The passage then describes two ways that historically art was produced by the elites.
  The second way involves art that expressed and mirrored the ideals and way of life of the elites.
  The text explains that it may be problematic to analyze these kinds of productions of art because the elites may not necessarily have had a recognizable identity and consensus about the world.
  The text also suggests that some of the more talented artists sometimes had to find eccentric patrons to support their work.
  The sociohistorical critic like Taruskin tries to analyze the art produced by the elites and argues that even the non-classical art produced by elites embodies the ideals of the elites.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two ways that members of the elite classes have had art produced for them, and the sociohistorical analysis of the art produced by elites is a complex process.
  The answer is E: There have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
 The passage discusses the history of art and its production by the governing and well-to-do middle classes.
 The gripe the critics have is about the nature of the art and the fact that it reflected the patron rather than the artist.
 The type of art that patrons produced mirrored their ideals and way of life, and social classes such as aristocracy and the middle class tended to commission art.
 Matthew Arnold, however, identified these classes as barbarians and philistines with interests not quite in sync with producing art.
 These artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment with rich patrons with eccentric tastes.
 However, over time, some of this non-conforming art endured, although there were misgivings.
 The sociohistorical critic like Taruskin is interested in this art that went against elite values, making analogies and justifications to the claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage discusses two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
The first way was to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
The sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with the second way to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
Some of this art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them and sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elites. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses different ways in which historical elites commissioned art.
  It examines the sociohistorical interpretation that art was produced to reflect the ideology of elites.
  It also argues that this interpretation requires the existence of a coherent elite ideology, and that certain art may subvert elite ideology.
  In addition, it examines the limitations of historical elites in commissioning art and suggests the limitations on their ability to produce enduring art.
  As such, the main point of the passage is about the limitations and complexities of interpreting art commissioned by historical elites.
  The answer is B: Sociohistorical interpretations of art that claim that art merely reflects the ideals and values of the elite classes are overly simplistic.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage describes how art historically was produced by members of the elite classes. It goes on to explain two different ways that art was produced in this context. It also describes how artists had to find ways of creating art that went against the grain of elite values. Finally, the passage discusses how sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis.
Action: Answer("E")  
The main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the ways art was traditionally produced by and for political and social elites, including the role of the elites and artists in the production of such art.
  The passage also discusses the challenges in analyzing such art and the complexity of understanding the relationship between the ideals of the patron and the artist and the works they produced.
  The main point is discussing the way art was produced by the elites and sociohistorical interpretations of such art, including the challenges inherent in analyzing the relationship between the patron and the artist in producing that art.

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following phrases best conveys the author's attitude toward the earlier scholarship on Native American autobiographies that is mentioned in the passage?
Choices:
  A: "failed to address" (line 9)
  B: "highly diverse" (line 10)
  C: "markedly inclusive" (line 16)
  D: "seemingly more fragmented" (line 24)
  E: "alien to the European style" (line 51)

Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following best captures the author's attitude toward Lichtenstein's work?
Choices:
  A: enthusiasm for its more rebellious aspects
  B: respect for its successful parody of youth and innocence
  C: pleasure in its blatant rejection of abstract expressionism

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power?
Choices:
  A: In some industries, there are businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  B: As the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  C: When an industry is dominated by only a few players, these businesses often collude in order to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  E: If a business has very specialized workers, any gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized are offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
Response 0:
Thought:
   The question is asking for a statement that would weaken the link between increasing size and monopoly, which has been discussed in the context of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
   The passage argues that the tendency towards monopoly is created by the natural inclination of large businesses to drive smaller businesses out of the industry with superior economies of scale established through specialization. 
   Options A, C, and E do not relate to the size of the business, and therefore would have no bearing on the relationship between increased size and monopoly power. 
   Option B suggests that increasing specialization may have consequences outside producing more units. It recognizes that, while specialization may increase productivity, there are negative impacts on salary rates, implying the specialization being negated or limited via other means.
   Option D, however, raises a specific concern about the variety of relationships between size and returns to scale across the industries. If there are differences in the size necessary for increased economies of scale between different fields, then larger businesses would not necessarily dominate and push smaller businesses out of the industry. This would weaken the notion that increased size inevitably leads to monopolization.
Conclusion: 
   Option D gives an explanation which contradicts the claim that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business based only on economies of scale. Thus, undermining the argument that increased scale leads to monopolistic forces. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author also argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, and only in the late 1970s did increasing returns surface into the mainstream of economic thought.
  So, the answer choice that would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power would imply that either increasing returns to scale do not tend to lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, or that the assumption of diminishing returns did not dominate economic theory for two centuries.
  Answer choice (A) suggests that there may be reasons to explain why some businesses in the same industry are able to exert monopoly power while larger businesses are not. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (B) addresses the effects of specialization on salaries, but it does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (C) suggests that even where an industry is dominated by only a few players, they cannot necessarily exert monopoly power because they often collude. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (D) acknowledges that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This implies that increasing returns may not directly lead to monopoly, thereby undermining the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  Therefore, Answer("D") is the correct answer. 
  Answer choice (E) discusses factors that could offset the gains in productivity achieved by making workers more specialized but does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
Response 2:
Thought:
To undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power, it would need to be the case that increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power. 
A and C describe scenarios where there is a degree of monopoly power.
B and E describe factors that limit the productivity gains associated with increased size.
D suggests the size required to achieve increasing returns varies widely, which does not contradict the idea of increasing returns leading to lower costs for larger businesses.
Therefore, the best answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author argues that increased size could lead to a monopoly; 
  The Pin Factory theory illustrates the struggle between increasing returns and diminishing returns When we apply increasing returns to a business, it tends to dominate smaller businesses, leading to monopoly power. Diminishing returns work against the tendency towards monopoly, enabling several competitors to exist.
  Therefore, in answering this question, we need to find an option that presents a context where increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  Option D suggests that the scale of business required to achieve increasing returns varies from industry to industry. The realization of increasing returns may not be proportional to the size of the business, making it difficult for one business to dominate others easily regardless of their size. Thus option D undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The connection that the author draws is that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business due to increasing returns to scale which favors monopoly power.
  If there are larger businesses in the same industry but smaller businesses can still exert monopoly power in some regions, this would weaken the connection.
  Option A states exactly this, so it could be the answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs. 
  But the invisible hand is countered by natural monopolies because there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory.
  Thus, any answer that suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is weakened would likely try to show that natural monopolies or decreasing returns to scale are not necessarily linked.
  Answer choice (A) suggests that larger businesses do not always have lower costs or higher profitability than smaller businesses, which could cast doubt on the relationship between size and monopoly.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power because a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  To avoid monopoly power, the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody has monopoly power.
  The passage suggests that if increasing returns to scale vary widely from industry to industry, it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business. 
  This is because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  The connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the assumption of increasing returns. 
  If the assumption of increasing returns is undermined, it would also undermine the connection. 
  Option A, C, and E do not provide any evidence to counter the assumption of increasing returns and its connection to monopoly power. 
  Option D only provides that the size required to achieve increasing returns varies from industry to industry. 
  Option B, however, provides that as the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks. 
  This suggests that there are diminishing returns to specialization and increased size, which would undermine the assumption of increasing returns. 
  Therefore, B would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopoly, which is a problem for the invisible hand to work properly. Therefore, the connection between increased size and monopoly power should exist in a situation of increasing returns to scale. If there is any evidence that such a connection does not exist, then this would undermine the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author states that increasing returns create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author notes that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  If one industry is dominated by large businesses, then these businesses may have the ability to exert monopoly power.
  
  A: This statement only mentions that businesses can exert monopoly power in one geographical region. This doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  C: This statement supports the argument made by the author that increasing returns lead to monopoly power. Hence, it doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This statement shows that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that increasing returns to scale may not always lead to monopoly power. 
  E: This statement suggests that there may be other factors at play that limit the benefits of increasing specialization. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that one cannot always achieve increased returns to scale by increasing specialization.

Therefore, D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: According to the passage, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed
Choices:
  A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals
  B: realism is unequal to the task of representing political views

Topic: Law
Context: Hundreds of clay tablets marked in cuneiform have been found in excavations of the Sumerian city of Uruk (in present-day Iraq). Though the tablets date from roughly 3000 B.C., the writing on them uses relatively few pictographs; instead, numerous abstract symbols are used. The sign for "sheep," for example, is not an image of a sheep, but rather a circled cross, while the sign for "metal" is a crescent with five lines. Because of its early date, this seemingly sudden appearance of such abstract writing has long puzzled researchers. At the same time, among prepottery clay artifacts found at archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are thousands of small, hand-modeled tokens of fired clay, some dating to before 4000 B.C. Often ignored by archaeologists-some concluded without evidence that they were amulets or game pieces-the tokens are identified by Denise Schmandt-Besserat in her book Before Writing (1992) as overlooked predecessors to the written word. The earliest of the tokens were simple in form-small cones, spheres, and pyramids-and they were often inscribed. In 1966, a hollow tablet containing several of these tokens was discovered, and more than 100 additional tablets, which are now recognized as sealed envelopes of clay, have since been found. Later envelopes are also inscribed with impressions of tokens in the outer clay, signaling exactly what each envelope contained. Noting that these inscriptions are clearly traceable to later, known inscriptions of farm products, Schmandt-Besserat theorizes that the envelopes contained official records of villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools. After 4000 B.C., hundreds of new token forms developed, as a rise in industry boosted the token system. Many forms are figurative, such as bowls or jars with handles, suggesting that villagers' crafts were becoming more diversified and sophisticated. The token system, essentially a system of three-dimensional nouns, was replaced in about 3 1 00 B.C.by a system of marks on clay tablets. A few centuries later, this latter system was to display the first use of numerals, where simple marks coded the concepts of one, two, and so forth. The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing, Schmandt-Besserat suggests, can be seen in the following example: At first it took two ovoid tokens to record two jars of oil. A little later, it took two markings on a clay tablet to achieve this-one mark, using the outline of the old token, to record the customary unit measure for oil, the jarful, and a second mark to convey the numeral: two oil jars. Eventually, it took three signs on the tablet, one for the numeral 2, one for the standard jarful, and a new symbol that denoted oil itself. With three such signs, an abstract and flexible written form had arrived.
Question: The passage stat es that the writing on clay tablets found in Uruk
Choices:
  A: was not deciphered by archaeologists until 1992

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: Which one of the following is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B?
Choices:
  A: repudiating an experimental result
  B: revising a theory
  C: disproving a theory
  D: predicting a planet's orbit
  E: theories that are not testable by experiment
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's ideas on scientific research.
  Passage B illustrates the process of revising a theory.
  When astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus, their predictions failed which led them to revise their theory about the existence of other planets.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A explained Popper's philosophy of science and the need for theories to be testable through negative evidence, which involves looking for evidence that will disprove a theory.
  Passage B talks about astronomers predicting the orbit of Uranus and Mercury based on theories and auxiliary assumptions. 
  Their predictions were incorrect, and they had to revise their assumptions.
  So, the answer must be a choice that explains a scenario where scientists or astronomers make predictions based on theories and assumptions, and end up having to revise those theories or assumptions.
  Choice D: predicting a planet's orbit perfectly fits with the situation described in Passage B.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A talks about Karl Popper's main contribution to philosophy of science which is the power of negative evidence.
  Positive evidence has no value as evidence and negative evidence is tantamount to disproof -- this is what Popper maintains.
  Popper also believes that scientific research involves not only generating bold theories but also searching evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B talks about predictions made by astronomers based on Newton's laws and also auxiliary assumptions which helped predict the orbit of planets.
  Although the astronomers failed in their predictions, they were able to revise their theory of existence of planets to account for inaccuracies in prediction.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")

Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about Popper’s philosophy of science and his emphasis on negative evidence in scientific research.
  Passage B provides two examples where astronomers predicted the orbits of planets, but there was a problem with the prediction, requiring the scientists to revise their previous auxiliary assumptions to fit the observations.
  Therefore, the answer should be an example of revising a scientific theory, and it should be illustrated in passage B.
  Option B ("revising a theory") is mentioned in passage A and illustrated in passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A talks about Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science and his view on scientific research involving generating bold theories and searching for evidence that would disprove them which captures the situation in Passage B.
  Passage B illustrates how astronomers predicted the orbits of Uranus and Mercury which did not match with their observations. After their predictions failed, they revised their auxiliary assumptions to match their calculations with their observations.
  Therefore, the answer to the question is B: revising a theory.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A talks about Karl Popper's contribution to the philosophy of science and his views on the significance of negative evidence and the importance of searching for evidence that would disprove a theory.

  They changed their assumptions, hypothesized another planet, and called it Neptune. This led to the successful reconciliation of their calculations with the observed orbit of Uranus.
Action: Answer("B")  
The correct answer is B: revising a theory.
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's views on scientific research and the power of negative evidence.
  It describes how scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them.
  Passage B illustrates a case where astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws, but found the prediction to be incorrect.
  They revised their auxiliary assumptions, assuming the existence of another planet in its vicinity, which was later discovered to be Neptune.
  Then, the passage describes how scientists predicted the orbit of Mercury based on Newton's laws but found their predictions to be incorrect again.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan, but it was never found.
  The passage concludes by describing how calculations based on Einstein's theory of relativity predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and an increase in confidence in Einstein's theory.
  Therefore, the answer is B: revising a theory.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science, which concerns negative evidence and testing of theories.
  Passage B discusses the case of the discovery of the planet Uranus and later planet Neptune through the revision of the auxiliary assumptions.

Topic: Law
Context: In a recent study, Mario Garcia argues that in the United States between 1930 and I960 the group of political activists he calls the "Mexican American Generation" was more radical and politically diverse than earlier historians have recognized. Through analysis of the work of some of the era's most important scholars, Garcia does provide persuasive evidence that in the 1930s and 1940s these activists anticipated many of the reforms proposed by the more militant Chicanos of the 1960s and 1970s. His study, however, suffers from two flaws.First, Garcia's analysis of the evidence he provides to demonstrate the Mexican American Generation's political diversity is not entirely consistent. Indeed, he undermines his primary thesis by emphasizing an underlying consensus among various groups that tends to conceal the full significance of their differences. Groups such as the League of United Latin American Citizens, an organization that encouraged Mexican Americans to pursue a civil rights strategy of assimilation into the United States political and cultural mainstream, were often diametrically opposed to organizations such as the Congress of Spanish-Speaking People, a coalition group that advocated bilingual education and equal rights for resident aliens in the United States. Garcia acknowledges these differences but dismisses them as insignificant, given that the goals of groups as disparate as these centered on liberal reform, not revolution. But one need only note the fierce controversies that occurred during the period over United States immigration policies and the question of assimilation versus cultural maintenance to recognize that Mexican American political history since 1930 has been characterized not by consensus but by intense and lively debate.Second, Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period. Noting that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased, Garcia argues that between 1930 and 1960 a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor. Influenced by their experience of discrimination and by the inclusive rhetoric of World War II slogans, these leaders, according to Garcia, were determined to achieve full civil rights for all United States residents of Mexican descent. However, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists. Without a better understanding of the political implications of important variables such as patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization, and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create, one cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
Question: The passage supports which one of the following statements about ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans?
Choices:
  A: Ethnic consciousness increases when rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization increase.
  B: Ethnic consciousness increases when the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States increases.
  C: Ethnic consciousness decreases when the number of Mexican Americans assimilating into the culture of the United States increases.
  D: Variations in the influence of Mexican American leaders over the Mexican American population at large account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage focuses on the study by Mario Garcia of the Mexican American Generation between 1930 and 1960. It discusses two flaws in Garcia's arguments but doesn't provide a clear answer to the question. However, the passage indicates that to better understand ethnic consciousness and political activism among the ethnic Mexican population, variables such as rates of immigration and naturalization should be taken into account. Based on this, option E seems to be the most reasonable choice.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage implies that Garcia believes that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans who were born in the United States led to the appearance of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more acculturated and politically active than their predecessors.
  The passage suggests that Garcia's argument concerning the relationship between ethnic Mexican populations and their leaders may be exaggerated.
  Logically, an increase in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization does not necessarily mean a corresponding increase in ethnic consciousness but may affect the variation of ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, the passage supports that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
  The answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage talks about the level of political activity of ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during the period of 1930 to 1960. It also considers the factors that may have influenced this political activity. The passage does not, however, provide any information that supports the specific relationship between ethnic consciousness and immigration or assimilation. Moreover, the passage indicates that the "influence of Mexican American leaders" and the "variation in ethnic consciousness" are related. Thus, we can infer that the ethnic consciousness of Mexican Americans is shaped partly by the influence of their leaders. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the factors that may have influenced the political activism of Mexican Americans.
  The passage mentions that by 1930 the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased and that this may have resulted in a new generation of Mexican American leaders that was more acculturated and politically active.
  The passage also notes that patterns of and rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization and the variations in ethnic consciousness these variables help to create could influence the political activism of Mexican Americans.
  The passage, however, does not clearly state that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases with any of these factors.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States.
  Garcia argues that a new generation of leaders appeared among Mexican Americans between 1930 and 1960, who were more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor.
  Garcia may be exaggerating the degree to which the views of these activists were representative of the ethnic Mexican population residing in the United States during this period.
  One cannot assume that an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.
  Therefore, the passage suggests that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization may account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the increase in the proportion of the Mexican American population that was born in the United States.
  The passage indicates that this increase led to a new generation of Mexican American leaders who were more politically active in the 1930s.
  However, the passage does not make any overt statements about the relationship between this increase and ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, it is not possible to determine which answer choice is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans.
  The passage notes that factors such as rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization affect ethnic consciousness.
  The passage also notes that it is not clear how far the Mexican American leaders' outlook extended beyond these activists.
  However, the passage does not state that ethnic consciousness increases or decreases with rates of naturalization or assimilation.
  Based on the foregoing, the best answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the degree to which Mexican American political activists in the mid-twentieth century represented the ethnic Mexican population at large and whether there was evidence of diversity of opinion within that group.
  The passage suggests that the relationship between increases in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the US and increased political activism is uncertain or ambiguous.
  The passage does not suggest that the degree of ethnic consciousness among Mexican Americans is equal to the degree of ethnic consciousness among Mexican immigrants to the US, so we can eliminate choices A, D, and E.
  The passage does not indicate that ethnic consciousness decreases when Mexican Americans assimilate into the culture of the US. It is not discussing whether assimilation is good or bad, but only acknowledging that it was a point of controversy and that different Mexican American groups had different views on the issue.
  Choice B -  the only option remains unaddressed directly.
  Therefore, B can be the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage discusses the influence of a new generation of Mexican American leaders who wanted to achieve full civil rights for all Mexican Americans. While this may have been a significant political movement of the time, it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond the activists. Thus, the passage neither supports A nor B. The passage does not discuss a decrease in ethnic consciousness either, so C is also incorrect. D could be true, but the passage merely touches on it and does not offer enough evidence to support it. E is directly addressed in the passage, where it is argued that a better understanding of factors such as the rate of immigration and naturalization, as well as variations in ethnic consciousness resulting from these variables, is necessary to fully understand the extent of political activism of Mexican Americans during this period. Therefore, the correct answer is E: Variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage implies that the relationship between ethnic consciousness and the Mexican American population is complex and influenced by many variables. 
  The passage notes that the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased by 1930. 
  Garcia argues that by 1930-1960, a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor.
  It is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists and if an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism. 
  Therefore, the passage does not support choices A, C, or D.
  The passage does note that the rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization can be a variable that accounts in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.
Question: The passage suggests that the author would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements about the colleagues mentioned in line 33?
Choices:
  A: They were partly correct in recommending that Dunham change her methods of data collection, since injury sustained during fieldwork might have compromised her research.
  B: They were partly correct in advising Dunham to exercise initial caution in participating in the Caribbean dances, since her skill in performing them improved with experience.
  C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
  D: They were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  E: They were incorrect in assuming that dance could be studied with the same degree of scientific rigor possible in other areas of ethnology.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the difference in methodology of the approach to research in the field of dance ethnology.
  Dunham's colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The colleagues' advice was not to participate in the dances as it would compromise the research.
  The passage does not suggest any evidence of the colleagues believing that dance should have the same degree of scientific rigor as other areas of ethnology.
  The correct answer is either A or B.
  The colleagues' advice was more about the level of participation in dance observation than the injury Dunham might sustain.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses Dunham's approach to research and how her approach to anthropology and dance allowed her to bring traditional techniques into North American dance.
  Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become involved in the dances, both because of strenuous physical demands and the prevailing view that effective data gathering should be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The author does not appear to agree with the colleagues' advice.
  The passage also mentions that Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham to keep distance from the dances she was observing.
  They advised her to not get involved physically in the dances.
  Dunham believed that the conventional way of observing a culture from detachment was unrealistic and not effective.
  Dunham's approach to research was to involve herself in the dances and observe the technique closely to understand the complex cultural aspect of the traditional dances.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to agree with the statement "They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
They held this position because they subscribed to the view that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
But Dunham's disagreed with their advice and through prolonged immersion in dance practices, she was able to understand dance, comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, and learn techniques to teach them to others.
The passage implies that the author would be most likely to disagree with this view of her colleagues, showing how Dunham's method was more effective than advised.
Action: Answer("C")  They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage provides information about the colleagues' advice to Dunham regarding her fieldwork.
  The colleagues advised her to stay away from the dances she was observing for safety and detach herself from the dances to maintain objectivity during data collection.
  Dunham ignored such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  From this information, one can infer the author's opinion on the validity of such advice.
  The author may also comment on the colleagues' scientific rigor and objectivity towards data gathering.
Action: Answer("C") 
The passage states that Dunham broke from the methodology of detachment that was prevalent in her field at the time by immersing herself in the dances and participating in them. Therefore, the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues who advised Dunham to increase the detachment. The author would disagree with them because extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor. Hence, the correct answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage mentions that the colleagues of Dunham advised her to maintain her objectivity when conducting fieldwork, but they did not fully understand the dance techniques she was studying.
  Dunham was successful because of her own method of immersion, as opposed to detachment.
  The author argues that Dunham's method, although unconventional, provided the most fruitful method of data collection.
  Therefore, the most likely statement the author would agree with is that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage highlights the difference between Katherine Dunham's approach to research and her colleagues' approach to research.
  Dunham's approach was to become involved in the dances she was observing, while her colleagues advised against it because it went against the prevailing methodology of the time.
  The passage does not suggest that Dunham suffered any injuries from her participation.
  The passage does not suggest that Dunham's skill in performing the dances improved with experience.
  The passage does suggest that Dunham's approach to research was successful in comprehending various dances as complex cultural practices.
  The passage does not suggest that Dunham's approach to research was characterized by increasing detachment.
  The passage does not imply that the colleagues were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
  The passage does imply that dance was neglected as an area of social research.
  The author highlights that the recommendation by the colleagues to not become too closely involved with the dances to be 'now fortunately recognized as unrealistic'.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D, which is that the colleagues were incorrect in assuming that researchers in the social sciences are able to gather data in an entirely objective manner.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
The colleagues recommended that Dunham should not become too involved in the dances she was observing.
They believed that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Dunham generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
Dunham was able to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
Therefore, the author would most likely disagree with the colleagues' advice, which suggests that they were incorrect in assuming that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The colleagues mentioned in line 33 advised Dunham to not become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  They gave two reasons for that: the extreme physical demands of the dances and their belief in detached data collection.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from that method and was highly effective.
  It is implied in the passage that Dunham's colleagues were incorrect in their advice to remain detached during data collection.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too deeply involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because of the prevailing view that effective data gathering must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Dunham, despite the advice of her colleagues, participated in the dances herself and immersed herself in them, which allowed her to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices. 
  Therefore, the passage implies that the colleagues were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment. 
  The answer is C: They were incorrect in advising Dunham to increase the degree of her detachment, since extensive personal investment in fieldwork generally enhances scientific rigor.

Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.
Question: The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) primarily to refer to
Choices:
  A: the fees collected by literal agents from their clients
  B: the price paid to have books printed and bound
  C: the royalties paid to authors by their publisbers
  D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books
  E: the total sales ofa book minus the value of those books returned unsold to the bookseller
Response 0:
Thought: 
The author uses the phrase "whole categories of expense" (lines 30-31) in comparison to traditional publishing model and digital publishing. The author talks about the differences between the costs of traditional publishing and digital publishing. According to the passage, traditional publishing incurs costs of printing, selling, and distributing physical books and digital publishing does not. The phrase "whole categories of expense" likely refers to these costs related to traditional publishing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
The author talks about digital publishing being less expensive than traditional publishing because there are no expenses involved in inventory and shipping. This statement is made in the context of explaining the phrase "whole categories of expense"
Option A is incorrect because literal agents' fees are not categorized as a "whole category of expense"
Option B is partially correct, but does not capture the full meaning of the phrase "whole categories of expense".
Option C is incorrect because royalties paid to authors are not a type of expense.
Option E is incorrect because it refers to the net sales value of books, which is not the same as expenses.
Option D is a plausible answer because the author discusses the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books such as the costs of warehousing, shipping, displaying and returning such books, which would be eliminated under the digital publishing model. The elimination of these costs is the main reason why this new model of publishing is expected to be more economical.  Therefore, Option D is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The phrase "whole categories of expense" is mentioned in relation to the digital publishing of a book, which means most expenses that are associated with the traditional book publishing industry will become irrelevant under this new digital model.
  The paragraph mentions warehousing, shipping, displaying physical books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers.
  It says that these costs are irrelevant to digital publication, which suggests that the whole categories of expense are the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: the costs specific to the retail trade in traditional printed books.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
The author discusses the advantages of digital publishing over traditional publishing, including the elimination of specific costs.
The author states that the elimination of these costs means that authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.
Question: The authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether
Choices:
  A: juries should be more forthcoming about the reasoning behind their verdicts
  B: laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people
  C: it is likely that elected officials are more biased in their decision making than jurors are
  D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it
  E: police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue
Response 0:
Thought:
  Passage A argues against jury nullification, indicating that it creates uncertainty about the use of this power for good or evil, that jurors may lack sufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, and that jurors are not representatives of the people like legislators are.
  Passage B views the role of jury nullification as a necessary safety valve to overzealous police and prosecutors and a useful way of indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  Therefore, the authors of the two passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Both passages discuss jury nullification.
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the power to nullify.
  Passage B discusses the usefulness of the power to nullify when the law is unjust or extenuating circumstances exist.
  The passages do not express disagreement regarding the idea that laws are subject to scrutiny and debate by reasonable people.
  Passage A argues that juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision, which suggests the authors would be unlikely to support the idea that juries should have more power to interpret the law.
  Passage B argues that juries can use their power to nullify as a safety valve when prosecutors are overzealous, indicating that the authors do not necessarily disagree on the issue of whether police and prosecutors should have less discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A identifies problems created by the jury's power to nullify. 
  The author of Passage A believes that juries are not accountable for their choices. 
  Passage B argues that in some cases, the discretion of police and prosecutors is flawed.
  Passage B suggests that juries could assist elected officials in particular circumstances.
  It is unclear whether the authors of the passages disagrees about whether juries should be more forthcoming with their reasoning.  
  The authors of the passages do not suggest that elected officials are more biased than jurors. 
  The authors of the passages do not explicitly claim juries are authorized to interpret, rather than apply, the law. 
  The passage briefly mentions the discretion of police and prosecutors but does not indicate whether they should have less or more discretion. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A mentions that juries are not the appropriate forum for disagreements on the reach of criminal laws; and that they are unelected, unaccountable, and lack a long-range view that other governmental institutions possess.
  On the other hand, Passage B argues that, in certain cases, juries can act as a safety valve for executives and legislatures that are overzealous or otherwise making decisions outside of their purview.
  So, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A emphasizes the problems associated with jury nullification and argues that the jury's power to nullify should not be exercised because of the lack of accountability, insufficient evidence, etc. Therefore, the author of passage A is less likely to support the idea that juries should interpret the law.
  Passage B views the jury's power to nullify as a legitimate way of correcting overly broad or unjust laws. The author of passage B is more likely to support the idea that juries should interpret the law.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would be most likely to disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: It is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against the power of jury nullification, due to the fact that it is not a predictable power and is often based on incomplete information. 
  Passage B argues for the power of jury nullification, due to the possibility that law enforcement officials may be overzealous, and because juries can bring to light potential issues with the laws. 
  The two passages differ in their views about the usefulness of jury nullification.
  Therefore, the authors would likely disagree over the role and power of jury nullification.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues against Jury nullification, claiming that it is hard to know how often it is used, that jurors often lack sufficient evidence to make a sound decision, and that the jury is unelected, unaccountable, and has no obligation to the effect that its decisions will have on others. 
  Passage B argues in favor of jury nullification, arguing that when the police and prosecutors are overzealous, the jury can act as a safety valve and also that when a jury nullifies on the grounds that it believes a law is unjust, it is performing a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.
  The question is what the authors of the passages would most like to disagree on.
  Based on the analysis of the passages, it is most likely that the authors disagree about what purview a jury should have in applying and interpreting the law.
  Passage A argues that a jury is only responsible for applying the law and not interpreting it, while Passage B argues that juries play an important role in indicating the potential problems with the law in question.
  The other choices are either too specific or too broad in scope to be the central topic of disagreement between the two passages.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A seems to argue against jury nullification while Passage B argues in favor of it.
  The passages seem to present different views on the role of the jury in interpreting the law.
  Therefore, the authors of the passages would most likely disagree over whether it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
  The answer is D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but to interpret it.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first passage argues against the power of nullification in the jury by outlining the potential problems that can arise such as insufficient evidence, no accountability, and no obligation to consider its impact on others.
  The second passage argues that nullification can be beneficial by acting as a safety valve for overzealous police and prosecutors. It can also indicate to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question, and in uncommon cases of nullification, it is because the jury has compelling reasons to do so.
  The authors seem to disagree on whether nullification can be beneficial or harmful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that jury nullification poses great problems.
  One of the reasons for these problems is that jurors do not explain their verdicts.
  Passage A also argues that jurors are not legislators. They have no proper place interpreting the law.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can assist the legislature.
  Thus, the two passages disagree on D: it is within the purview of juries not only to apply the law but also to interpret it.
  While Passage A argues that jurors are not elected and should not be interpreting law but applying it, Passage B argues that jurors can assist the legislature by indicating when there may be a problem with a law.

Topic: Law
Context: By 1970 it was well established that ultraviolet light from the sun contributes to skin cancer. Fortunately, much of the sun's most damaging ultraviolet radiation is screened out by a thin, diffuse layer of ozone-a toxic form of oxygen-in the stratosphere, 1 0 to 25 miles above the earth's surface. During the 1 970s, however, public policy makers worldwide were alerted to the fragility of the ozone layer through the pioneering research and advocacy of two Nobel Prize-winning scientists, Mario Molina and F. Sherwood Rowland. In the absence of pollutants, stratospheric ozone concentrations should remain stable over time, with natural production and destruction of the gas in rough equilibrium. Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs)-highly volatile chemicals, millions of tons of which had been used each year in products such as aerosol sprays and refrigerants-chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation. Studying two freon gases-types of CFCs-they observed that, when released into the lower atmosphere (troposphere), these gases slowly diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Then??, subjected to massive ultraviolet radiation, they break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine. The resulting increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere is devastating to the ozone layer. Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms. As a result of this chemical reaction, each chlorine atom could destroy as many as 1 00,000 ozone molecules before becoming inactive. In 1 974 the two scientists estimated that the atmosphere contained the accumulation of five years of global CFC production. This meant that, given the rate of diffusion and breakdown of CFCs in the atmosphere, the depletion of the ozone layer would continue for years, if not decades, even if the production and use of CFCs were to cease immediately. Recognizing this as a pressing environmental threat, Molina and Rowland became public advocates for a prompt and proportionate public policy response. As a result, Molina was invited to testify before the U.S. Congress and was later appointed to the U.S. National Science Foundation Committee on Fluorocarbon Technology Assessment. Predictably, the work of Molina and Rowland and their advocacy of dramatic policy changes were subjected to attacks by critics, especially scientists with ties to the CFC industry. However, over time their views were corroborated, especially by the discovery of a hole in the ozone layer over Antarctica, and this led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1 987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases. In North America, CFCs were banned in the late 1 970s, leading to a transformation in packaging for consumer spray products and the development of more environmentally friendly refrigerant chemicals.
Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information in the passage?
Choices:
  A: No refrigerant chemicals other than CFCs had been discovered when Molina and Rowland suggested that CFC production cease.
  B: Refrigerant chemicals developed as substitutes for CFCs after 1987 release fewer chlorine atoms into the stratosphere than CFCs do.
  C: CFCs were originally used in refrigeration components because they provided the most energy-efficient means of refrigeration

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: With which one of the following statements would the author be most likely to agree?
Choices:
  A: In the early days of biotechnology research,scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection for their inventions
  B: Corporate patent holders typically charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
  C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  D: Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
  E: Scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Response 0:
Thought: 
The passage discusses the benefits and concerns related to patenting in the biotechnology industry and its impact on basic research. 
The author provides evidence to support the argument that patents can spur rather than hinder basic research, as they provide scientists with incentives to innovate. 
The author also highlights that patents may not be enforced against researchers engaging in basic and noncommercial research.
Option A is incorrect because the passage does not provide evidence to support the claim that scientists freely shared research materials because they were not entitled to intellectual property protection. 
Option B is incorrect because the passage does not suggest that all corporate patent holders charge excessive fees for the right to conduct research involving their patented materials.
Option D is incorrect because the passage does not explicitly state that biotechnology researchers in academic institutions rely too heavily on funding that is partially contingent on the patentability of their results.
Option E is incorrect because the author does not suggest that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author argues against the claim that patenting of biotechnology inventions will hinder basic research.
  The author's main argument is that patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
  The author also argues that patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee.
  Moreover, the author points out that judges have respected a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement in choice C, that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
The author seems to support the idea of patenting biotechnology, but also acknowledges concerns about the restrictions on access to research materials such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals.
The author emphasizes that granting a patent does not imply the right to deny access, and that judges usually respect completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
The author argues that patenting biotechnology could incentivize scientists to innovate and conduct more research.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The author argues against the idea of biotechnology patents hindering basic research and that patents actually spur rather than hinder basic research.  
The author suggests that whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable.  
The author also mentions the tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.  
Therefore, the author would most likely agree with choice C: The cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage suggests that patents provide scientists with an incentive to innovate and that there is a non-commercial research exception to patent infringement. It also notes that concerns about patent holders hindering basic research through legal action may be unfounded because patent litigation is expensive and judges are likely to respect the non-commercial research exception.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author mainly discusses the advantages and disadvantages of patenting biotechnology inventions.
  The author argues against the perceived threat to basic research-relating to restrictions on access to research materials and denying access to biological materials.
  The author believes that there is a noncommercial research exception to patent infringement.
  The author argues that patents are likely to spur rather than hinder basic research.
  Option A is incorrect as the passage does not mention intellectual property protection during the early days of biotechnology research.
  Option B contradicts with the author's claim that attempting to charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials is not common.
  Option C is consistent with the author's argument that patent litigation is expensive and also an effective check on patent holders' attempts or threats to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
  Option D is partially correct as biotechnology researchers in academic institutions do rely on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results but the author does not suggest they rely too heavily on it.
  Option E is unsupported. The author does not claim that scientists who oppose the idea of patenting biotechnology do so because their work is not sufficiently innovative to qualify for patent protection.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
The author argues that patents are beneficial for basic research in biotechnology.
The author argues that the fear of patent infringement lawsuits is overblown, and researchers can still access necessary biotechnology materials for basic research.
Therefore, the statement that the author would most likely agree with is that:
Patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate.
The answer is option E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author argues that patenting is necessary for biotechnology research and innovation.
  The article explains that researchers who fear patenting believe it limits access to biological materials. However, the author disagrees, explaining that patent litigation is expensive and suggesting that a non-commercial research exception exists. 
  The author therefore would most likely agree with choice C, that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials, since this aligns with their argument that patent litigation is expensive and would likely not be pursued in order to prevent basic research.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The author argues that the perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials for research unless a costly materials-transfer or license agreement is undertaken. Therefore, the author is likely to agree that patent litigation cost is an effective check on patent holders who might otherwise try to prevent researchers engaged in basic research from using patented materials.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The author argues that the concerns about restricting basic research focus on restrictions on access to research materials rather than the patent rights themselves.
  The author explains that patent rights don't necessarily grant the right to deny access to biological materials.
  The author argues that patents spur rather than hinder basic research because they provide scientists an incentive to innovate.
  The cost of patent litigation is presented as one of the reasons why denying access to biological materials is unlikely to be enforced against researchers conducting basic and noncommercial research.
  Therefore, the author would agree with statement C that the cost of patent litigation is an effective check on patent holders who might try to prevent basic research.

  The question asks about an experiment that would be useful in determining whether a chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs deplete the ozone layer, so any chemical that is a possible replacement cannot deplete ozone.
  It further explains that CFCs eventually diffuse upward into the stratosphere and break down into their constituent elements, which include chlorine.
  These chlorine atoms are harmful to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, any prospective replacement for CFCs should not chemically react with chlorine.
  If a chemical is capable of reacting with chlorine, then it is not a suitable replacement for CFCs.
  The best answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks about experiments that could be useful in determining a replacement for CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes how Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which then destroys the ozone layer.
  Therefore, we need to find an experiment that tests if a chemical can replace CFCs without breaking down into chlorine or any other harmful elements that may damage the ozone layer.
  Choice C proposes testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  If the chemical reacts with chlorine, then it might not be a suitable alternative since it can damage the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question is asking what information would be most useful in determining if a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains that CFCs tend to break down into their constituent elements when subjected to ultraviolet radiation and that one of those elements is chlorine.
  Since the biggest risk CFCs pose to the ozone layer is the release of chlorine, then it's reasonable to assume that any chemical that can replace CFCs without causing damage to the ozone should be tested to determine if it would chemically react with chlorine.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The question is asking about a chemical that could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage mentions that CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  Molina and Rowland showed how manufactured CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, which is devastating to the ozone layer.
  The testing that would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer is testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
  Therefore, the answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are responsible for causing damage to the ozone layer by releasing chlorine.
  Molina and Rowland's discussion focuses on the environmental effects of CFCs.
  The question asks about determining whether the chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  So, the property of the new chemical is of concern in the question.
  Knowing if the chemical has similar properties to chlorine can help determine if it would also cause ozone layer depletion.
  Therefore, the answer is D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question is asking about which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage explains how CFCs cause depletion of the ozone layer.
  Thus, it would be useful to test the chemical to see if it shares any properties with CFCs that cause the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Choice (D) suggests testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine which is one of the components of CFCs that cause the depletion of the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is D: testing to see what chemical properties the chemical or its constituent elements share with chlorine. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The question asks which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  According to the passage, CFCs damage the ozone layer by chemically reacting with the ozone and depleting it.
  Therefore, it is important to test whether the replacement chemical would have a similar effect to CFCs, such as reacting with ozone or releasing harmful chemicals.
  Options A, C, D, and E do not directly address whether the chemical will damage the ozone layer.
  Option B is potentially useful because it would determine whether the new chemical would react with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere. If the chemical reacts with other chemicals in the lower atmosphere it could then pose a danger to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, the answer is B: testing to see whether the chemical, when released into the lower atmosphere, would react with other chemicals commonly found there. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question is asking which experiment would be most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage discusses how the depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs occurs, by breaking down into its constituent elements including chlorine which then attacks and depletes the ozone layer.
  In order to be able to determine whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer, an experiment must test whether the chemical would cause ozone depletion by reacting to its constituent elements, including chlorine.
  Therefore, the most useful experiment would be C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks about finding a chemical that could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The passage describes how CFCs damage the ozone layer.
  Testing the chemical with other chemicals or forms of oxygen would not yield useful information.
  If the new chemical also reacts with chlorine, it could damage the ozone layer.
  Testing for chemical properties shared with chlorine is not specified in the text as useful for determining whether a new chemical could replace CFCs.
  The passage says that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, so it is important to test whether a new chemical would break down into its components.
  Therefore, testing the chemical to see whether it would break down into its components when subjected to ultraviolet radiation is the most useful information for determining a new chemical to replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question is about determining whether a particular chemical can replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland discovered that CFCs damage the ozone layer by chemically attacking and depleting the ozone layer.
  Molina and Rowland observed that CFCs break down into their constituent elements, including chlorine, at high altitude in the stratosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone in the stratosphere react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  A chemical that would replace CFCs must not react chemically with chlorine, which is damaging to the ozone layer.
  Therefore, among the choices given, testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine in the stratosphere is the most useful in determining whether a particular chemical could replace CFCs without damaging the ozone layer.
  The answer is C: testing the chemical to determine whether it would chemically react with chlorine.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Karl Popper's main contribution to the philosophy of science science concerns the power of negative evidence. The fundamental point is simple: No number of white swans, for example, can ever prove that all swans are white, but a single black swan disproves the hypothesis. Popper gives this logical asymmetry between positive and negative evidence hyperbolic application, maintaining that positive evidence has no value as evidence and that negative evidence is tantamount to disproof. Moreover, Popper takes the search for negative evidence to be at the heart of scientific research; that is, for Popper, scientific research involves not only generating bold theories, but also searching for evidence that would disprove them. Indeed, for him, a theory counts as scientific only if it makes predictions that are testable in this way. However, Popper's use of the logical asymmetry does not adequately capture the actual situation scientists face. If a theory deductively entails a false prediction, then the theory must be false as well. But a scientific theory rarely entails predictions on its own. When scientists actually derive a theory's predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. When a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one. When an experiment does not work out as predicted, there is usually more than one possible explanation. Positive evidence is never conclusive. But negative evidence rarely is either. Passage B When the planet Uranus was discovered, astronomers attempted to predict its orbit. They based their predictions on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets. One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus. When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect. One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that Newton's laws were incorrect. Another was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions. The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit. Not long afterward, scientists discovered the planet Neptune in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations Later astronomers, again using Newton's laws, predicted the orbit of Mercury. Once again, the predictions were not borne out. They hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Vulcan. However, Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error. Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, astronomers discovered that calculations based on that theory and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
Question: In passage B, which one of the following most clearly illustrates a disturbing force, as described in passage A (line 26)?
Choices:
  A: Uranus
  B: the sun
  C: Neptune
  D: Mercury
  E: the moon
Response 0:
Thought:
  In Passage A (line 26), "auxiliary" premises referred to additional premises needed to make predictions, which could include the assumption of the correct functioning of instrumentation or the absence of disturbing forces.
  In Passage B, Uranus's orbit was calculated based on "auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets" (lines 29-31).
  It follows that the correct answer should be a factor that could affect the observed orbit of Uranus, that is, a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("B")  
The best answer is B: the sun.
Response 1:
Thought:
  In passage A, the author describes that scientists usually need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises, which appeal to other theories, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc. 
  In passage B, there is a discussion about the orbit of Mercury, which was not as was predicted, leading to the hypothesis of the existence of another planet in the vicinity.
  None of the given choices explains the disturbing force in the context of Passage A.
    A, B, C, and E are not related to the disturbing force.
  The only choice left is D.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mercury.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  In Passage A, the author describes auxiliary premises and one of the considerations was the disturbing force when measuring orbits of planets.
  In Passage B, the discovery of Uranus' orbit was based on auxiliary assumptions, and one of those assumptions turned out to be false.
  Based on this, the answer might be a celestial object that might cause a disturbing force and cause an error in the prediction made by the astronomers.
  The sun is too far to disturb the motion of Uranus, and the moon is too small to affect the orbit sufficiently. 
  On the other hand, Neptune could be the answer since it was an object close enough to Uranus that could have produced the observed orbit, leading to the reconsideration of the pre-existing auxiliary assumptions.
  Action: Answer("C") - Neptune
Response 3:
Thought: 
  In passage B, the astronomers predicted the orbit of Uranus, but the predictions were incorrect.
  They hypothesized the existence of another planet, Neptune.
  Later, they predicted the orbit of Mercury using Newton's laws, but the predictions were not borne out.
  To reconcile this, they hypothesized the existence of another planet, Vulcan.
  Vulcan was never found, and some scientists began to think that perhaps Newton's laws were in error.
  They later discovered that calculations based on Einstein's general theory of relativity and the old auxiliary assumptions predicted the observed orbit of Mercury, leading to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity and to increased confidence in Einstein's theory.
  Therefore, the answer is an object that influenced the motion of Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury.
  The choices are Uranus, the sun, Neptune, Mercury, and the moon.
  The sun is not a disturbing force as it is the center of the solar system and other celestial bodies orbit around it. Uranus, Neptune, and Mercury had their orbits affected, but only by forces other than the moon. 
  Therefore, the answer is either Uranus, Neptune, or Mercury.
  However, passage B does not give any indication that any of the planets were affected by a disturbing force.
  None of the choices is appropriate; hence, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage B described astronomers trying to predict the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions related to the mass of the sun and other planets. 
  The astronomers made their observation based on the predicted orbit of Uranus, but found that the orbit was incorrect and there could be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  At the end, Einstein's general theory of relativity was discovered which explained the calculations of the observed orbit of Mercury.
  So, none of the Uranus, the sun, Neptune, Mercury, or the moon is an example of the disturbing force.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We are looking for an object that illustrates a disturbing force.
  According to Passage A, disturbing forces can be auxiliary premises.
  In Passage B, auxiliary assumptions were made while calculating the orbit of Uranus.
  Assumptions about the existence of other planets were made to predict the orbit of Uranus.
  These assumptions led the astronomers to the discovery of Neptune.
  There were also assumptions made to predict the orbit of Mercury.
  Einstein's general theory of relativity proved to be the correct theory to predict the orbit of Mercury.
  This means that something was disturbing the orbit of Mercury.
  The most likely answer is that the disturbing force is another planetary body near the orbit of Mercury.
  So, the answer is D: Mercury. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The correct answer must be something which is acting as a disturbing force.
  In the context of passage A, disturbing force refers to any external force that may cause anomalies in the results of experiments.
  In Passage B, the astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  One of these auxiliary assumptions was that there were no planets in the vicinity of Uranus.
  However, when the actual orbit was calculated, it was discovered to be incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the discrepancy was the existence of another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, in Passage B, the force that could have caused the disturbance is the planet Neptune, which caused Uranus's orbit to be different than what was predicted.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A explains that when a prediction fails, logic indicates that at least one of the premises must be false, but it does not indicate which one.
  Passage B shows that when the predictions based on Newton's laws are not borne out, astronomers hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity.
  This new planet could be considered a disturbing force because its existence was an auxiliary assumption which was used to explain why the predictions based on Newton's laws did not match the observations.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions "disturbing forces" but not clearly states what they are.
  However, it explains that auxiliary premises are usually needed to derive a theory's prediction, which could involve not only other theories but also other factors such as instrumentation and disturbing forces.
  Passage B describes an example where the failure of an orbit prediction was due to an erroneous auxiliary assumption that no other planet existed in the vicinity of Uranus. If these astronomers had considered the existence of other planets that could produce a gravitational force on Uranus, their prediction could have been more accurate.
  Answer: Since none of the answer choices is a "disturbing force", and "Uranus" and "Neptune" are involved in the story of the prediction, it is not clear which one of them could be related to a disturbing force. Therefore, none of the given answer choices most clearly illustrates a disturbing force.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Disturbing forces are mentioned in passage A.
  The passage A says that theories rarely entail predictions on their own and that when scientists derive theories' predictions, they almost always need diverse additional "auxiliary" premises that appeal to other theories, to the correct functioning of instrumentation, to the absence of disturbing forces, etc.
  Passage B discusses what happened when astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus and later the orbit of Mercury, based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  It is mentioned that one of the auxiliary assumptions about Uranus was that no planets existed in its vicinity, but later that assumption turned out to be false which lead them to hypothesize the existence of another planet (later named Neptune), whereas, some scientists thought Newton's laws were in error.
  For Mercury, also using Newton's laws as an auxiliary assumption, they hypothesized the existence of another planet which they named 'Vulcan', which was never found.
  Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, it explained the observed orbit of Mercury and led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
  Based on the above understanding, the answer should be the option that mentions a force that can cause disturbance in an orbit.
  The option E which mentions the moon is irrelevant and can be ruled out.
  Option A Uranus is the planet whose orbit was predicted, and auxiliary assumptions were made that turned out to be false, but there is no mention of any disturbing force.
  Option B, the sun, is not mentioned in the context of being a disturbing force.
  Option C Neptune is the planet that they later discovered which explained the orbit of Uranus thus not a disturbing force.
  Option D, Mercury, was the planet whose orbit was predicted using the auxiliary assumptions of Newton's laws and other theories. They later hypothesized that there might be another planet close enough to cause disturbance but later rejected that idea.
  Based on the above analysis, none of the options mention anything to illustrate a disturbing force. Hence, the answer is 'None of the Above' (Most Likely Answer). Therefore the Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Topic: Law
Context: The Internet makes possible the instaotaoeous transmission and retrieval of digital text. It is widely assumed that this capacity will lead to the displacement of printed books by digitized books that are read mainly on computer screens or handheld electronic devices. But it is more likely, I believe, that most digital files of books will be prioted and bound on demand at point of sale by machines that can quickly and inexpensively make single copies that are indistinguishable from books made in fiIctories. Once most books have been digitized, aoyone with access to the Internet will be able to purchase printed books from a practieally limitless digital catalog that includes even those books that, under traditional publishing assumptions, would have been desigoated "out of print." Also, the digital publication of a book online involves no pbysical inventory', thereby eliminating the costs of warehousing, shipping books to wholesalers and to retail stores, displaying pbysieal books in retail stores, and returning unsold books to publishers. This would make digital publishing much less expensive than traditional publishing. Given the economic efficiency and convenience for customers of this new digital model of publishing, it is likely to eventually supplant or at least rival traditional publishingalthough it will be some time before a catalog of printable digitized books becomes large enough to jusillY investment in book prioting machines at numerous regional sites. Moreover, the elimination of whole categories of expensemeans that under the digital publishing model,authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore, according to literal)' agents, be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds. Currently a large percentage of publishers' revenue is absorbed by the costs of printing, selling, and distributing pbysical books, costs that are irrelevant to digital publication. LiteraI)' agents marketing new manuscripts could thus be expected to demand a significantly bigger slice of revenue for their authors than has been traditional. But large, established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede. So the opportunity to bid for new manuscripts will go first to upstart digital-publishing firms unfettered by traditional practices or infrastructure. Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduee their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors. Such adjustments are typical of the interval between a departing economic model and its successor and may help explain the caution with which today's publishing conglomerates are approaching the digital future.

Topic: Law
Context: Mexican Americans share with speakers of Spanish throughout the world a rich and varied repertoire of proverbs as well as a vital tradition of proverb use. The term "proverb" refers to a self-contained saying that can be understood independent of a specific verbal context and that has as its main purpose the carrying of a message or piece of wisdom. The great majority of Spanish-language proverbs reached Mexico from peninsular Spain, though they did not all originate there. Many belong, in fact, to the common proverb tradition of Europe and have exact equivalents in English-language proverbial speech. Each use of a proverb is an individual act whose meaning varies depending on the individual speaker and the particular social context in which the use occurs. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that proverb use is also shaped by the larger community with which the individual interacts. The fact that proverbs often serve a didactic purpose points us to one important function that proverbs serve in Mexican American communities: the instruction of the young. In fact, this function seems to be much more prominent in Mexican tradition in general than in English-speaking traditions. Adolescents of Mexican descent in the United States consistently report the frequent use of proverbs by their parents as a teaching tool, in areas ranging from the inculcation of table manners to the regulation of peer-group relationships. The latter area is a particularly frequent focus of proverb use within Mexican American communities: one of the most frequently used proverbs, for example, translates roughly as, "Tell me who you run with and I'll tell you who you are." Perhaps this emphasis on peer-group relations derives from a sense that traditional, community-approved norms are threatened by those prevalent in the surrounding society, or from a sense that, in dealing with older children especially, parents need to appeal to traditional wisdom to bolster their authority. Another dimension of proverb use within Mexican American communities is that proverbs often serve to foster a consciousness of ethnicity, that is, of membership in a particular ethnic group possessing features that distinguish it from other groups within a multiethnic environment. Even those Mexican American proverbs that do not have an explicitly didactic purpose nevertheless serve as a vehicle for the transmission of both the Spanish language and Mexican culture. It is in these sayings that links to folklore and other aspects of Mexican culture are established and maintained. Proverbs thus provide a means of enhancing Mexican American young people's familiarity with their heritage, thereby strengthening their ties to Mexican tradition.
Question: The author provides a translation of a proverb in lines 32–33 primarily in order to
Choices:
  A: illustrate the relation between proverb use and education about peer-group relationships in Mexican American communities
  B: provide an example of the tone of a proverb that is frequently used in Mexican American communities
  C: illustrate how a proverb can function as an appeal to traditional wisdom
  D: provide an example of how some Spanish-language proverbs can be clearly translated into English
  E: illustrate the effectiveness of proverbs as educational tools in Mexican American communities
Response 0:

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: It can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely have agreed with which one of the following statements about the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday?
Choices:
  A: It is correct because of its requirement that art have a strong element of the fantastic.
  B: It is correct because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
  C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
  D: It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
  E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The topic talks about the different positions taken by the Russian literary critics during Dostoyevsky's time.
  One group of critics believed that art should be above the present and the everyday.
  This view is not the same as Dostoyevsky's view, but it is not clear from the passage whether Dostoyevsky agrees or disagrees with this view.
  There is no evidence in the passage to support options A, B, C, or D.
  Dostoyevsky believes that the artistic merit should be the only criteria to evaluate a literary work, rather than its societal usefulness.
  Therefore, he is likely to disagree with the view that art should further some societal end.
  The answer is E: It is incorrect because of its insistence that art further some societal end.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the two significant and opposing views held by the Russian literary critics of Dostoyevsky's time.
  According to the passage, Dostoyevsky took a third position as a realist which is different from the two opposing views.
  The passage states that for Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, but reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the idea that art should stand high above the present and the everyday since he believes that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, so art should incorporate the perception of reality by an individual.
  Option A and B are neither correct nor incorrect, they do not precisely explain Dostoyevsky's opinion and cannot be inferred from the passage. 
Action: Answer("D") It is incorrect because it makes no distinction between reality and fantasy.
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks us to infer Dostoevsky's view on the statement that "art should stand high above the present and everyday".
  The passage mentions that Dostoevsky believed reality was literature's crucial source but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  In contrast to radical critics, the statement implies that art should not be grounded in concrete reality.
  Therefore, Dostoevsky would not agree with this statement.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky took the position that reality was crucial to literature, but that reality was more than just the tangible.
  Dostoyevsky believed that there was another sphere called "the fantastic", which was not superfluous to a writer's concern.
  He also believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit and that the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear was a contradiction in terms.
  Thus, it can be inferred that he would disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday life; he believed that literature's crucial source was reality, including the fantastic.
  The answer is B: It is incorrect because it recognizes that reality is more than just an enumeration of the mundane details of life.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that realism was crucial for literature.
  Dostoyevsky understood that there's no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  For Dostoyevsky, the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the idea that literature must serve a particular political view.
  Literature must be useful, but the radical critics' insistence that it must serve a particular vision was a shameless destiny.
  Dostoyevsky believed that artistry is the ability to write well, that a literary work must have artistic merit.
  Dostoyevsky rejected the idea that literature must be useful to society.
  
  From the passage, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would mostly like to disagree with the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and the everyday. Dostoyevsky was a realist and he believed that reality was the crucial source of literature. Dostoyevsky also believed that the fantastic must be intimate with the real, and that literature must have artistic merit. He also rejected the idea that literature must serve a particular political view.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question is asking what Dostoyevsky would agree with regarding the view held by some Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and everyday.
  The passage states that Dostoyevsky's position was different than either the position that art should be useful or the position that it should be high above the present and everyday.
  Dostoyevsky was a realist, and believed that reality was crucial to literature.
  However, he also believed that reality was not limited to the tangible and that there was a fantastic component to reality.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Dostoyevsky would not agree with the statement that art should stand high above the present and everyday as he believed that reality was the foundation of all literature.
  The answer is C: It is incorrect because reality must be the foundation of all literature.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky took a third position, which differed from the other two positions.
  The first position maintained that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.
  Dostoevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, and for him, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality.
  Also, the radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning art "a shameful destiny."
  Therefore, he is not likely to agree with the Russian critics that art should stand high above the present and the everyday.

Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: The author most likely lists some of the themes and objects influencing and appearing in Lichtenstein's paintings (lines 38–43) primarily to
Choices:
  A: show that the paintings depict aspects of contemporary life
  B: support the claim that Lichtenstein's work was parodic in intent

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are limits to the usefulness of stealing thunder, its effectiveness in actual trials has been demonstrated through research conducted by psychologists and legal scholars.
  B: The commonly practiced courtroom strategy of stealing thunder can have unintended consequences if the lawyers using it do not accurately predict jurors' attitudes.
  C: Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.
  D: The risks involved in stealing thunder can outweigh the probable benefits when the information to be revealed is too readily available or too negative in its impact.
  E: Research designed to confirm the usefulness of stealing thunder has vindicated lawyers' belief in the value of the technique and has identified the general limitations of the strategy's effectiveness.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws, or particular applications of law, simply by declining to prosecute violators. This power appears to be exercised frequently and I attempt here to explain why. Rules of law are almost always overinclusive: read literally, they forbid some conduct that the legislature that formulated the rule did not want to forbid. The costs of precisely tailoring a rule to the conduct intended to be forbidden would be prohibitive given the limitations of human foresight and the inherent ambiguities of language. The more particularly the legislature tries to describe the forbidden conduct, the more loopholes it will create. Enforcing an overinclusive rule to the letter could impose very heavy social costs. The effect would be like punishing an innocent person in order to reduce the probability of acquitting a guilty one. Of course, the danger of punishing the innocent is not a decisive blow against the use of a particular method of law enforcement; the danger must be traded off against the costs of alternative methods that would reduce it. But there is a technique-discretionary nonenforcement-by which the costs of overinclusion can be reduced without a corresponding increase in underinclusion (loopholes). Of course, allowing discretionary nonenforcement does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases. Conceivably the agency could concentrate its resources on those areas of conduct that had been brought inadvertently within the scope of the rule. But this seems unlikely. Capricious enforcement is not unknown (or even rare) but it does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced. Passage B The newspaper reported that 231,000 water customers in the city are late paying their bills-some by months, others by decades. In all, these water delinquents owe the city more than $625 million in overdue bills and penalties. So officials are planning to selectively cut the water to a few residences with outstanding bills to show that they are serious about collecting those debts. Officials plan to target only high-income neighborhoods, to make examples of a few privileged residents who will be in no position to complain since they were caught stiffing the system. But property owners are responsible for water bills. So why not just do what every other property-related creditor or tax authority does-attach a lien to the property? The money owed would automatically be available whenever a property was sold, and the threat of negative credit implications would be a powerful incentive to keep current with one's water obligations. Well, here's an answer: a loophole prohibits debts other than taxes from being subject to liens by the city, and, technically, water charges are not taxes. But if the problem is with the law, then why not change the law? Wouldn't that be easier, and politically smarter, than shutting off people's water?
Question: Passage A suggests that an instance of "capricious enforcement" (line 32) most likely involves
Choices:
  A: enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible
  B: enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws
  C: prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes
  D: not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law
  E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law
Response 0:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement means an unpredictable and arbitrary way of enforcing the law.
  The passage argues that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the social cost of overinclusion without a corresponding increase in underinclusion.
  The agency selecting cases based on random criteria seems uncharacteristic of municipal agencies and their oversight by the legislature.
  Thus, "capricious enforcement" seems unlikely to be involved in cases prioritizing which laws to enforce or those who breach the laws.
  Answer choice E seems the more likely of the last two answers presented. It is challenging to ensure that agencies follow what the legislature intended when creating a law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage A defines the technique by which law enforcement agencies can effectively nullify particular laws or particular applications of laws, which is discretionary nonenforcement.
  Passage A also states that capricious enforcement is not a central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  The passage does not suggest that capricious enforcement occurs when enforcing the law only to the degree that municipal resources make possible or when prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes or not understanding the difference between the letter of the law and the intent of the law.
  Instead, capricious enforcement entails not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  Therefore, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains the technique of discretionary nonenforcement and its importance.
  The technique helps in reducing the cost of overinclusion without increasing the loopholes of underinclusion.
  Capricious enforcement means unpredictable enforcement, which is not the central tendency of law enforcement.
  From the passage, it is evident that the enforcement agency will select its cases based on legislative oversight. 
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is an exception, not the rule.
  So, the answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A defines "capricious enforcement" as the outcome without a principle for selecting its cases.
  The passage suggests that legislative oversight restrains law enforcement agencies from deviating too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, "capricious enforcement" most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  In Passage A, discretionary nonenforcement helps to reduce the costs of overinclusion in the law.
  Capricious enforcement, which is rare, is not the central tendency as the legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Capricious enforcement involves selecting cases based on random choice or personal whim.
  The passage argues that discretionary nonenforcement is unlikely to be capricious and oversight ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement deviates from legislative intent.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains how discretionary non-enforcement is exercised by law enforcement agencies.
  Capricious enforcement refers to law enforcement that is arbitrary and inconsistent.
  The passage does not state a direct definition for capricious enforcement.
  However, it suggests that capricious enforcement is not the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement most likely involves not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Capricious enforcement means enforcement without any clear principle.
  Passage A suggests that this is not the central tendency of law enforcement agencies.
  The agency is also guided by legislative oversight, which ensures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is most likely enforcement without following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that discretionary nonenforcement can reduce the costs of overinclusion without increasing underinclusion.
  Discretionary nonenforcement as a technique to reduce costs does not determine the principle by which the law enforcement agency will select its cases.
  Capricious enforcement (line 32) does not appear to be the central tendency since legislative oversight assures that the agency does not stray too far from the intended, as distinct from the enacted, regulation being enforced.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement is not about enforcing the law according to the legislature's intent in passing the laws.
  It is also not about prioritizing enforcement of the law according to the amount of damage caused by the crimes.
Action: Answer("E") 
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A defines discretionary nonenforcement as a potential solution to overinclusive laws.
  Law enforcement agencies must select which cases to investigate.
  Passage A suggests that capricious enforcement is a possibility.
  Capricious enforcement would mean that the principle for selecting cases is arbitrary or random.
  Therefore, capricious enforcement would not align with the intent of the legislature.
  The answer is E: not following the intent of the legislature in enforcing the law.

Topic: Law
Context: Determining the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes, such as fraud, as opposed to impulsive crimes, such as crimes of passion, is a problem currently being debated in the legal community. On one side of the debate are those scholars who believe that deliberate crimes are a product of the influence of societal norms and institutions on individuals. These scholars suggest that changing people's beliefs about crime, increasing the access of the most economically alienated individuals to economic institutions, and rehabilitating those convicted of this type of crime will reduce the crime rate. On the other side are those legal scholars who believe that the decision to commit a deliberate crime is primarily the result of individual choice. They suggest that increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement, is the best deterrence method. However, some recent legal scholarship has changed the nature of this debate by introducing an economic principle that shows that these two positions, far from being antithetical, are surprisingly complementary. The economic principle that reconciles the two positions is that of utility maximization, which holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility. The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities. Using this economic framework, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice. According to the utility maximization principle a person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful. Within this framework the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect. For instance, the recommendations on one side of the crime deterrence debate to increase penalties for crimes and strengthen law enforcement result in an increased likelihood of detection and punishment and impose an increased cost to the individual if detected and punished. This lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime. The recommendations on the other side of the debate, such as increasing the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions, also affect the utility equation. All else being equal, enacting these types of policies will effectively increase the expected utility from lawful activity. This economic analysis demonstrates that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
Question: Based on the passage, which one of the following scenarios is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate?
Choices:
  A: an astronomer's use of a paradox employed by certain ancient cosmologists as a metaphor to help describe a phenomenon recently observed with the aid of new technologies
  B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other
  C: a botanist's use of a quotation from a legendary Olympic athlete to make a point about the competitive nature of plants in a forest
  D: a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case
  E: a mediator's use of a short quotation from a well-known novel in an attempt to set a tone of collegiality and good conduct at the start of a bargaining session
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about how using the utility maximization principle makes the debate about deterrence methods complementary rather than antithetical.
  The utility maximization principle is an economic principle that analyzes an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The realistic application of an economic principle in the legal discussion is similar to what is done by some legal scholars using the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle.
  It explains how the principle applies to the deterrence of deliberate crimes.
  The principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The passage argues that legal scholars who suggest harsher fines and penalties as a deterrence method are using the principle.
  The principle explains that increasing the cost and risk of punishment for a crime lowers the expected utility of criminal acts, thereby deterring commission of the crime.
  Therefore, some legal scholars are using the utility maximization principle to demonstrate that, given economic disincentives or deterrents, individuals would rationally choose lawful activity over criminal activity.
  The answer is B: a drawing instructor's use of a law of optics from physics to demonstrate that two lines that appear to diverge actually run parallel to each other, because the use of the utility maximization principle to explain a phenomenon (i.e., crime deterrence) is similar to using a law (i.e., the law of optics) to explain a phenomenon (i.e., the apparent divergence of two lines).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the utility maximization principle and how it reconciles the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  An individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed within this framework as a rational economic choice.
  Both the recommendations to increase the penalties for crimes and to increase the economic opportunities of individuals most alienated from economic institutions can affect the utility equation.
  Therefore, legal scholars would use the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage is about how the utility maximization principle can be used to analyze a person's decision to commit a crime.
  Some legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to analyze this type of economic choice.
  The utility maximization principle is a principle in economics that states that people choose the action that maximizes their satisfaction.
  A scenario that is similar to this would be one where a principle or method from one field is applied to another field in order to gain a better understanding.
  There is no mention of any such scenario in the passage other than the one involving the utility maximization principle.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Legal scholars use economic principle of utility maximization to interpret criminal decision-making as a rational economic choice.
  Within this analysis, increased penalties for crimes, and law enforcement, lead to lower expected utility from criminal activity.
  On the other side of the debate, having increased economic opportunities affects the utility equation to increase expected utility from lawful activity.
  The utility maximization principle is employed by legal scholars to support both sides of the debate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how legal scholars use the utility maximization principle regarding the crime deterrence debate.
  Legal scholars use the principle to show that the two sides of the debate are not in conflict and that both deterrence strategies are complementary.
  Therefore, we need to find an option where a principle, similar to the utility maximization principle, reconciles two ideas that seem antithetical.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage explains the use of utility maximization principle to analyze the decision of deliberate crime.
  Using this principle, an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Both deterrence methods - changing societal norms, institutions, etc. and increasing fines and penalties of the criminal activity - have the same overall effect in lowering the expected utility of the criminal activity.
  Based on this analysis, legal scholars can reconcile their debate over how to deter deliberate crimes.
  Therefore, the scenario that is most similar to some legal scholars' use of the utility maximization principle in the crime deterrence debate, is: 
Action: Answer("D") a judge's use of evidence from anthropology to support a decision in a controversial legal case.
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the utility maximization principle is used to demonstrate that rational individuals commit crimes if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Legal scholars use the utility maximization principle to explain the rational decision making of an individual in committing crimes.
  Therefore, the most similar scenario would be where an expert uses a principle from a field that is not their own to explain a phenomenon in their own field.
  Option A is not related to the crime deterrence debate.
  Option B is not related to the crime deterrence debate.
  Option C is not related to the crime deterrence debate.
  Option D is not the most similar scenario as legal scholars are using another field's principle to explain a concept within their own field and there is no mention of supporting a legal decision.
  Option E is not related to the crime deterrence debate.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle to reconcile two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  According to the utility maximization principle, individuals will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  Legal scholars support deterrence through "increasing the fines and penalties associated with criminal activity, along with efficacious law enforcement."
  This increase imposes an increased cost to the criminal and lowers the expected utility from criminal activity, thereby making a person less likely to choose to commit a deliberate crime.
  This scenario is most similar to choice B, where a drawing instructor uses a law of optics from physics to explain a drawing concept.
  The legal scholars used an economic principle to explain why increased penalties and law enforcement would reduce crime.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the economic principle of utility maximization as the rational choice for committing a crime.
  The economic principle of utility maximization is used by some legal scholars to reconcile the two positions in the debate on crime deterrence.
  Therefore, the answer would be the option that shows how some legal scholars use the principle of utility maximization principle in the debate on crime deterrence.
  The only option that discusses the use of one field's concept in another field is B.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
Question: Given the information in the passage, which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount oftime it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split?
Choices:
  A: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium were all using the same research techniques.
  B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn did not have partieular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
  C: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment ofuraniwn had not been aware of the calculations indicating that in principle it was possible to split atoms.
  D: More physicists concentrated on oblBining experimental results from the neutron bombardment ofuraniwn.
  E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that earlier theoretical physicists had produced calculations showing that it was possible to split atoms.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission.
  The physicists compiling evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved did not recognize what they were witnessing. 
  The products of the neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified partly because they were expected to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  The minute quantities of substances produced made precise chemical analyses difficult.
  Physicists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings of nuclear fission when they were published.
  Therefore, if the physicists did not have preconceived expectations about the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to recognize the significance of the data relating to underlying theoretical considerations and quicker to realize that atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  The passage mentions that some theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The passage also mentions that the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The passage also indicates that the products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Therefore, the answer must be an option that addresses the expectation and perception of physicists during the experimental stage.
  Option B makes sense as it states that the lack of particular expectations concerning the nuclear composition of the by-products would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Option A is irrelevant to the question.
  Option C is untrue, as the passage mentions that several theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  Option D is unlikely to have an effect on the speed of realization that atoms were being split.
  Option E is irrelevant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage states that the physicists who conducted the neutron-bombardment experiments were not trying to split the atom. It implies that their inability to recognize that nuclear fission had occurred or was even possible had something to do with their preconceptions and expectations about what would happen. 
  Of the given choices, only option B addresses the suitable response to change their preconceptions, and it would have been most likely to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split. 
  Option A is irrelevant because the passage doesn't mention that use of similar techniques affected the recognition of nuclear fission. Option C is incorrect because the passage mentioned that some theoretical physicists had produced calculations that indicating it was in principle possible to break atoms apart, and the inability to recognize the significance of nuclear fission result was due to preconceptions. Option D is incorrect because the passage already mentioned that scientists compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without understanding it. Option E is irrelevant because the passage is focused on experiments with uranium.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The question asks about the factor that could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  According to the passage, the physicists had already done numerous experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium before the split of atoms was realized.
  The passage implies that the researchers were not receptive to the possibility of atoms being split.
  Therefore, the factor that could have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be something that could have made them receptive to the possibility of atoms being split.
  Choice B states that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products. If they did not have specific expectations, this could make them more open to different possibilities in interpreting their results.
  Therefore, B is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The passage states that a crucial theoretical connection that led to the discovery of nucleus splitting was provided when Lise Meitner, who was working on related research in Berlin, discovered a group of puzzling radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium while Enrico Fermi and others achieved similar results. However, these products remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
It seems that if it were true that the researchers did not have expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, then they would have been more receptive to other possibilities, such as the nuclear fission of Uranium atoms. Therefore, this would likely speed up their realization of atom splitting.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage states physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.
  The passage also mentions that Exploratory theoretical studies, simulating bond-breaking along various lines, had indicated that uranium, among other substances, was potentially susceptible to fission.
  It was difficult to recognize what was happening partly because of the expectation that products of uranium fission would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  It is reasonable to assume that if the physicists did not have such a strong expectation, they would be able to recognize that they were splitting atoms more quickly. Therefore, the answer is B: The physicists conducting the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes that the researchers compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission, but without recognizing it initially.
  Meitner was the one who recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the best way to reduce the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split would be by improving their theoretical knowledge to identify the significance of experimental data.
  Choice C suggests that the physicists conducting the experiments were not aware of calculations indicating that in principle, it was possible to split atoms.
  This aligns with the lesser theoretical knowledge of the researchers and can explain why it took longer for them to realize that uranium atoms were being split.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage describes that before the discovery of nuclear fission, some theoretical physicists had already produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to split atoms.
  The experiments on neutron bombardment were not aimed at achieving such a result and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner and Hahn discovered that one of the products resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been identified as barium, element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism Hahn envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, so she believed that the right conceptual link was a key for physicists to realize that atoms were being split.
  Hence, the answer is the choice that implies the existence of a right conceptual link.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage explains that even though some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result. The researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. 
  Furthermore, the products of uranium bombarded with neutrons remained unidentified partly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  It was only when Otto Hahn wrote to Lise Meitner of a surprising result in which one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, but should not have been possible, that it became clear that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  Therefore, the option that is most likely to have reduced the amount of time it took for physicists to realize that atoms were being split is the one that would have led them to expect the production of elements other than those close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Option B asserts that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the nuclear composition of the by-products. This option would have made it easier for them to identify that the element produced was not close to uranium in nuclear composition and that the uranium atoms had been split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The question asks for the factor that could have reduced the time taken for physicists to discover nuclear fission i.e. splitting of atoms.
  According to the passage, the physicists conducting experiments were not even receptive to the possibility that splitting of atoms can occur during neutron bombardment of uranium.
  If they have conducted experiments in search of any such new phenomenon, which is different from their initial objective, the time taken to discover nuclear fission could have been reduced.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Physicists conducted experiments in the neutron bombardment of some substance other than uranium.

Topic: Law
Context: During Dostoyevsky's time there were two significant and opposing directions in Russian literary criticism. One position maintained that art stood high above the present and the everyday, while the radical view maintained that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality, and, through the exposure of want and injustice, it contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful. Dostoyevsky took a third position. As a realist, he never doubted that reality was literature's crucial source. But his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics, since for Dostoyevsky there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, and reality was far more than the merely tangible. The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted "as it is" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky; reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it: what may not be reality for you may be reality for me. The task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world. Within perceptible "reality" exists another sphere, the fantastic, which is not in any way superfluous to a writer's concerns: "The fantastic must be so intimately bound up with the real that one almost believes in it." The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art "a shameful destiny." A literary work must stand or fall on its "artistic merit," he explained. The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms. Only fully realized artistic works could fulfill their goals. But what does it mean to say that a work is "artistic" ? Dostoyevsky defined it thus: "To say that a novelist is 'artistic'means that he possesses a talent to express his thoughts in characters and images so that when the reader has finished the novel, he has fully understood the author's thoughts. Therefore, artistry is quite simply the ability to write well." The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be "useful" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory. How can we know what will show itself to be useful? Can we say with assurance how useful the Iliad has been to humankind? No, Dostoyevsky believed, when it comes to this we encounter breadths that cannot be measured with any precision; sometimes a work of art may appear to deviate from reality and serve no useful purpose because we cannot see clearly what paths it may take to become useful.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the organization of the material presented in the passage?
Choices:
  A: Three positions are presented and each is elaborated in detail.
  B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
  C: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the second in detail.
  D: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be superior to the first two.
  E: Three positions are presented and the third is shown to be inferior to the second.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage presents three significant positions of Russian literary criticism.
  The first position maintains that art should be separate from the present and the everyday. 
  The second position maintained that art should depict and expose concrete reality and contribute to a new society. 
  The third position is presented through Dostoyevsky, who believes in realist writing but thinks reality is beyond the tangible and includes the sphere of the fantastic. 
  The passage also presents Dostoyevsky's perspective on the utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear. Dostoyevsky finds it a contradiction in terms. 
  The passage differentiates the third position from the first two and provides more detail on Dostoyevsky's view.
  Therefore, B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail is the most accurate description of the organizational structure of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first position believed that art was above everyday life.
  The second position believed that art should be useful by exposing want and injustice in order to create a new society.
  The third position, which Dostoyevsky took, believed that reality was literature's crucial source and that there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  The third position is further differentiated from the first two in detail, such as the understanding of reality, boundaries of the real world, and the role of the writer.
Action: Answer("B") 
Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage talks about Dostoyevsky's position towards two opposing positions in Russian literary criticism.
  One position maintains that art should stand high above the present and the everyday. 
  The other position maintains that art had a right to exist only if it found its sources in concrete reality and contributed to the creation of a new society; literature, in other words, should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position, which was a realist position.
  The passage then elaborates on Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality and what it means for a literary work to be "artistic".
  Throughout the passage, the third position is differentiated from the first two positions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about three positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first position claims that art is above the present and the everyday.
  The second position claims that literature should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The third position, held by Dostoyevsky, believes that reality is literature's crucial source and that it is shaped by the person experiencing it. The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  Therefore, the third position is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses three positions on Russian literary criticism.
  The first position maintains that art should be above the present and the everyday.
  The second position states that art should have concrete sources in reality and contribute to creating a new society.
  The third position taken by Dostoyevsky argues that reality is the crucial source of literature, but also includes the fantastic.
  The passage then goes on to explain Dostoyevsky's view of what makes a work artistic.
  It also explains Dostoyevsky's opposition to the idea that art must be "useful".
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage presents two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.
  Dostoyevsky took a third position that differed from the first two positions.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality went deeper than that of the other critics.
  The writer must explore "the fantastic" within the boundaries of reality.
  The radical critics' emphasis on utility was unsatisfactory for Dostoyevsky.
  Therefore, the organization of the passage is not restricted to presenting and comparing three positions; instead, it represents the author's views through the presentation of different themes.
  
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses three positions regarding literary criticism.
  The first position suggests that art should be above the present and everyday.
  The second position maintains that art must reflect concrete reality and contribute to shaping society.
  Dostoyevsky is then introduced as taking a third position that goes deeper into reality than the second position.
  Dostoyevsky believes that reality is shaped by the person who experiences it and that the fantastic must be intimately bound up with the real.
  Dostoyevsky argues that the proper purpose of art is artistic merit, and that utilitarianism is an inadequate criterion to measure a work's usefulness to society.

Organization:
  The passage presents three positions, but the third one is the most elaborated one.
  Dostoyevsky's position is different from both the other two positions, but the text is not focused on showing that Dostoyevsky's belief is superior.
  Based on the above analysis, the most accurate description of the organization of the material presented in the passage is that three positions are presented and the third is differentiated from the first two in detail. The answer is B.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage AEvolutionary psychology has taught us to examine human behavior from the standpoint of the theory of evolution—to explain a given type of human behavior by examining how it contributes to the reproductive success of individuals exhibiting the behavior, and thereby to the proliferation of the genetic material responsible for causing that behavior. From an evolutionary standpoint, the problem of altruism is a thorny one: what accounts for the evolution of behavior in which an individual expends energy or other valuable resources promoting the welfare of another individual? The answer probably lies in the psychological experiences of identification and empathy. Such experiences could have initially arisen in response to cues (like physical resemblance) that indicated the presence of shared genetic material in human ancestors. The psychological states provoked by these cues could have increased the chances of related individuals' receiving assistance, thereby enhancing the survival and replication of genes influencing the capacity for identification and empathy. This would account, for example, for a mother's rushing to help her injured child; genes promoting their own self-propagation may thus operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish. Since human ancestors lived in small, kin-based groups, the application of altruistic mechanisms to the entire group would have promoted the propagation of the genes responsible for those mechanisms. Later, these mechanisms may have come to apply to humans who are not kin when communities grew larger. In this way, apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system. Passage B Evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory; that is, it explains behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or indeed, is not even aware of. Thus, what seemed to be your unsurprising interest in your child's well-being turns out to be your genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves. Such arguments can appear persuasive on the face of it. According to some evolutionary psychologists, an interest in the proliferation of genes explains monogamous families in animals whose offspring mature slowly. Human offspring mature slowly; and, at least in numerical terms, our species favors monogamous families. Evolutionary psychologists take this as evidence that humans form monogamous families because of our interest in propagating our genes. Are they right? Maybe yes, maybe no; this kind of inference needs to be handled with great care. There are, most often, all sorts of interests that would explain any given behavior. What is needed to make it decisive that a particular interest explains a particular behavior is that the behavior would be reasonable only if one had that interest. But such cases are vanishingly rare: an interest in Y might explain doing X, but so too would an interest in doing X. A concern to propagate one's genes would explain promoting the welfare of one's children; but so too would an interest in the welfare of one's children. Not all of one's motives can be instrumental, after all; there must be some things that one cares for just for their own sakes.
Question: Which one of the following assertions from passage A most clearly exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" (lines 35–36)?
Choices:
  A: Evolutionary psychologists seek to examine human behavior from the point of view of the theory of evolution.
  B: Altruism presents a difficult problem for evolutionary psychology.
  C: An altruistic individual uses valuable resources to promote the well-being of another individual.
  D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
  E: Early humans lived in small, kin-based groups.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author of passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology for interpreting behavior in terms of proliferation of genes.
  This is similar to a conspiracy theory in which the agent's interest is hidden from view.
  An example of this is that parental care is not just an interest in one's children's welfare but an expression of a hidden motivation to propagate self-interest.
  The most likely answer that exemplifies what the author of passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Passage B criticizes evolutionary psychology, calling it a "conspiracy theory".
  It describes how evolutionary psychology imputes an interest - the proliferation of genes - that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  To show an example of this, passage A argues that genes promoting their own self-propagation may operate through instinctive actions that appear unselfish.
  The author argues that this shows how apparently altruistic mechanisms may have arisen within a genetically "selfish" system, demonstrating the imputed interest in the proliferation of genes.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Passage B states that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior in a way that is not openly acknowledged or even aware of.
  The author of Passage A describes how genes may promote their self-propagation through seemingly unselfish behaviors.
  Therefore, D: "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" best exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The author of Passage B believes that evolutionary psychology explains behavior in a way that can be compared to a conspiracy theory.
The author of Passage A describes how genes can promote their own self-propagation through actions that help related individuals (e.g., a mother helping her child).
Therefore, Passage A exemplifies what the author of Passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory".
The answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage B states evolutionary psychology is a kind of conspiracy theory that explains behavior through hidden interests not acknowledged by the agent.
  The author of Passage A discusses how genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish, such as a mother rushing to help her injured child.
  Answer choice D, which states "Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish" is consistent with the idea that evolutionary psychology is a conspiracy theory.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology is similar to a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior through imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or is not aware of.
  Passage A discusses the issue of altruism and how the evolution of altruistic behavior can be explained by genes promoting their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The author of passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  In a conspiracy theory, behavior is explained by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  We need to identify an assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies this description.
  The author of passage A suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear altruistic, such as a mother's rushing to help her injured child, and that the application of altruistic mechanisms to an entire group would have promoted the propagation of genes responsible for those mechanisms.
  This assertion exemplifies the idea that an interest in self-propagation explains behavior that is not openly acknowledged because it suggests that seemingly altruistic behavior is actually motivated by an evolutionary interest in propagating genes.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a "conspiracy theory" because it tries to explain behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  In other words, passage B thinks that evolutionary psychology's focus on explaining behavior from an evolutionary standpoint is based on a kind of conspiracy theory.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies this perspective.
  Statements that explain the focus or problems of evolutionary psychology do not exemplify the claim in Passage B.
  Similarly, statements that explain the reasons or mechanisms behind behavior do not exemplify the claim.
  However, the statement that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies this claim.
  By this logic, evolutionary psychologists see apparent altruism as genetic "selfishness" with the goal of propagating genes.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest (the propagation of genes) that is not acknowledged by the agent of the behavior.
  An assertion that exemplifies this idea will contain an explanation of human behavior based on the propagation of genes.
  Choice A, B, C, and E do not exemplify what Passage B means by calling evolutionary psychology a conspiracy theory.
  Choice D provides an explanation of genes promoting self-propagation through actions that may appear unselfish.
  Therefore, the best answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A and B use the term "conspiracy theory" differently.
  Passage B uses it to mean the explanation of behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) without evidence.
  Passage A does not use it to imply that evolutionary psychology is baseless or unfounded; instead, it acknowledges the difficulty of determining an evolutionary explanation for altruism.
  The assertion that best exemplifies what the author of passage B calls a "conspiracy theory" is the one that imputes an unconscious motive to an individual behavior without supporting evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish.

Topic: Law
Context: In studying the autobiographies of Native Americans, most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators—that emerged from "bicultural composite authorship." Limiting their studies to such written documents, these scholars have overlooked traditional, preliterate modes of communicating personal history. In addition, they have failed to address the cultural constructs of the highly diverse Native American peoples, who prior to contact with nonindigenous cultures did not share with Europeans the same assumptions about self, life, and writing that underlie the concept of an autobiography— that indeed constitute the English word's root meaning. The idea of self was, in a number of pre-contact Native American cultures, markedly inclusive: identity was not merely individual, but also relational to a society, a specific landscape, and the cosmos. Within these cultures, the expression of life experiences tended to be oriented toward current events: with the participation of fellow tribal members, an individual person would articulate, reenact, or record important experiences as the person lived them, a mode of autobiography seemingly more fragmented than the European custom of writing down the recollections of a lifetime. Moreover, expression itself was not a matter of writing but of language, which can include speech and signs. Oral autobiography comprised songs, chants, stories, and even the process whereby one repeatedly took on new names to reflect important events and deeds in one's life. Dance and drama could convey personal history; for example, the advent of a vision to one person might require the enactment of that vision in the form of a tribal pageant. One can view as autobiographical the elaborate tattoos that symbolized a warrior's valorous deeds, and such artifacts as a decorated shield that communicated the accomplishments and aspirations of its maker, or a robe that was emblazoned with the pictographic history of the wearer's battles and was sometimes used in reenactments. Also autobiographical, and indicative of high status within the tribe, would have been a tepee painted with symbolic designs to record the achievements and display the dreams or visions of its owner, who was often assisted in the painting by other tribal members. A tribe would, then, have contributed to the individual's narrative not merely passively, by its social codes and expectations, but actively by joining in the expression of that narrative. Such intercultural collaboration may seem alien to the European style of autobiography, yet any autobiography is shaped by its creator's ideas about the audience for which it is intended; in this sense, autobiography is justly called a simultaneous individual story and cultural narrative. Autobiographical expressions by early Native Americans may additionally have been shaped by the cultural perspectives of the people who transmitted them.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately conveys the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" as it is used in line 5 of the passage?
Choices:
  A: written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture
  B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product
  C: compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined
  D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture
  E: written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage explains a situation where the autobiographies of Native Americans have been studied and have mainly been from "bicultural composite authorship."
  
  The author describes that "bicultural composite authorship" means most scholars have focused on as-told-to life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the authorship of most as-told-to life histories of Native Americans.
  According to the passage, these life histories were "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators".
  "Bicultural" means involving or combining two different cultures.
  "Composite" means made up of distinct parts or elements.
  Therefore, "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the collaboration between Native American and non-Native American collaborators to create recorded life histories.
  Since option A refers only to artifacts and oral traditions of another culture, it is not entirely accurate.
  Option B suggests that two people contribute equally, when in reality, Native American collaborators likely had less input and power in the process.
  Option C is not supported by the passage.
  Option D is mostly accurate but doesn't highlight the bicultural nature of the authorship.
  Option E is similar to option A.
  The best answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage describes the limitations of scholarship that have focused on written documents that have been produced through collaborations between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators. This collaboration is referred to as "bicultural composite authorship."
The author further explains how these written documents overlook traditional and preliterate modes of communicating personal history that were prevalent among the Native American peoples.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- "bicultural" suggests the involvement of two cultures.
- "composite authorship" probably signals that different authors from different cultures were part of the creation process.
- the preceding sentence refers to "life histories that were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
- combining these three thoughts suggests that the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the contribution of both Native American and non-Native American authors, who together created written life histories.
- looking at the choices,
    - A: does not necessarily indicate the involvement of non-Native people in the creation of the life histories.
    - B: is similar to the thought process, except that it suggests two people contributed to each piece of writing.
    - C: is probably incorrect, since the context of the writing project seems to involve the identification of authors.
    - D: this choice directly mentions Native Americans and non-Native Americans as the two contributors to the project.
    - E: seems to relate to the Native American input into the writing process, but doesn't refer to the involvement of non-Native Americans.
- So, the closest answer is D.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" is used in the context of discussing life histories of Native Americans solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
The phrase means a collaborative effort by two or more people with different cultural identities to produce a written document, namely, autobiographies of Native Americans.
Option A ("written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture") suggests that the writings are based on oral or written traditions and artifacts, which is not necessarily true. Furthermore, the option does not address the collaborative and composite nature of the authorship.
Option B ("written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product") suggests that the authors belong to different cultures and contribute equally to the finished product. While it is possible that collaborative efforts include authors of equal standing, there is no indication of such in the passage. Furthermore, the option limits the authorship to two people, which is not necessarily true.
Option C ("compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined") suggests that the authorship is compiled from writings, not necessarily autobiographies, of people of different cultures. Furthermore, the identities of the authors are not necessarily unknown or indeterminate, as the passage explicitly says that the autobiographies were "solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
Option D ("written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture") suggests that the writing is the product of editing and revisions done by members of different cultures. This option is closer in meaning to the phrase used in the passage, but it does not indicate the composite nature of the authorship, which involves multiple types of collaboration between the authors.
Option E ("written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture") suggests that the writing is based on oral communication by a member of another culture. This option does not capture the collaborative and composite nature of the authorship that involves multiple types of collaboration.
The best option that captures the meaning of the phrase "bicultural composite authorship" would be D: "written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture." The phrase implies a multi-step process involving multiple collaborators working together to produce the final written product.
Response 5:
Thought:
  The subject of the sentence "bicultural composite authorship" is the as-told-to life histories.
  The prefix "bi-" means two so it refers to two different cultures that collaborated in writing the life histories.
  The clue in the sentence is that the life histories "were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators."
  This means a Native American person was sharing their life story with non-Native Americans who helped translate the story into a written document.
  Therefore, because the life histories were written with the helping hand of a non-Native American person, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Formula: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The passage suggests that the autobiographies of Native Americans that were studied by scholars were developed through collaboration between Native Americans and non-Native American collaborators, which is ‘composite authorship.’ 
The phrase 'bicultural composite authorship' is used to qualify what specifically this collaboration comprised of.
The passage states that the life histories that scholars focused on in studying the autobiographies of Native Americans emerge from 'bicultural composite authorship.'
The phrase is describing a certain type of written autobiography written via collaboration between Native American and non-Native American collaborators.
The answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to a type of as-told-to life history.
  This type of life history emerged from collaboration between a Native American and a non-Native American collaborator.
  The phrase "composite authorship" suggests that two or more authors are involved in the writing process.
  The "bicultural" component of the phrase suggests that there are two distinct cultural perspectives being represented in the written document.
  Choice B suggests that two people from different cultures contribute in the same way, which is inaccurate because the non-Native American collaborator would likely have an editorial role.
  Choices A and E suggest that the writing is based on artifacts and oral traditions, which is not necessarily true for "bicultural composite authorship."
  Choice C suggests that the identities of the authors are unknown, which is not the case.
  Choice D accurately reflects the collaborative nature of the writing process involved in "bicultural composite authorship."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The phrase "bicultural composite authorship" refers to the most common type of Native American autobiographies that have been studied by non-Native American scholars. 
According to the passage, this type of autobiography is recorded and edited by non-Native American collaborators based on oral traditions and artifacts of Native Americans. 
Therefore, the answer is D: written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The term "bicultural composite authorship" is mentioned in reference to certain written accounts of Native American autobiographical narratives.
  The term describes a process of creating as-told-to life histories that involve collaborations between Native Americans and non-native Americans.
  The collaborations involve solicitation, translation, recording, and editing.
  Therefore, both Native Americans and non-native Americans contribute to the finished product.
  The answer is B: written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product.

Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Research concerning happiness and wealth reveals a paradox: at any one time richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer people in the same society report, and yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. Apparently, people are comparing their income with some norm, and that norm must be rising along with actual income. Two phenomena—habituation and rivalry—push up the norm. When our living standards increase, we love it initially but then we adjust and it makes little difference. For example, if we ask people with different incomes what income they consider sufficient, the "required income" correlates strongly with their actual income: a rise in actual income causes a roughly equivalent rise in required income. We can also look at reported happiness over time. Job satisfaction depends little on the absolute level of wages but rises if wages rapidly increase. We do not have the same experience with other aspects of our lives. We do not foresee how we adjust to material possessions, so we overinvest in acquiring them, at the expense of leisure. Now consider the phenomenon of rivalry. In a study conducted by Solnick and Hemenway, people were asked to choose between two options, with all prices held constant: A. You earn $50,000 a year while everyone else earns $25,000; B. You earn $100,000 a year while others make $200,000. The majority chose the first. They were happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improved. And indeed, how people compare to their "reference group" һthose most like them—is crucial for happiness. In East Germany, for example, living standards have soared since 1990, but the level of happiness has plummeted because people now compare themselves with West Germans, rather than with people in other Soviet bloc countries. Passage B Does the Solnick and Hemenway study mean that we care most about one-upmanship? Perhaps out of our primeval past comes the urge to demonstrate our superiority in order to help ensure mating prospects, keeping our genetic lines going. Still programmed like this, we get unexplainable pleasure from having a bigger house than our neighbors. This theory may sound good and is commonly heard, but it is not the explanation best supported by the evidence. Rather, the data show that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value. If two people feel equally successful, they will be equally happy even if their incomes differ greatly. Of course, people who earn more generally view themselves as successful. But it is the success—not the money per se-that provides the happiness. We use material wealth to show not just that we are prosperous, but that we are prosperous because we create value. What scholars often portray as an ignoble tendency-wanting to have more than others- is really evidence of a desire to create value. Wanting to create value benefits society. It is a bonus that it also brings happiness.
Question: Which one of the following pairs most accurately describes why the authors of passage A and passage B, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway?
Choices:
  A: to present a view that will be argued against to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon
  C: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided
  D: to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon to introduce the main topic to be discussed
  E: to introduce the main topic to be discussed to present a view that will be argued against
Response 0:
Thought:
  The mention of the Solnick and Hemenway study in Passage A shows that human beings compare their income with some norm and that the norm must be rising along with actual income. People are happy about their income and the feeling of superiority over a reference group. The mention of the same study in Passage B suggests that relative prosperity makes people feel happy and successful. It shows that earning more makes people happier because they feel that they are successful and have created value.
  Both passages present different concepts regarding happiness, superiority and success. Passage A presents the idea of rival consciousness with income, while Passage B presents the idea of relative prosperity in order to feel successful. Therefore, the authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon (Option D).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks about the purpose of mentioning the Solnick and Hemenway study.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study was presented to explain how people compare themselves with their reference group and how relative prosperity makes people feel successful.
  Passage A uses the study to explain how people compare their income with some norm, how habituation and rivalry push up the norm, and how people are happy to be poorer, provided their relative position improves.
  Passage B uses the study to argue that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful, that they have created value.
  Therefore, passage A mentions Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon; passage B mentions Solnick and Hemenway study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A describes that how our comparison with others effect our happiness and that comparison is important in determining our happiness.
  Passage B states that earning more money makes people happier because it makes them feel like they are successful and that there is a desire to create value.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in Passage A to suggest the importance of comparison with those who belong to our "reference group" i.e. those people who are similar to us whereas it is mentioned in Passage B to support the argument that people feel happier when they feel successful, even if they earn less than someone else.
  Therefore, the answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A and passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway.
  It is asked why these authors mention the study.
  In passage A, Solnick and Hemenway are mentioned to provide evidence for how people compare their income with some norm and that people's happiness depends on their relative position among their reference group.
  In passage B, Solnick and Hemenway are mentioned to argue against a commonly heard theory that people derive happiness from one-upmanship.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The authors of passage A mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to explain how people measure their happiness in relation to others and how relative prosperity makes them feel successful.
  The authors of passage B mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway to provide evidence that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they have created value.
  Therefore, Passage A and Passage B have mentioned the same study to provide different angles and evidence for the phenomenon.
  Choice B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon seems appropriate.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Both Passage A and Passage B mention Solnick and Hemenway's study.
  The reason for mentioning them differs between the two passages.
  Passage A mentions the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
  Passage B mentions the study to present a view that will be argued against.
  Therefore, the pair that most accurately describes why the authors of the two passages, respectively, mention the study by Solnick and Hemenway is B: to present a view that will be argued against to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A explains the paradox that people are happier in societies with lower incomes but that are more equal relative to their peers, whereas Passage B argues that the happiness comes from creating value as much as earning more. 
  The study by Solnick and Hemenway is used in Passage A to support the idea that people are happier by comparing themselves to others, while Passage B uses the same study to argue that people feel successful and create value and that these bring happiness.
  The two passages use the same source differently.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses a paradox regarding wealth and happiness.
  Passage B explains why earning more makes people happier.
  The Solnick and Hemenway study is mentioned in passage A to show that people compare themselves to others about income and in passage B to support the idea that relative prosperity makes people feel successful.
  Therefore, Passage A mentions the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon, and Passage B mentions the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A describes the Solnick and Hemenway study in the context of the paradox of happiness and wealth.
  Passage A uses the study to argue for the idea that people's sense of well-being is influenced by how they compare themselves to others in their society.
  Passage B refers back to the Solnick and Hemenway study and provides an alternative explanation that earning more makes people happier because it provides them with a sense of success and value creation.
  Passage B uses the study to provide evidence for this alternative explanation.
  Therefore, Passage A uses the study to present a view for which additional evidence will be provided, while Passage B uses the study to provide evidence for one explanation of a phenomenon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B describe different perspectives on the relationship between income and happiness.
  Passage A mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to present evidence that how people compare to their reference group is crucial for happiness.
  Passage B mentions the Solnick and Hemenway study to support the view that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful.
  The authors of Passage A and Passage B mention the Solnick and Hemenway study for different purposes.

Context: "Never was anything as incoherent, shrill, chaotic and ear-splitting produced in music. The most piercing dissonances clash in a really atrocious harmony, and a few puny ideas only increase the disagreeable and deafening effect." This remark aptly characterizes the reaction of many listeners to the music of Arnold Schoenberg. But this particular criticism comes from the pen of the dramatist August von Kotzebue, writing in 1806 about the overture to Beethoven's opera Fidelio. Both Beethoven and Schoenberg stirred controversy because of the way they altered the language and extended the expressive range of music. Beethoven, of course, has stood as a cultural icon for more than a century, but that didn't happen overnight. His most challenging works did not become popular until well into the twentieth century and, significantly, after the invention of the phonograph, which made repeated listening possible. Like Beethoven, Schoenberg worked in a constantly changing and evolving musical style that acknowledged tradition while simultaneously lighting out for new territory. This is true of the three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved. He began in the late-Romantic manner—music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies—that was pervasive in his youth. People who enjoy the music of Brahms ought to love Schoenberg's Verklaerte Nacht, and they usually do, once they get past the fact that they are listening to a piece by Schoenberg. Schoenberg later pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis. He did this in part because in his view it was the next inevitable step in the historical development of music, and he felt he was a man of destiny; he also did it because he needed to in order to express what he was compelled to express. Finally, he developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. In all three styles, Schoenberg operated at an awe-inspiring level of technical mastery. As his career progressed, his music became more condensed, more violent in its contrasts, and therefore more difficult to follow. But the real issue for any piece of music is not how it is made, but what it has to say. If Schoenberg hadn't existed, it would have been necessary to invent him, and not because of the 12-tone system, the seeds of which appear in Mozart. What makes Schoenberg's music essential is that he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before. Some of his work remains disturbing not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Though Schoenberg's music is more widely appreciated today than when he was alive, it is still regarded by many as shrill and incoherent.
  B: Because of his accomplishments as a composer,Schoenberg deserves to be as highly regarded as Beethoven.
  C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: Schoenberg is most important for his invention of the 12-tone technique of musical composition.
  E: Despite the fact that he wrote at a time when recordings of his compositions were possible, Schoenberg has not been accepted as quickly as Beethoven.

Topic: Law
Context: Because the market system enables entrepreneurs and investors who develop new technology to reap financial rewards from their risk of capital, it may seem that the primary result of this activity is that some people who have spare capital accumulate more. But in spite of the fact that the profits derived from various technological developments have accrued to relatively few people, the developments themselves have served overall as a remarkable democratizing force. In fact, under the regime of the market, the gap in benefits accruing to different groups of people has been narrowed in the long term. This tendency can be seen in various well-known technological developments. For example, before the printing press was introduced centuries ago, few people had access to written materials, much less to scribes and private secretaries to produce and transcribe documents. Since printed materials have become widely available, however, people without special position or resources—and in numbers once thought impossible—can take literacy and the use of printed texts for granted. With the distribution of books and periodicals in public libraries, this process has been extended to the point where people in general can have essentially equal access to a vast range of texts that would once have been available only to a very few. A more recent technological development extends this process beyond printed documents. A child in school with access to a personal computer and modem— which is becoming fairly common in technologically advanced societies—has computing power and database access equal to that of the best-connected scientists and engineers at top-level labs of just fifteen years ago, a time when relatively few people had personal access to any computing power. Or consider the uses of technology for leisure. In previous centuries only a few people with abundant resources had the ability and time to hire professional entertainment, and to have contact through travel and written communication—both of which were prohibitively expensive—with distant people. But now broadcast technology is widely available, and so almost anyone can have an entertainment cornucopia unimagined in earlier times. Similarly, the development of inexpensive mail distribution and telephone connections and, more recently, the establishment of the even more efficient medium of electronic mail have greatly extended the power of distant communication. This kind of gradual diffusion of benefits across society is not an accident of these particular technological developments, but rather the result of a general tendency of the market system. Entrepreneurs and investors often are unable to maximize financial success without expanding their market, and this involves structuring their prices to the consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population. In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately represents the primary function of the reference to maximization of financial success (lines 52–54)?
Choices:
  A: It forms part of the author's summary of the benefits that have resulted from the technological developments described in the preceding paragraph.
  B: It serves as the author's logical conclusion from data presented in the preceding paragraph regarding the social consequences of technological development.
  C: It forms part of a speculative hypothesis that the author presents for its interest in relation to the main topic rather than as part of an argument.
  D: It serves as part of a causal explanation that reinforces the thesis in the first paragraph regarding the benefits of technological development.
  E: It forms part of the author's concession that certain factors complicate the argument presented in the first two paragraphs.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The lines provide a reason why entrepreneurs and investors need to expand their market by structuring their prices for consumers so as to make their technologies genuinely accessible to an ever-larger share of the population.
  It says "In other words, because market competition drives prices down, it tends to diffuse access to new technology across society as a result."

Topic: Law
Context: It is generally believed that while in some cases government should intervene to protect people from risk—by imposing air safety standards, for example- in other cases, such as mountain climbing, the onus should be on the individual to protect himself or herself. In the eyes of the public at large, the demarcation between the two kinds of cases has mainly to do with whether the risk in question is incurred voluntarily. This distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk may in fact be the chief difference between lay and expert judgments about risk. Policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake; laypeople care a great deal whether a risk is undertaken voluntarily. However, judgments about whether a risk is "involuntary" often stem from confusion and selective attention, and the real reason for such judgments frequently lies in an antecedent judgment of some other kind. They are thus of little utility in guiding policy decisions. First, it is not easy to determine when a risk is voluntarily incurred. Although voluntariness may be entirely absent in the case of an unforeseeable collision with an asteroid, with most environmental, occupational, and other social risks, it is not an all-or-nothing matter, but rather one of degree. Risks incurred by airline passengers are typically thought to be involuntary, since passengers have no control over whether a plane is going to crash. But they can choose airlines on the basis of safety records or choose not to fly. In characterizing the risks as involuntary, people focus on a small part of a complex interaction, not the decision to fly, but the accident when it occurs. Second, people often characterize risks as "voluntary" when they do not approve of the purpose for which people run the risks. It is unlikely that people would want to pour enormous taxpayer resources into lowering the risks associated with skydiving, even if the ratio of dollars spent to lives saved were quite good. By contrast, people would probably not object to spending enormous resources on improving the safety of firefighters, even though the decision to become a firefighter is voluntary. In short, there is no special magic in notions like "voluntary" and "involuntary." Therefore, regulatory policy should be guided by a better understanding of the factors that underlie judgments about voluntariness. In general, the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction. Departures from this principle should be justified not by invoking the allegedly voluntary or involuntary nature of a particular risk, but rather by identifying the more specific considerations for which notions of voluntariness serve as proxies.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the author's attitude in the passage?
Choices:
  A: chagrin at the rampant misunderstanding of the relative risks associated with various activities
  B: concern that policy guided mainly by laypeople's emphasis on the voluntariness of risk would lead to excessive government regulation
  C: skepticism about the reliability of laypeople's intuitions as a general guide to deciding government risk-management policy
  D: conviction that the sole criterion that can justify government intervention to reduce risk is the saving of human lives
  E: eagerness to persuade the reader that policy experts' analysis of risk is distorted by subtle biases

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: The author's attitude regarding stealing thunder can most accurately be described as
Choices:
  A: concerned that the technique may become so common that lawyers will fail to recognize its drawbacks
  B: favorable toward its use by lawyers during the opening statements of a case but skeptical of its value otherwise
  C: concerned that research results supporting it may omit crucial anecdotal evidence indicating pitfalls in its use
  D: approving of its use on the grounds that its success is experimentally supported and can be psychologically explained
  E: skeptical of its suitability for use by lawyers without lengthy experience in courtroom strategies

Topic: Law
Context: The corrido, a type of narrative folk song, comes from a region half in Mexico and half in the United States known as the Lower Rio Grande Border. Corridos, which flourished from about 1836 to the late 1930s, are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain. Sung in Spanish, corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region. For example, "El Corrido de Kiansis" (c. 1870), the oldest corrido surviving in complete form, records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s. A single important event is likely to have inspired several corrido variants, yet the different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements. When sung at social gatherings, corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, but more importantly, their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities. Corridos take their name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments. Figures of speech such as metaphors are generally rare in corridos, and when metaphors are used, they usually incorporate everyday images that are familiar to the songs' listeners. In the popular "El Corrido de Gregorio Cortez," for example, the hero Cortez, fighting off pursuers, uses the metaphor of a thunderstorm to boast that he has had harder fights than the one they gave him: "I have weathered thunderstorms; / This little mist doesn't bother me." Similar storm imagery is found in other corridos including "Kiansis," which tells of stampedes caused by thunderstorms during the Kansas cattle drives. Such imagery, highly conventional and readily recognizable to corrido listeners, reflects and strengthens the continuity of the corrido tradition. The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another. This is most evident in the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida. The despedida of one variant of "Gregorio Cortez" is translated as follows: "Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez." The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme. In the despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, the corrido's maker asserts that the task of relating an authentic Border tale has been accomplished.
Question: Given its tone and content, from which one of the following was the passage most likely drawn?
Choices:
  A: a brochure for contemporary tourists to the Lower Rio Grande Border
  B: a study focusing on the ballad's influence on the music of eighteenth-century Spain

Topic: Law
Context: Industries that use biotechnology are convinced that intellectual property protection should be allowable for discoveries that stem from research and have commercial potential. Biotechnology researchers in academic institutions increasingly share this view because of their reliance on research funding that is in part conditional on the patentability of their results. However, questions about the extent to which biotechnology patenting is hindering basic research have recently come to the fore, and the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions are now the focus of increased scrutiny by scientists and policy makers. The perceived threat to basic research relates to restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences, cell lines, and genetically altered animals. These restrictions are seen as arising either from enforcement of a patent right or through operation of a contractual agreement. Some researchers fear that patenting biological materials will result in the patent holder's attempting or threatening to enjoin further research through a legal action for patent infringement. In other instances, a patent holder or the owner of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to scientists conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. For example, the holder of a patent on unique biological materials may want to receive a benefit or compensation for the costs invested in the creation of the material. Academic researchers who oppose biotechnology patents fear that corporate patent holders will charge prohibitively high fees for the right to conduct basic research involving the use of patented materials. While it is true that the communal tradition of freely sharing research materials has shifted to a market model, it is also undoubtedly true that even in the early days of biotechnology, some researchers took measures to prevent competitors from gaining access to materials they had created. Scientists who resist the idea of patenting biotechnology seem to be confusing patent rights with control of access to biological materials. They mistakenly assume that granting a patent implies granting the right to deny access. In reality, whether a patent could or would be enforced against a researcher, particularly one conducting basic and noncommercial research, is questionable. First, patent litigation is an expensive endeavor and one usually initiated only to protect a market position occupied by the patent holder or an exclusive patent licensee. Second, there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. Moreover, it is likely that patents will actually spur rather than hinder basic research, because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate. Researchers know that patents bring economic rewards as well as a degree of licensing control over the use of their discoveries.
Question: Suppose a university researcher wants to conduct basic, noncommercial research involving cell lines patented by a for-profit biotechnology corporation. The author would be most likely to make which one of the following predictions about the researcher's prospects?
Choices:
  A: The researcher will probably be unable to use the cell lines because the corporation holding the patent will demand a prohibitively high payment for their use.
  B: The corporation holding the patent will probably successfully sue the researcher for patent infringement if she conducts the research without permission.
  C: The university that employs the researcher will likely prohibit the research in an effort to avoid being sued by the corporation holding the patent.
  D: The researcher has a good chance of not being held liable for patent infringement if she conducts the research and is subsequently sued.
  E: The corporation will probably offer to fund the research if granted exclusive rights to any resulting marketable product.

  The question asks what is most likely to happen in the given scenario.
  The passage suggests that researchers are likely to be able to conduct basic, non-commercial research using patented materials without facing legal action for patent infringement.
Action: Answer ("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The passage suggests that academic researchers opposing biotechnology patents fear that patent holders of biological materials may refuse to make such materials available to researchers conducting basic research unless a costly materials-transfer agreement or license agreement is undertaken. 
- The author also notes that there has been a tradition among judges deciding patent cases to respect a completely noncommercial research exception to patent infringement. 
- And because patents provide scientists with a compelling incentive to innovate, it's likely that patents will spur rather than hinder basic research.
- Therefore, it's unlikely that the corporation holding the patent will prohibit the researcher from conducting noncommercial research using the cell lines.
- Additionally, it's possible that the corporation may allow the researcher to access the biological materials for non-commercial research purposes without charge or at a lower fee.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with which one of the following statements regarding the subtractive method?
Choices:
  A: Because the subtractive method masks distributed brain functions, empirical results derived using the method are invalid for medical applications.
  B: The subtractive method results in images that strongly support Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  C: Brain scans of individuals experiencing anger that were produced using the subtractive method show that emotions are not actually seated in the amygdala.
  D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
  E: The view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the method.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  According to the passage, the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  It gives a false impression of functional localization.
  The author does not agree that the images created by the subtractive method strongly support the modular theory of mind, and he considers Uttal's view as a valid critique of the modular theory.
  Therefore, the author is most likely to agree that the subtractive method creates an illusion of localized brain functions that supports the modular theory of mind.
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
The passage provides an explanation of how the subtractive method works.
The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to give an interpretation as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
In the subtractive method, all the distributed functions take place in both the control condition and the condition where subjects perform a cognitive task.
There is an impression of functional localization given by the differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
The author uses this information to point out that the subtractive method can be misleadingly appealing in supporting the modular theory of mind because the procedure provides illusions that brain functions are localized.
However, the author does not specifically discredit the subtractive method or its empirical results.
Therefore, the most likely answer would be D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The subtractive method produces brain scans that involve subtracting out distributed brain functions.
  The author suggests that the subtractive method produces an overemphasis on the idea of functional localization.
  The author does not suggest that the subtractive method invalidates all empirical results, nor does he suggest that the method supports Uttal's view that mental processes are entirely general.
  The author does not provide any evidence to suggest that the subtractive method reveals that emotions are not seated in the amygdala.
  The passage does state that the subtractive method produces images that seem to support the modular theory of the mind, but the author is critical of this connection.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
The author is criticizing the modular theory of mind and how the brain scan's subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
The author is not criticizing the subtractive method in itself and does not present evidence that invalidates empirical results produced through the method. 
The author is also not saying that the subtractive method strongly supports Uttal's view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
The author argues that the modular theory of mind is not proven. So, D cannot be the answer.
The author explains how the subtractive method works and its potential issues such as obscuring the entire brain's activity. The passage doesn't explicitly suggest that the view that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain is based on a fundamental misconception of the subtraction method.
 
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
The passage suggests that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and this method leads to false impressions of neat functional localization. 
The passage does not suggest that the method is invalid for medical applications, nor does it mention any support for Uttal's view of mental processes. 
The passage suggests contention with the claim that emotions are seated in a particular region. 
The passage suggests that the subtractive method creates an illusion of brain localization, so the author is not likely to agree that it strongly supports the modular theory of mind. 
The passage clarifies that the subtractive method depicts differential rates of oxygen use in the brain. 
Therefore, the most likely answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
The passage asserts that the subtractive method leads to images that give a false impression of neat functional localization while masking distributed brain functions because the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Hence, the author would not likely agree that the subtractive method strongly supports the modular theory of the mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
None of the other choices align well with the author's argument.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Although the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, the modular theory of mind may not be supported because of the subtraction process.
  Therefore, the author would be most likely to disagree with D - The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passge suggests that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and creates a false impression of neat functional localization. It appears that this goes against the idea of mental modularity. Therefore, the author of the passage would be least likely to agree with D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The author criticizes the use of the subtractive method as it masks that the entire brain is active in both control and cognitive task conditions, which results in an illusion that brain functions are localized. 
  The author also questions the validity of the modular theory of mind that claims brain functions are modular and therefore localized in specific brain regions. 
  The author does not make any statement regarding the use of the subtractive method for medical applications.
  The author does not support Uttal’s view that mental processes are simply properties of a more general mental activity.
  The author does not make any statement regarding the seat of emotions in the amygdala.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage describes both the usefulness and potential limitations of the subtractive method.
The author argues that the subtractive method shows only localized brain functions, and therefore the modular theory of mind may be incomplete or incorrect.
The author does not mention that empirical results produced by the subtractive method are invalid for medical applications.
The correct answer would acknowledge the method's limitations.

Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,
  E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as "lit up" with metabolic activity.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage talks about the modular theory of mind and brain scans related to psychological research. According to the passage, the modular theory of mind may not be valid as module processes may not be decomposable into independent modules. In addition, the passage explains that neuroimaging tools reveal well-defined areas that light up when performing cognitive tasks due to the subtractive method. The passage also highlights that the subtractive method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both control and on-task conditions. 
Option A is incorrect because the passage does not state that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. 
Option B is incorrect because the modular theory of mind does not hold that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero, this statement is not mentioned in the passage. 
Option C is correct because the passage explains that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. 
Option D is incorrect because the passage does not provide clear information on brain regions that have high metabolic activity at all times. 
Option E is incorrect because the specific example of anger is not discussed in the passage. 
Therefore, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage notes that the modular theory of mind, which suggests distinct areas of the brain are responsible for specific mental processes, may not be entirely valid.
  The FMRI method works by subtracting out the differential rate of oxygen use from a cognitive task from the baseline rate of oxygen use, creating an image of the areas of the brain that are more metabolically active.
  The author also notes that the process of subtracting the baseline obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and active conditions.
  The strongest supported statement seems to relate to the FMRI method and the metabolic activity of the brain during specific cognitive tasks.
  The passage does not suggest that most cognition depends on specific independent modules, as the author argues that the modular theory of mind may not be entirely valid.
  It also does not suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task will have a zero rate of oxygen use.
  The passage does not say anything about certain regions of the brain having consistently high metabolic activity.
  The statement that most closely matches the passage is that during certain cognitive tasks, areas of the brain that are most metabolically active will have a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage talks about brain scans as pictures of mental activity and the challenges of using them as a research method in psychology. The passage argues that the validity of using neuroimaging in psychology depends on a premise that "independent modules" of the mind can be identified in distinct regions of the brain. However, this modular theory of mind suggests that the mind can be broken down into separate and distinct modules, which the passage questions as being a simplified view of mental activity. The FMRI imaging technique produces images of the brain at work. The technique constructs these images through the differential method of comparing baseline measurements in the control condition with measurements while the subject is performing a cognitive task. By subtracting this baseline value, a map of brain activity for that cognitive task is produced. There is a problem with the method since it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
Action: Answer("C") 
The most strongly supported statement by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and how it is applied to neuroimaging in psychology.
  Brain scans as pictures of mental activity are different from scans in diagnosing a brain tumor.
  While the modular theory of mind posits independent modules in specific regions of the brain, a more general approach argues that various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  In functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), a baseline measurement is taken before a cognitive task is performed, so that the on-task measurement can be subtracted from it.
  The remainder is seen as the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  So, areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
The passage talks about how brain scans are used for diagnosing medical issues and psychological research, and how a premise called modularity theory of mind is used to analyze modular functioning of the brain. Different regions of the brain have differential metabolic activities and the subtractive method highlights localized metabolic activities. 
Option A: The passage does not support this statement. Rather, it presents critical questions regarding the validity of the modular theory of mind which posits that cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. 
Option B: The passage does not support this statement. There is no mention of the modular theory of mind holding anything concerning the rate of oxygen use of the regions of the brain. 
Option C: The passage supports this statement. The passage highlights how brain scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use, and the subtractive method produces images of brain regions that have high metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task in question.
Option D: The passage does not support this statement. It mentions taking baseline measurements of brain oxygen use but does not say anything about certain regions of the brain having high metabolic activity at all times.
Option E: The passage does not support this statement because the example of anger was only given to argue against the modularity of the brain.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
The passage talks about brain scans and the modular theory of mind.
The modular theory of mind assumes that mental processes are independent modules located in distinct regions of the brain.
However, this view is contested as it fails to consider that mental processes might be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces brain scans that are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use.
However, the interpretation of these images as evidence of specific cognitive functions localized in specific brain regions is misleading because the entire brain is active all the time.
Therefore, the most strongly supported statement by the passage is that "During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain." This is in line with the passage which says that the FMRI scan shows the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain where areas involved in cognitive tasks has a higher rate of oxygen use than their corresponding areas during resting state scanning. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage criticizes the modular theory of mind for assuming that the mind can be divided into distinct modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage indicates that the subtractive method used in FMRI imaging does not show the whole picture of brain activity and can give a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The passage suggests that the entire brain is active in both control and experimental conditions.
  The passage highlights that the modular theory of mind is illustrated well by the outputs of the subtractive method.
  Choice A is contradicted by the first paragraph and the critique of the modular theory of mind throughout the passage.
  Choice B is not supported by the passage; in fact, the passage indicates that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Choice D is irrelevant to the question.
  Choice E is not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the use of brain scans to study brain activity.
  It also critiques the modular theory of mind, which posits that mental activity can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules in localized brain regions.
  The passage explains that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on this premise.
  However, it argues that this premise may not be accurate.
  FMRI, which is a popular method for brain scanning, produces brain maps that show the differential rate of oxygen use during cognitive tasks.
  One problem with FMRI is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, to determine which statement is most strongly supported by the passage, we need to examine which statement is most closely related to the points discussed in the passage.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The passage talks about the use of brain scans in psychology as a different enterprise.
The modular theory of mind is a premise of the use of neuroimaging in psychology, however, it may be that there's no distinct entities or modules.
FMRI depicts differential rate of oxygen use. It subtracts the baseline measurement in the control condition to get a reference point.
The method devolves the false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions.
There's no statement in the passage supporting A, B, or D.
C is somewhat correct regarding FMRI inputs and subtractive method. 
E is more accurate in talking about the results when it comes to the emotions and the brain.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
- The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans in psychology.
- The modular theory of mind argues that the mind can be analyzed into separate modules instantiated in localized brain regions, but this premise is debatable.
- The passage also explains that brain scans reveal well-defined areas of the brain that "light up," but this may not necessarily support the modular theory of mind.
- The passage describes the subtractive method used in brain scans to show the metabolic activity associated solely with a cognitive task.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A In this appeal of his criminal conviction, the defendant challenges the fingerprint evidence used against him at trial, claiming that fingerprint identification theory has not been adequately tested. He cites the inability of the fingerprint examiner who incriminated him at trial to name any studies establishing that no two persons have identical fingerprints. The defendant claims that there are no established error rates revealing how often :fingerprint examiners incorrectly identifY a fingerprint as a particular person's, and asserts that fingerprint examiners lack uniform, objective standards. He cites testimony given by the fingerprint examiner at trial that there is no generally accepted standard regarding the number of "points of identification" required for a positive identification. Although fingerprint identification has not attained the status of scientific law, it has been used in criminal trials for 100 years, and experts have long concurred about its reliability. While further testing and the development of even more consistent standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. While it may be true that different agencies require different degrees of correlation before permitting a positive identification, fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. As the fingerprint expert testified at the defendant's trial, examiners are regularly subjected to testing and proficiency requirements, and uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review. The trial court below was therefore within its diseretion in erediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate. Passage B Fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match." There is simply no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis fur identification. Some examiners use a "point-counting" method that entails counting the number of similar "ridge" characteristics on prints, but there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed, and local practices vary. Others reject point counting for a more holistic approach. Either way, there is no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Although we know that different individuals can share certain ridge characteristics, the chance of two individuals sharing any given number of identifying characteristics is unknown. How likely is it that two people could have four points of resemblance, or five, or eight? Moreover, fingerprints used in forensic identification are typically partial and smndged. Are the odds that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion? No :fingerprint examiner can answer such questions decisively, yet the answers are critical to evaluating the value of fingerprint evidence. The error rate for fingerprint identification in actoal practice has received little systematic study. How often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match? Although some proficiency tests show examiners making few or no errors, these tests have been criticized as lax; a more rigorous test showed a 34 percent rate of erroneous identification.
Question: The authors would be most likely to disagree about
Choices:
  A: whether uniformity in the training of fingerprint examiners is desirable
  B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given eriminal case
  C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law
  D: the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification
  E: whether different agencies vary in the degree of correlation they require for examiners to declare a match
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is a reliable form of evidence.
  Passage B suggests that fingerprint identification lacks objective standards and has an unknown error rate.
  The authors disagree about the reliability and objectivity of fingerprint identification.
  Therefore, choice B about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case is the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification is reliable. It states that examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification. The fingerprint expert testified that there is an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B argues that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for identification. It states that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match."
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about whether fingerprint identification has a low error rate or if no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match exists.
  The answer is B: the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A believes that fingerprint identification has been reliably used for 100 years and although further testing and development of uniform standards may be desirable, this court sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time. It also claims that uniform standards have been established through professional training and peer review, and therefore, the trial court was within its discretion in accrediting testimony that fingerprint identification has an exceedingly low error rate.
  Passage B claims that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for identifying matches and that there is no consensus about what constitutes a sufficient basis for fingerprint identification. It points out that there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed and that local practices vary. It also mentions that the error rate for fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  From this, it can be concluded that the authors disagree about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the uniformity of standards for fingerprint examiners.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that despite challenges, fingerprint identification is reliable and has established error rates. It concludes that the trial court was correct in accepting fingerprint evidence against the defendant.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints match. It outlines problems with the "point-counting" method and emphasizes the need for more precise, scientific standards when evaluating fingerprint evidence.
  The authors agree that there are some differences among agencies in the degree of correlation they require before declaring a match.
  The authors disagree about whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law, with Passage A indicating that it is reliable but has not achieved the status of scientific law, while Passage B suggests that current methods lack scientific rigor.
  Overall, the authors disagree most about the reliability and error rates of fingerprint identification.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Passage A supports the use of fingerprint identification evidence.
  In Passage A, it is stated that fingerprint examiners are held to a consistent "points and characteristics" approach to identification.
  On the other hand, Passage B presents criticisms and issues with fingerprint identification evidence, such as a lack of objective standards for evaluating a match and a lack of knowledge of error rates.
  Therefore, the authors appear to disagree on whether fingerprint identification evidence is reliable and objective.
  The correct answer is C: whether fingerprint identification should be accorded the status of scientific law.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A and Passage B express different views on the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage A is in favor of fingerprint identification and sees it as reliable.
  Passage B is critical of fingerprint identification and sees it as unreliable.
  Passage A believes that there are uniform, objective standards for fingerprint identification.
  Passage B believes that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match."
  Passage A thinks that the trial court was correct in allowing fingerprint identification as evidence in this particular case.
  Passage B highlights that there is no fixed requirement about how many points of similarity are needed for a match.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to disagree about the relative merits of the point-counting and holistic methods of fingerprint identification.
Answer: D
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses how experts have long concurred about the reliability of fingerprint identification and the court sees no reason to reject a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time.
  Passage B describes how fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and how no fingerprint examiner can answer questions decisively about how likely is it that two partial prints from different people will match one in a thousand, one in a million, or one in a billion or how often do fingerprint examiners mistakenly declare a match.
  Therefore, they would most likely disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case, choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A indicates that fingerprint identification has long been used in criminal trials and it is reliable.
  The author of Passage A believes there is no reason to reject fingerprint identification as evidence.
  Passage B, however, criticises the lack of consensus and objective standards for evaluating prints for identification.
  The author of Passage B doubts the reliability and accuracy of fingerprint identification.
  The authors would be most likely to disagree about the "accuracy of fingerprint examiner's identification" because this is one of the key points of difference between the two passages.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The authors of passage A and passage B have different views regarding the reliability of fingerprint identification.
  Passage A suggests that fingerprint identification is reliable and has an exceedingly low error rate. Uniform standards and professional training have also been established to ensure the proficiency of fingerprint examiners.
  Passage B suggests that there is a lack of objective standards for fingerprint identification and no generally agreed-on standard for determining precisely when to declare a match. Furthermore, the error rate of fingerprint identification in actual practice has received little systematic study.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely disagree about the likelihood that a fingerprint examiner will incorrectly declare a match in a given criminal case.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that fingerprint identification theory has been used in criminal trials for 100 years and has withstood the test of time while admitting that further testing and development of consistent standards may be desirable.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints "match" and different examiners have different methods, potentially leading to errors.
  They both address the reliability of fingerprint identification, and Passage A asserts reliability while Passage B argues there is no consensus and cites studies that show errors. 
  They seem to disagree about whether there are consistent standards for fingerprint examiners.

Topic: Law
Context: Given the amount of time and effort that curators, collectors, dealers, scholars, and critics spend on formulating judgments of taste in relation to oil paintings, it seems odd that so few are prepared to apply some of the same skills in exploring works of art that stimulate another sense altogether: that of smell. Why is great perfume not taken more seriously? While art professionals are very serious about many branches of literature, architecture, and music, I have yet to find a curatorial colleague who regularly beats a path to the fragrance counter in search of, say, Joy Parfum, the 1930 masterpiece by Henri Almeras.And yet, the parallels between what ought to be regarded as sister arts are undeniable. Painters combine natural and, these days, synthetic pigments with media such as oils and resins, much as the perfumer carefully formulates natural and synthetic chemical compounds. The Old Masters deployed oil paint across the color spectrum, and applied layers on a determining ground and various kinds of underpainting, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top. Thus various types of mashed-up earth and vegetable suspended in linseed or poppy oil are brushed over a stretch of woven fabric. They begin to dry, and a picture is born. Its appearance changes over time, because the tendency of oil paint is to become gradually more transparent.So, too, talented "noses" experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy, as the case may be. These combinations change and develop in sequence or in unison as the substance and its constituents evaporate at different rates, some quickly, others slowly, thanks to the warmth of our skin. A brilliant perfumer may thus devise an imaginary world no less powerful, or intimate, than that of a great composer or painter, and in calling on our capacity to discover there some memory of childhood or of a long-forgotten experience, perfumers are in the same business as the artist who creates the illusion of life on canvas.Perhaps one reason that truly great smells are so often undervalued is that perfumes are today made and distributed under the not particularly watchful gaze of a few large corporations. The cynical bean counters in Paris and Zurich do not hesitate to tamper with old formulas, insisting on the substitution of cheap chemical compounds that approximately resemble rarer, better ingredients in an effort to increase profits. They do not tell their customers when or how they do this; indeed, they presume their customers won't notice the difference. Consequently, fine perfume is now hopelessly entangled with the international cosmetic dollar, and ill-served by marketing and public relations.
Question: The passage provides the most support for which one of the following statements about art?
Choices:
  A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
  B: In any work of art, one can detect the harmonious combination of many small sensations.
  C: A work of art will inevitably fail if it is created for the sake of commercial success.
  D: The best works of art improve with age.
  E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarity between the art of painting and the art of creating perfumes.
  It highlights how these two arts involve a combination of different elements to create a unique effect.
  The passage also considers why perfumes may be undervalued and why they are sometimes created without a focus on preserving quality.
  Based on this, the passage provides the most support for A and B.
  The passage suggests that a work of art (perfumes) can evoke memories and that the combination of elements creates unique sensations.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage compares the making of perfume to painting, music, and literature.
  The passage discusses the techniques used in painting and the creation of perfumes.
  The passage suggests that perfumes are undervalued because they are made and distributed by a few large corporations.
  The passage discusses the ability of great works of art to create an aesthetic experience.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how great perfume is not taken seriously.
  The author argues that parallels can be drawn between painting and perfumery.
  The author argues that a great perfumer can devise an imaginary world as powerful as that of a great painter or composer.
  Furthermore, the author criticizes large corporations for tampering with old formulas to increase profits.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for this statement: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between perfumers and other artists.
  Like painters, perfumers carefully combine natural and synthetic elements.
  Like painters, perfumers build up layers to create the finished work.
  The appearance of oil paintings changes over time, and perfumes change as their constituents evaporate.
  Perfumers may be creating an imaginary world as powerful or intimate as that of any other artist.
  The passage does not discuss the superiority of one art form over another, nor does it explicitly mention the failure of works created for commercial success.
  Therefore, the answer is A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between painting and perfumery.
  Painters utilize oils and resins, while perfumers use natural and synthetic chemical compounds.
  Both create symphonic combinations of various elements.
  Both create sensations that changes and develop over time.
  Both aim to create an illusion that evokes memories.
  There is no indication in the passage about one form of art being superior to others.
  The answer is therefore E: Some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the relation between painting and perfume making, and emphasizes the similarity between them.
  Both of them use carefully formulated natural and synthetic chemical compounds to achieve certain aesthetic effects by evoking sensations like color and smell.
  By calling on our capacity to discover memory, which can be associated with childhood or long-forgotten experiences, they can create an aesthetic experience.
  The passage argues that the fine perfume is not well-served by marketing and public relations because it is now entangled with the international cosmetic dollar.
  There is no mention of one art form being superior to others, works of art improving with age, or commercial success leading inevitably to failure.
  As the passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through memory, Choice A is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the similarities between painting and perfume-making as they both are creative arts that involve combining different elements to create an aesthetic experience.
  The author mentions that perfumes are often undervalued due to the involvement of large corporations manufacturing them that substitute old formulas with cheaper ingredients to increase profit.
  The author does not make any suggestions about one form of art being superior to the other.
  The author rather discusses the reasons behind why great perfumes are not taken seriously.
  Therefore, the passage does not provide any support for statement A, statement C, statement D, and statement E.
  However, statement B is supported by the passage. The passage mentions that perfume-makers experiment with configurations of olfactory elements and produce many small sensations in symphonic combination, at times discordant, sweet, bitter, melancholy, or happy. This is similar to painting, where the layers of oil paint are carefully applied across the color spectrum, slowly building up to the surface, completing their work with thin glazes on top.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage compares the art of painting to that of perfumery.
  Painters create illusion on canvas using pigments and oils while perfumer uses natural and synthetic chemical compounds.
  A painting changes over time as oil paint becomes more transparent, while a perfume changes as its constituents evaporate at different rates.
  The combination of colors can evoke memories and emotions in a painting, while the combination of scents can also evoke memories and emotions in a perfume.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for A: A work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the parallels between different art forms, specifically between oil painting and perfume.
  It highlights the complex process involved in creating both.
  The passage notes that great perfumes are not taken seriously enough by the art world.
  It also explains that perfumes are often devalued because they are made and distributed by large corporations that use cheaper, synthetic chemicals.
  The passage supports the idea that a work of art can bring about an aesthetic experience through the memories that it evokes and the small sensations it creates, as seen in painting and perfume.
  The passage does not suggest that a work of art will inevitably fail if created for commercial success or that some forms of art are superior to others.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two forms of art: painting and perfume, and compares the two ranging from their creative processes to their impact on our senses.
  The author points out that a talented perfumer has the capacity to create an imaginary world that can be as powerful and intimate as that created by a great composer or painter.
  In addition, the author mentions that perfumes made by large corporations today are not necessarily based on precise formulas. They use cheap chemicals to create synthetic versions of rarer, better ingredients.
  Hence, the passage does not provide support for choice D and choice E.
  The passage discusses how art can evoke memories and sensations, this supports choice A.
  The passage's discussion of how "talented 'noses' experiment with complex configurations of olfactory elements and produce in symphonic combination many small sensations" support choice B.
  The passage does not mention or imply that for a work of art to be successful it must not be created for the sake of commercial success, therefore, this rules out choice C.

Topic: Law
Context: "Stealing thunder" is a courtroom strategy that consists in a lawyer's revealing negative information about a client before that information is revealed or elicited by an opposing lawyer. While there is no point in revealing a weakness that is unknown to one's opponents or that would not be exploited by them, many lawyers believe that if the weakness is likely to be revealed in opposing testimony, it should be volunteered; otherwise, the hostile revelation would be more damaging.Although no empirical research has directly tested the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is, in fact, effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. Lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is not only corroborated by those experimental findings; it is also supported by several psychological explanations of why the technique should work. For one thing, volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility. Psychological research suggests that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive. Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present. In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning. Also, the value placed on a persuasive message is probably much like the value placed on any commodity; the scarcer the commodity, the more valuable it is. A persuasive message will thus increase in value and effectiveness to the extent that it is seen as scarce. In the courtroom, a piece of evidence brought by both the prosecution and the defense, as when thunder is stolen, may be seen as less scarce becoming "old news." Thus, unless that evidence is of overriding consequence, it should carry less weight than if it had been included only in hostile testimony.Finally, stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance, just as politicians sometimes seek to put their "spin" on potentially damaging information. However, it may therefore be effective only when the negative information can be framed positively. Jurors, who often initially have little information about a case, are usually eager to solidify their position regarding the case. They can therefore be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their subsequent analysis of the trial information. But this also suggests limitations on the use of the technique: when information is very damaging, stealing thunder may create an early negative impression that forms a cognitive framework for jurors, who then filter subsequent information through this schema.
Question: Which one of the following does the author mention as a factor that in some instances probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder?
Choices:
  A: careful timing of the thunder-stealing message to precede the opposition's similar message by only a short time
  B: some lawyers' superior skill in assessing jurors' probable reactions to a message
  C: the willingness of some lawyers' clients to testify in person about their own past mistakes
  D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing
  E: lawyers' careful screening of prospective jurors prior to the beginning of courtroom proceedings
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks about a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage lists several psychological explanations as to why stealing thunder should work.
  One of the factors may be that volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility.
  The passage explains that people who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and therefore may be more persuasive.
  The author cites psychological research that suggests that audiences warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt.
  This suggests that if the negative information is presented early and honestly, the jury may be more receptive to defense arguments against it later in the trial.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks the factor which contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The article states multiple psychological explanations of why this technique should work.
  Some of these factors include creating an image of credibility and providing an impetus for critical assessment.
  Also, early framing of negative information can guide jurors' subsequent analysis as well as increase the perceived value of a persuasive message.
  Based on these factors, the most likely answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The question asks which factor contributes to the success of stealing thunder.

  One factor that directly addresses the success of stealing thunder is that it may create an image of credibility.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
The passage mentions several factors supporting the effectiveness of stealing thunder.
One of them is that volunteering negative information early may create an image of credibility, which is more likely to persuade people. Another factor is that stealing thunder may provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing testimony. The passage also suggests that stealing thunder works better when the information can be framed positively.
None of the answers mentioned seem to match these factors.
Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The question is asking for a factor that probably contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
  The passage mentions several psychological explanations for why it may work, but no specific factor.
  None of the answer choices mention any of the psychological explanations that the passage discussed.
  However, the passage suggests that jurors are eager to form a position about the case and stealing thunder can provide them with a cognitive framework for filtering subsequent information.
  Therefore, 'D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing' may be a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author mentions several factors that may contribute to the success of stealing thunder:
    -volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility.
    -Stealing thunder may also provide juries with an impetus for critical assessment by previewing, and thus alerting them to, testimony that the opposition plans to present.
    -In psychological experiments, audiences that were previously warned of an upcoming attempt at persuasion became more resistant to the persuasive attempt, forming counterarguments based on the warning.
    -Stealing thunder may work because the lawyer can frame the evidence in his or her own terms and downplay its significance.
  None of these choices are exactly the same, but the author does mention jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing. Therefore, the closest answer to this question is D.

Among all the choices, only the statement "D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing" aligns with the above understanding in terms of the role of jurors in stealing thunder. Hence, D is the right answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses several factors that likely contribute to the success of stealing thunder as a courtroom strategy.
  One factor discussed is that, by volunteering damaging information early, an attorney may create an image of credibility, which can make them more persuasive.
  Another factor is that, by previewing opposing testimony for the jury, the attorney can help the jury critically assess the evidence, and jurors who are more critically engaged are less easily persuaded.
  The passage also suggests that the technique works better when the negative information can be framed positively, which involves an element of spin.
  There is no mention of timing, legal assessment of juror reactions, client testimony, or juror screening.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:

  The passage mentions several psychological explanations for why stealing thunder may work.
  One of those explanations is that volunteering damaging information early may create an image of credibility.
  People who reveal information that appears to be against their own best interest are likely to be perceived as more credible and thus may be more persuasive.
  This suggests that jurors are more likely to believe an attorney who voluntarily reveals negative information about their own client before the opposing side communicates it.
  Therefore, the answer is D: jurors' desire to arrive at a firm view regarding the case they are hearing.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage suggests that there are psychological explanations of why stealing thunder could be effective.
  It is stated that stealing thunder could create an image of credibility.

Topic: Law
Context: Music and literature, rivals among the arts, have not coexisted without intruding on each other's terrain. Ever since what we think of as "literature" developed out of the sounds of spoken, sung, and chanted art, writing bas aspired to the condition of music, in which fonn contnbutes significantly to content. Nowhere is this truer than in the African American tradition, whose music is often considered its greatest artistic achievement and one of the greatest contributions to North American art. But while many African American writers have used musicians and music as theme and metaphor in their writing, none had attempted to draw upon a musical genre as the structuring principle for an entire novel until Toni Morrison did so in her 1992 novel Jazz, a novel set in the Harlem section of New York City in 1926 . In Jazz, the connection to music is found not only in the novel's plot but, more strikingly, in the way in which the story is told. The narration slips easily from the third-person omniscience of the narrator's disembodied voice-which, though sensitive and sympathetic, claims no particular identity, gender, or immersion in specific social circumstances-to the first-person lyricism of key characters. But throughout these shifts, the narrator is both generous with the characters' voices and protective of his or her mastery over the narrative as a whole. On the one hand, the central characters are given the responsibility of relating their parts of the overarching story, but on the other hand, their sections are set offby quotation maIks, reminders that the narrator is allowing them to speak.. In this way, the narrative is analogous in structure to the playing of a jazz hand which intertwines its ensemble sound with the individuality of emhedded solo perfunnances. In jazz, composer and conductor Duke Ellington was the first to construct his compositions with his individual musicians and their unique "voices" in mind. Yet no matter how lengthy his musicians' improvisations, no matter how bold or inventive their solos might be, they always performed within the undeniable logic of the composer's frame-they always, in other words, performed as ifwith quotation marks ar01md their improvisations and solos. It is this same effect that Toni Morrison has achieved in Jazz, a literary rendering of an art of composition that Duke Ellington perfected around the time in which Jazz is set. In this novel, Morrison has found a way, paradoxically, to create the sense of an ensemble of characters improvising within the fixed scope of a carefully constructed collective narration. By simulating the style of a genius of music while exhibiting Morrison's own linguistic virtuosity, Jazz serves to redefine the very possibilities of narrative point of view.
Question: The information in the passage most supports which one of the following statements regarding Ellington?
Choices:
  A: Morrison has explicitly credited him with inspiring the style of narration that she developed in Jazz.
  B: He prevented his musicians from perfonuing lengthy solos in order to preserve the unity of his compositions.
  C: He is a minor character in Morrison's Jazz.
  D: He composed music that was originally intended to be performed by the specific musicians he condueted.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Although most organisms are known to produce several kinds of proteins, the mechanism by which isolated protein molecules such as prions reproduce themselves is not yet known in detail.
  B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
  C: Recent research suggests that prions may be responsible not only for CJD, but for most other degenerative neurological conditions as well.
  D: The assertion that prions cause CJD has been received with great skepticism in the scientific community because it undermines a firmly entrenched view about the nature of pathogens.
  E: Even though prions contain no genetic material, it has become clear that they are somehow capable of reproducing themselves.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about an infection caused by a pathogen called a prion, that lacks genetic material.
  Prions are capable of reproducing themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to convert into an abnormal, pathogenic shape.
  This cascade process produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that disrupts the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  The mechanism by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood
  The answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the discovery of a new class of protein pathogen called prions that cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD).
  Prions are different from other agents known to cause infections because they lack genetic material. They are proteins that can convert otherwise harmless proteins into ones that cause cell destruction in chain reactions, causing serious and fatal diseases.
  The passage briefly mentions that prions might also be involved in other neurological diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but this possibility has yet to be fully explored.
  The main point of the passage is about prions and how they are different from other types of infectious pathogens, causing fatal diseases via unique mechanisms.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Research into the cause of CJD has uncovered a deadly class of protein pathogens uniquely capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material. 
Action: Answer("B")

  Prions reproduce themselves by converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape (initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform) instead of genetic material.
  Prions cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which is inevitably fatal.
  The discovery of prions and their link to CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community but is now supported with subsequent research.
  The mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves is still not fully understood.
  Therefore, B is the most accurate choice as it summarizes the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage talks about the discovery of prions and their relation to CJD.

Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage describes:
  - how infections occur
  - the background and discovery of prions
  - CJD symptoms and consequences
  - possible links between prions and other degenerative neurological diseases
  The main idea of the passage should address this broader context.
  
  A: Although it is mentioned that not all mechanisms regarding protein production and reproduction are completely understood and that prions are a new class of infectious pathogens, this does not accurately reflect the main point of the passage. Therefore, A is incorrect.
  B: This accurately reflects the main point of the passage. The passage describes the background and discovery of prions, which scientists isolated as a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein that has the ability to reproduce itself in a unique way, initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into a dangerous abnormal shape. They're believed to be the first proteinaceous infectious agent. In addition, it also explains how CJD is the first identified disease linked to prions.
  C: This option is not mentioned in the passage as there is not enough research to make such claims regarding other diseases. Therefore, C is incorrect.
  D: This option is incorrect since the passage does not address the skepticism of the scientific community as being the main point.
  E: The possibility of prions being capable of reproducing themselves is mentioned, but it is not the main idea of the passage. The development surrounding prions and their relation to CJD is the main idea.
Therefore, B accurately reflects the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a new type of infection agent called a prion, which lacks nucleic acid and is mainly composed of protein.
  Prions have the ability to convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproduce themselves.

Topic: Law
Context: There are some basic conceptual problems hovering about the widespread use of brain scans as pictures of mental activity. As applied to medical diagnosis (for example, in diagnosing a brain tumor), a brain scan is similar in principle to an X-ray: it is a way of seeing inside the body. Its value is straightforward and indubitable. However, the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise. It is a research method the validity of which depends on a premise: that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. This premise is known as the modular theory of mind. It may in fact be that neither mental activity, nor the physical processes that constitute it, are decomposable into independent modules. Psychologist William Uttal contends that rather than distinct entities, the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. It cannot be said, for instance, that the amygdala is the seat of emotion and the prefrontal cortex is the seat of reason, as the popular press sometimes claims. For when I get angry, I generally do so for a reason. To cleanly separate emotion from reason-giving makes a hash of human experience. But if this critique of the modular theory of mind is valid, how can one account for the fact that brain scans do, in fact, reveal well-defined areas that "light up," in response to various cognitive tasks? In the case of functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), what you are seeing when you look at a brain scan is actually the result of a subtraction. The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. One immediately obvious (but usually unremarked) problem is that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. A false impression of neat functional localization is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions. This subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. But isn't the modular theory of mind ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method?
Question: According to the passage, psychologist William Uttal contends that the various mental processes are likely to be
Choices:
  A: independent modules that are based in different areas of the brain
  B: essentially an amalgamation of emotion and reason
  C: generally uniform in their rates of oxygen use

Topic: Law
Context: Passage ATo a neuroscientist, you are your brain; nothing causes your behavior other than the operations of your brain. This viewpoint, together with recent findings in neuroscience, radically changes the way we think about the law. The official line in the law is that all that matters is whether you are rational, but you can have someone who is totally rational even though their strings are being pulled by something beyond their control. Indeed, people who believe themselves to be making a free and rational moral choice may really be deluding themselves—a brain scan might show that such a choice correlates with activity in emotional centers in the brain rather than in the region of the brain associated with deliberative problem solving. This insight suggests that the criminal-justice system should abandon the idea of retribution—the idea that bad people should be punished because of their freely chosen immoral acts—which is now dominant as a justification of punishment. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms. In some cases, this might mean lighter punishments. If it is really true that we do not get any prevention bang from our punishment buck when we punish some person, then it is not worth punishing that person. Passage B Neuroscience constantly produces new mechanistic descriptions of how the physical brain causes behavior, adding fuel to the deterministic view that all human action is causally necessitated by events that are independent of the will. It has long been argued, however, that the concept of free will can coexist with determinism.In 1954 English philosopher Alfred J. Ayer put forth a theory of "soft determinism." He argued, as the philosopher David Hume had two centuries earlier, that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely. Ayer distinguished between free actions and constrained actions. Free actions are those that are caused by internal sources, by one's own will (unless one is suffering from a disorder). Constrained actions are those that are caused by external sources, for example, by someone or something forcing you physically or mentally to perform an action, as in hypnosis or in mental disorders such as kleptomania. When someone performs a free action to do A, he or she could have done B instead, since no external source precluded doing so. When someone performs a constrained action to do A, he or she could have done only A.Ayer argued that actions are free as long as they are not constrained. It is not the existence of a cause but the source of the cause that determines whether an action is free. Although Ayer did not explicitly discuss the brain's role, one could make the analogy that those actions—and indeed those wills-that originate from a disease-free brain are not constrained, and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
Question: Which one of the following concepts plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A?
Choices:
  A: mental disorder
  B: free choice
  C: causality
  D: self-delusion
  E: moral responsibility
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that the traditional justification of punishment should be abandoned, and the law should instead focus on deterring future harms. 
  This argument is based on the viewpoint of neuroscientists that human behavior is entirely determined by the operations of the brain and that people may not be making free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B argues that even in a deterministic world, a person can still act freely, and actions are free as long as they are not constrained. The analogy is made that those actions originating from a disease-free brain are not constrained and are therefore free, even though they may be determined.
  The concept that plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in passage A is free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The argument in passage B deals with the extent of free will given determinism.
  Mental disorder is discussed in passage B, but it is not a part of Ayer's soft determinism.
  Passage A talks about self-delusion and moral responsibility in light of neuroscience findings, and how it might lead to a change in the focus of the criminal-justice system.
  Causality plays a role in both passages.
  Free choice is a key concept in both passages.
  The only concept that is mentioned in passage B but not in passage A is mental disorder, but it is not the main argument.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The argument of passage A focuses on the idea that behavior is caused by the operations of the brain and that people can be deluded into thinking they make free and rational choices.
  Passage B discusses the relationship between determinism and free will and distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Passage B discusses mental disorders such as kleptomania as examples of constrained actions, whereas Passage A does not.
  Therefore, the concept of mental disorder plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not in that of Passage A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that regardless of free choice, brain operations are the only means by which a person behaves.
  According to passage A, the criminal justice system should abandon the idea of retribution and focus on deterring future harm.
  Passage B suggests the theory of "soft determinism," which argues that a person can still act freely in a deterministic world.
  Passage B distinguishes between free and constrained actions based on the source of the cause, and actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  Therefore, the concept that plays a role in the argument of Passage B but not Passage A is free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that free choice and moral responsibility should not be the dominant reasons for punishment in the criminal-justice system. Instead, the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues that free will can coexist with determinism. Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" distinguishes between free actions and constrained actions. 
  Passage B does not mention self-delusion, but rather discusses the distinction between free actions and constrained actions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues for abandoning retribution and focusing on deterring future harms.
  This argument is linked to the view that brain operations are what cause behavior, independent of free and rational moral choices.
  Passage B examines the concept of free will or free actions, arguing that free will can coexist with determinism.
  The argument rests on the distinction between free and constrained actions.
  The distinction is based on the source of the cause of an action, rather than the existence of a cause itself.
  Passage B does not discuss self-delusion, mental disorders and moral responsibility in detail, but it does discuss the concept of free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A: The author argues that the criminal justice system should focus on deterrence and abandon retribution based punishment. 
  Passage B: The author argues that free will can coexist with determinism; actions are free as long as they are not constrained.
  The difference I notice is that Passage A talks about abandoning retribution-based punishment, whereas Passage B talks about free will coexisting with determinism.
  Therefore, the answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the view that people act freely and make their own choices may not be accurate, because their behavior is caused by their brain.
  Passage A suggests that the focus of the law should be on deterring future harms, rather than retribution.
  Passage B argues that even in a deterministic world, people can still act freely.
  Passage B proposes the concept of "soft determinism" that distinguishes between free and constrained actions.
  Passage B does not mention self-delusion from the given options.
  Passage B does mention free choice as the concept of "soft determinism."
  Passage B does not mention moral responsibility, as it is related to retribution, which is not the focus of Passage B.
  Passage B mentions mental disorder as an example of constrained actions.
  Passage B also mentions the role of causality in determining whether an action is free.
  Therefore, the answer is A: mental disorder.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that our behavior is caused by the operations of our brain and that the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B presents Ayer's theory of "soft determinism" that argues free actions are caused by internal sources, and constrained actions are caused by external sources.
  Therefore, free choice, which is presented in passage B's argument, plays a role in the argument of passage B but not in that of passage A.
  The answer is B: free choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that free and rational moral choices might be delusive since they are interconnected with emotional centers in the brain.
  Passage A suggests that instead of retribution, the law should focus on deterring future harms.
  Passage B argues for the existence of free will in deterministic world.
  Passage B differentiates between free actions and constrained actions based on the source of the cause.
  Passage B argues that if actions can be traced back to a disease-free brain, they are free.
  Mental disorder, self-delusion, and moral responsibility are concepts in both passages.
  Causality is present in both passages, but it plays a more significant role in Passage B.
  The concept that plays a role only in Passage B is free choice.

Topic: Law
Context: Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial bypothesis was long overlooked. A case in point is the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split Between 1934, when a group ofitalian physicists including Enrico Fermi first bombarded uranium with neutrons, and 1939, when exiled Austrian physicist Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.Earlier, even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated, sometheoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart. But the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. A common view was that a neutron's breaking apart a uranium nucleus would be analogous to a pebble, thrown through a window, causing a house to collapse.In Berlin, Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. Fermi and others achieved numerous similar results. These products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, but more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition. In 1938 Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation. Late in that year he wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element whose structure would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments. Hahn even remarked that, despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occmred, it went "against all previous experiences of nuclear physics," but be also noted that together the number of protons and neutrons in the nuclei of barium and technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, added up to the number of such particles that compose a uranium nucleus.It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms. Coining the term "nuclear fission," she quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch. When scientists in Europe and North America rushed to corroborate the findings, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some rime, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage talks about the development of nuclear fission.
  The physics community did not recognize the discovery of nuclear fission in the early stage.
  Theoretical physicists could produce calculations indicating that atoms could be split but experimental physicists were not receptive to that.
  They expected that all the results from neutron bombardment of uranium would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  The physicist Lise Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and she coined the term "nuclear fission".
  Based on the above facts, it can be concluded that the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage mentions the discovery of a means by which the nuclei of atoms can be split from 1934 to 1939.
  At that time, scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Some theoretical physicists had earlier produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving nuclear fission, which made researchers not receptive to it.
  The researchers did not identify some radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
  The ignorance about the by-products was due to their expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection for the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The physics community lacks the right conceptual link, which prevents the recognition of the relevant evidence.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  In the passage, the author describes how the nuclear fission of uranium atoms was discovered and recognized by the physics community.
  The passage does not suggest that the physics community neglected earlier theoretical developments, reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split, showed that uranium atoms were the easiest to split, or recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances. 
  The passage actually implies that the physicists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but without recognizing what they were witnessing. This answer is closest to B: It reevaluated calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  During the 1930s, the physics community compiled increasing evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists produced calculations of breaking apart atoms.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at splitting atoms, therefore researchers were not receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The researchers neglected to recognize the results of the experiments due to their expectation that all products would be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, which would have made it impossible to produce through any mechanism involved in the experiments.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations, and coined the term "nuclear fission."
  Based on these, we can conclude that the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage describes how the physicists in the 1930s did not recognize the possibility of splitting atoms through neutron bombardment experiments.
  The passage also describes that some earlier theoretical physicists had worked on calculations indicating that atoms could be split.
  The passage has no discussion on the neglect of earlier theoretical developments. Hence option A is eliminated.
  The passage states that scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing, indicating that the physics community did not reevaluate calculations indicating that atoms could be split. Hence option B is eliminated.
  The passage describes how the researchers produced a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium, and the products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials. Hence, the physics community recognized the dangers of working with radioactive substances. Option E is eliminated.
  The passage has a separate discussion on Uranium, which was the primary and complicated element to split into two during the 1930s. But, it does not refer to Uranium as being the easiest element to split. Hence, the option D is eliminated.
  The passage states that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms, and it was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations. Hence, the evidence regarding nuclear fission had been present for some time, but lacking mainly the right conceptual link. Therefore, the option C is also eliminated.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions how earlier theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that it should be possible to break atoms apart in principle.
  However, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Therefore, the community was not even receptive to the possibility of splitting uranium atoms this way in that context.
  Researchers compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were seeing until Meitner made the crucial theoretical connection.
  After Meitner gave her conclusion for publication in a paper co-authored with Frisch, scientists rushed to corroborate the findings which showed that the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  Therefore, the correct answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how the physics community did not initially recognize the significance of the data that showed atoms could be split. 
  While some theoretical physicists had produced calculations before the discovery, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not meant to achieve the splitting of atoms.
  Scientists were initially not receptive to the possibility of nuclear fission even when there was increasing evidence that it had been achieved. 
  The discovery of nuclear fission was aided by the theoretical connection provided by Lise Meitner after her research related to that of the Italians.
  Despite the clear chemical evidence of what had occurred, it went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data.
  Therefore, none of the choices describe the physics community during the 1930s accurately.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The discovery of nuclear fission was not immediately recognized by the physics community.
  The physics community collected evidence of nuclear fission without recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Lise Meitner was the physicist who provided the crucial theoretical connection.
  Otto Hahn, Meitner's research partner kept her informed of his continuing experimentation.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the physics community neglected important theoretical developments, such as the possibility of breaking atoms apart, until Meitner made the connection.
  The answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage explains that theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart even before the neutron and proton composition of atomic nuclei had been experimentally demonstrated. However, the neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context. Therefore, the community probably neglected earlier theoretical developments and was not looking for nuclear fission in particular.
  The rest of the choices are not mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
The passage describes the history of the discovery of nuclear fission.
At first, scientists did not recognize that they were splitting uranium atoms.
However, Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection in 1939.
Therefore, it can be inferred that prior to Meitner's discovery in 1939, the physics community had not yet recognized that they were splitting uranium atoms.
This makes option A incorrect because the physics community did not neglect earlier theoretical developments.
This also makes B and D incorrect because there is no indication in the passage that the physics community reevaluated calculations or showed that uranium atoms were easiest to split.
Option E is also incorrect because the passage only mentions that the dangers of working with radioactive substances hampered precise chemical analyses, but does not indicate that the community recognized these dangers.
The passage does mention that the products of the neutron bombardment of uranium remained unidentified, partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered, and more significantly because of the expectation that they would all be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
However, this is not the same as saying that the physics community never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.
Therefore, the correct answer is C: It never identified the by-products of neutron bombardment of uranium.

Response 0:
Thought:
The author mentions that relevant evidence has been present for some time but was lacking the right conceptual link.
The evidence described is what Meitner and Hahn found about the element Barium, indicating that the atom had been split.
Therefore, the answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses events leading up to the discovery of nuclear fission (the splitting of uranium atoms) in the late 1930s.
  The passage states that the relevant evidence had been present for some time but lacked the right conceptual link.
  The relevant data most likely refers to the evidence for nuclear fission being achieved.
  According to the passage, a crucial theoretical connection leading to this discovery was made by Lise Meitner in 1939. 
  The clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium was a significant part of the discovery, but it alone does not represent "the relevant evidence" that had been present for some time.
  The evidence for nuclear fission being achieved was present in the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  "The relevant evidence" must pertain to the experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium.
  According to the passage, the relevant evidence was present for some time.
  From the passage, there were related experiments conducted by Meitner and by others that provided increasing evidence.
  However, it was Lise Meitner who made the crucial theoretical connection that the scientists had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
  The relevant evidence that was present for some time, therefore, was the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium conducted by the physics community between 1934 and 1939, including the discovery of barium.
  C correctly identifies the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium but does not account for all of the relevant evidence mentioned in the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author refers to the "relevant evidence" (line 62) as something that had been present for some time but lacked mainly the right conceptual link.
  The evidence here refers to a specific data that led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  The author previously mentioned Lise Meitner's research findings, which eventually led to the discovery.
  Therefore, the evidence in this context is the fact that uranium atoms were being split through the neutron bombardment experiments.
  Option A and B are too broad and do not correctly describe the specific evidence.
  Option C is the evidence that was puzzling until Lise Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, but this evidence alone was not sufficient for the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Option D is only part of the evidence that eventually led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Option E is not a specific evidence that helped to discover nuclear fission. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author discusses the evidence that lead to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Initially, scientists amassed increasing evidence that they could not recognize.
  Lise Meitner recognized that researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  When scientists rushed to corroborate Meitner's findings, they realized the relevant evidence had been present for some time, lacking mainly the right conceptual link.
  The phrase "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery.
  The answer is not A. Although evidence from neutron bombardment of uranium was compiled and contributed to discovering nuclear fission, the phrase "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery.
  The answer is not B. Meitner's research in 1938 contributed to the discovery of nuclear fission. Still, the phrase "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery.
  The answer is C. Hahn's discovery that one of the substances resulting from neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium provided clear chemical evidence that went against all previous experiences of nuclear physics. However, this is not the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery; this is the evidence that helped Meitner to recognize that the researchers had been splitting uranium atoms.
  The answer is D. Technetium, the accompanying product of the experiment, and barium together have the number of protons and neutrons that compose a uranium nucleus. Although this fact confirms Meitner's discovery that researchers had been splitting uranium atoms, this is not the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery.
  The answer is E. The term "the relevant evidence" refers to the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery. The fact that radioactive products of neutron bombardment of uranium went unidentified for so long is the evidence that had been present for some time but unrecognized until Meitner's discovery.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
The "relevant evidence" can be inferred by understanding what Meitner recognized as significant in relation to the underlying theoretical considerations. 
The author mentions the discovery of a puzzling group of radioactive substances that remained unidentified.
Meitner's research partner, Otto Hahn, identified that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium, an element that could not have been produced through any mechanism he envisaged as being involved in the experiments.
These pieces of information led Meitner to conclude that the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.
Therefore, the "relevant evidence" refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  "the relevant evidence" led to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection after receiving a letter late in 1938 that one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
  Meitner recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and quickly submitted her conclusion for publication in a paper coauthored with pbysicist Otto Frisch.
  This led many scientists in Europe and North America to corroborate their findings.
  Therefore, "the relevant evidence" mentioned in the passage refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  The relevant evidence had been present for some time but it lacked the right conceptual link.
  The author mentions that Meitner recognized the significance of the data.
  The author discusses Hahn's discovery of a surprising result which Meitner related to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Hahn's discovery of the element barium being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium is important.
  Therefore, the relevant evidence in this passage refers to the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The answer is C: the clear chemical evidence that Hahn had found of barium's being produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
The paragraph talks about a discovery, nuclear fission.
Lise Meitner came up with nuclear fission by actually collaborating and analyzing other researcher's results.
Therefore, "the relevant evidence" refers to "the results of experiments in neutron bombardment of uranium", which were obtained from various researchers.
Option A makes the most sense and is the closest to inferential meaning.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The relevant evidence (line 62) means the data or information that supported the conclusion of nuclear fission.
  Nuclear fission was discovered by splitting uranium atoms using neutron bombardment.
  Lise Meitner was the one who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to the underlying theoretical considerations, which means she discovered the nuclear fission.
  The answer should relate to the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Option A talks about all the experiments conducted by physics community including the discovery of nuclear fission, but this option is too broad.
  Option B talks about related experiments conducted by Meitner. This context doesn't require or focus on her side experiments.
  Option C is the observation made by Hahn, which is related to the discovery of nuclear fission but this option requires further analysis or deductions based on the evidence.
  Option D is the observation made by Hahn, which provided supporting facts for the discovery of nuclear fission. But this option also requires additional facts or information to be equivalent to the relevant evidence.

### Model: gpt-35-turbo | Agent: chain_of_thought | Exam: lsat-rc-100 | Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The painter Roy Lichtenstein helped to define pop art—the movement that incorporated commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques into paintings— by paraphrasing the style of comic books in his work. His merger of a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generated a complex result: while poking fun at the pretensions of the art world, Lichtenstein's work also managed to convey a seriousness of theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody. That Lichtenstein's images were fine art was at first difficult to see, because, with their word balloons and highly stylized figures, they looked like nothing more than the comic book panels from which they were copied. Standard art history holds that pop art emerged as an impersonal alternative to the histrionics of abstract expressionism, a movement in which painters conveyed their private attitudes and emotions using nonrepresentational techniques. The truth is that by the time pop art first appeared in the early 1960s, abstract expressionism had already lost much of its force. Pop art painters weren't quarreling with the powerful early abstract expressionist work of the late 1940s but with a second generation of abstract expressionists whose work seemed airy, high-minded, and overly lyrical. Pop art paintings were full of simple black lines and large areas of primary color. Lichtenstein's work was part of a general rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism, rather than an aloof attempt to ignore it. But if rebellion against previous art by means of the careful imitation of a popular genre were all that characterized Lichtenstein's work, it would possess only the reflective power that parodies have in relation to their subjects. Beneath its cartoonish methods, his work displayed an impulse toward realism, an urge to say that what was missing from contemporary painting was the depiction of contemporary life. The stilted romances and war stories portrayed in the comic books on which he based his canvases, the stylized automobiles, hot dogs, and table lamps that appeared in his pictures, were reflections of the culture Lichtenstein inhabited. But, in contrast to some pop art, Lichtenstein's work exuded not a jaded cynicism about consumer culture, but a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed not only in the later abstract expressionists but in some other pop artists. With the comics— typically the domain of youth and innocence—as his reference point, a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them, for all their surface bravado, an inner sweetness. His persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling.
Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
Choices:
  A: Lichtenstein frequently attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  B: Lichtenstein praised a contemporary abstract expressionist in the 1960s for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  C: Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  D: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings.
  E: Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes Lichtenstein's work as a blend of parody and a serious (yet naive) search for realism.
  The passage emphasizes that Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Choice (A) does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it simply states that Lichtenstein attended exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters in the 1960s.
  Choice (B) does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it simply states that Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist painter for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  Choice (C) does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it simply states that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  Choice (D) could contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein if he criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings since his own work is characterized as a rebellion against the excessive emotionalism of abstract expressionism.
  Choice (E) could contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein if he criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion since his own work is characterized as having an inner sweetness.
  Therefore, the answer is either (D) or (E).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who:
  - helped to define pop art using commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques in paintings
  - merged a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generating a result that conveyed a seriousness of theme transcending mere parody
  - rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism
  - had an impulse towards realism and depicted contemporary life
  - used comic-art conventions and a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them an inner sweetness
  
  The question asks which of the following would MOST challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein did the opposite of what the author characterizes him as doing, it could challenge the author's claims.
  However, none of the answer options contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer: None of the above.
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage explains that Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  It also explains that his work displayed an impulse toward realism, and a kind of deliberate naivete in contrast to some other pop artists' jaded cynicism about consumer culture.
  Thus, any option that contradicts these characterizations would challenge the author's portrayal of Lichtenstein.
  Option A is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's art style and therefore cannot challenge the author's view of him.
  Option B does not contradict the author's characterization, but it is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's art style.
  Option C could potentially challenge the author's characterization if Lichtenstein did praise early abstract expressionists but in the passage, he is only said to rebel against their fading emotional power.
  Option D contradicts the author's characterization as the passage indicates that Lichtenstein's work displayed true feeling.
  Option E also contradicts the author's characterization as the passage explains that Lichtenstein's works have an inner sweetness.
  Therefore, C cannot be completely ruled out, but D and E more convincingly contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre with fine art that conveys a seriousness of theme, exudes deliberate naivete and faith in reconciliation.
  Choice A is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's characterization as described in the passage.
  Choice B is somewhat irrelevant to Lichtenstein's characterization as described in the passage. Praising a contemporary abstract expressionist for producing an atypically emotional painting does not necessarily contradict Lichtenstein's characteristics as described in the passage. 
  Choice C is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's characterization as described in the passage.
  Choice D is partially relevant but it does not directly challenge Lichtenstein's characterization as described in the passage. 
  Choice E is partially relevant but it actually supports Lichtenstein's characterization as described in the passage.
  Thus, None of the given choices can directly challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a merger of popular genre and fine art with a testament to realism.
  Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Lichtenstein's work shows a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication in some other pop artists.
  The question asks which of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice A is irrelevant as attending abstract expressionist exhibitions does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice B is not correct, as it is difficult to interpret as challenging the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice C is not correct, because praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice D is not correct as criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings does not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice E is the correct answer as if Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion, it would directly contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein's work as a testament of realism and the deliberate naivete in response to the excess of sophistication.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a combination of fine art and popular culture that conveyed both parody and real meaning.
  The author argues that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism and seeking to depict contemporary life through his work.
  To challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein, the answer would have to contradict one of these points.
  Option A is not a direct challenge to the author's characterization, as attending exhibitions does not necessarily imply agreement with the style.
  Option B challenges the characterization that Lichtenstein was rebelling against the emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  Option C is not a direct challenge to the author's characterization, as praising early abstract expressionist painters does not necessarily contradict Lichtenstein's rebellion against the fading emotional power of the second generation of abstract expressionist painters.
  Option D is not a direct challenge to the author's characterization, as criticizing another artist's work does not necessarily contradict Lichtenstein's own work or intentions.
  Option E challenges the characterization that Lichtenstein's work was deliberately naïve and not cynical about consumer culture.
  Therefore, the best answer would be E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work as a complex merger between fine art and popular comic book genre that possesses an urge towards realism. Lichtenstein's work also exhibits a nostalgia-filled inner sweetness, deliberate naivete, and faith in reconciliation.
Option A doesn't offer any contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Option B doesn't offer any contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Option C doesn't offer any contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Option D doesn't offer any contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
Option E, however, offers a contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein because Lichtenstein believed that pop art should have a balance between emotional power and a careful imitation of popular genres. Therefore, if Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion, it would contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein. 
Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein's work.
  The author believes that Lichtenstein's work includes fine art and a serious meaning.
  The author mentions that Lichtenstein's work wasn't just a rebellion against previous art.
  The author also mentions the deliberate naivete of Lichtenstein's work.
  If one choice were true, it would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Choice A does not challenge Lichtenstein's characterization.
  Choice B does not challenge Lichtenstein's characterization.
  Choice C does not challenge the characterization either.
  Choice D challenges some pop artist, not Lichtenstein.
  The deliberate naivete in Lichtenstein's work is about a response to the sophistication.
  If Lichtenstein criticized another pop artist in the 1960s for producing superficial work, it would, to some extent, challenge the author's characterization.
  Choice E states that Lichtenstein criticized another pop artist for producing paintings void of emotion.
  This choice is the most challenging to the author's characterization.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage characterizes Lichtenstein as someone who merged popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art to portray contemporary life.
  The passage also describes his persistent use of comic-art conventions demonstrates a faith in reconciliation, not only between cartoons and fine art, but between parody and true feeling. 
  The correct answer would present a fact that contradicts one or both of these characterizations.
  A: Attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters does not necessarily contradict the author's characterizations of Lichtenstein.
  B: This answer choice presents no contradiction to the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  C: Praising an early abstract painter for producing emotional painting also does not contradict the author's description of Lichtenstein.
  D: This answer choice does not contradict the author's characterizations of Lichtenstein.
  E: If Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist for producing paintings without emotion, then it contradicts the author's characterization of Lichtenstein since the passage describes that his paintings exuded a kind of deliberate naivete, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as merging the style of comic books with fine art, and conveying a serious theme that enabled it to transcend mere parody.
  Lichtenstein's work displayed an impulse toward realism and exuded a kind of deliberate naiveté, intended as a response to the excess of sophistication he observed.
  The question asks which one of the following, if true, would most challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein?
  Answer choice A about Lichtenstein attending exhibitions by abstract expressionist painters would not challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  Answer choice B is about a contemporary emotional painting produced by an abstract expressionist that Lichtenstein praised, which is out of scope.
  Answer choice C is about Lichtenstein praising an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings, which is out of scope. 
  Answer choice D about Lichtenstein criticizing a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings, is out of scope.
  Answer choice E that Lichtenstein criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion may challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.

Topic: Law
Context: Before contact with Europeans, the Haudenosaune, a group of nations in northeastern North America also known as the Iroquois, had been developing a form of communication, primarily for political purposes, that used wampum, a bead carved from seashell. Most historians have insisted that wampum was primarily a form of money. While wampum certainly did become a medium of exchange among Europeans and Haudenosaune alike, this was due to the Europeans, who misinterpreted the significance of wampum and used it solely to purchase goods from the Haudenosaune. However, the true significance of wampum for the Haudenosaune lies in its gradual development from objects with religious significance into a method for maintaining permanent peace among distinct nations. Over time wampum came to be used to record and convey key sociopolitical messages. Wampum came in two colors, white and deep purple. Loose beads constituted the simplest and oldest form of wampum. Even in the form of loose beads, wampum could represent certain basic ideas. For example, white was associated with the sky-yearning spirit, Sapling, whose terrestrial creations, such as trees, were often beneficial to humanity; deep purple was associated with Sapling's twin brother, Flint, the earth-loving spirit whose frequent mischievous vandalism (e.g., in the form of storms) often severely disrupted human life. Legend indicates, for example, that ancient Haudenosaune anglers threw the beads into the water in which they fished to communicate with Sapling or Flint (differing versions of the Haudenosaune cosmology attribute the creation of fish to one or the other of these spirits). Later, loose beads were strung together forming string wampum. It is thought that string wampum was used to send simple political messages such as truce requests. It was, however, the formation of the Haudenosaune Confederacy from a group of warring tribes, believed by some to have occurred around 1451, that supplied the major impetus for making wampum a deliberate system of both arbitrary and pictorially derived symbols designed primarily for political purposes. This is evident in the invention of wampum belts to encode the provisions of the Haudenosaune Confederacy's constitution. These belts combined string wampum to form icons that could be deciphered by those knowing the significance of the stylized symbols. For example, longhouses, depicted in front-view outline, usually meant a particular nation of the confederacy. Council fires, possibly indicating talks in progress, were diamond outlines that could appear alone or within trees or longhouses. Lines between humanlike figures seem to have indicated the current state of relations between peoples; belts containing such images were often used as safe-conduct passes. The arrangements of the two colors also directed interpretation of the symbols. Thus, the belts served to record, store, and make publicly available items of governmental business. Although the wampum symbol system had a limited lexicon, it served to effectively frame and enforce the law of the confederacy for hundreds of years.
Question: The last paragraph of the passage serves primarily to
Choices:
  A: detail how wampum belts evolved from other forms of wampum
  B: distinguish between wampum belts and less complex forms of string wampum
  C: illustrate how wampum functioned as a system of symbolic representation

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: Which one of the following laws would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B?
Choices:
  A: a law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone
  B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company
  C: a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market
  D: a law that legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising
  E: a law that legalizes trading based on inside information, as long as that information is not acquired by theft or other unlawful means
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that the stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to trade.
  The author of passage A argues that the insider-trading law should not criminalize selling based on information that a stock's price ought to be dropping or other similar actions.
  The author of passage B argues for the transparency principle of the stock market and says that the insider-trading unfairly compromises it.
  A law that permits trading that is based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that of passage B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues that insider trading laws should not prohibit stock transactions based on information one has that everyone else doesn't, and that such transactions are beneficial to the stock market.
  The author of passage B argues in favor of a transparent stock market where information influencing trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time.
  Of the options, A, B, and D include some degree of prohibition on inside trading.
  Option C calls for prohibiting trading that could undermine investor confidence, which is a potential consequence of insider trading, according to both passages, but is not directly advocated for by the author of passage A.
  Option E would legalize insider trading, which is neither advocated for by either passage nor generally accepted as legal.
  Therefore, the choice that would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A, but not that articulated by the author of passage B, would be B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The author of Passage A argues that insider-trading should be legal because it helps ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts, and insider trading is part of the very definition of a functioning stock market.
  The author of Passage B argues that insider-trading should be illegal because it unfairly compromises the market, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
  Therefore, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of Passage A but not that articulated by the author of Passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company. This law would allow people to profit from the unbiased and well-researched analysis of stocks, but would prevent people from trading using insider information, which gives them an unfair advantage over other investors, and could undermine the confidence of others in the stock market.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A supports people trading based on information that is not shared by everyone if it is gained from analysis of a stock.
  The author of passage A is against insider-trading which provides an unfair advantage to some people.
  The author of passage B supports transparency in the stock market where everyone has the same chance of making a good investment.
  The author of passage B believes that insider trading unfairly compromises the market.
  A law that prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone would oppose the position of passage A, which means A cannot be the answer. 
  A law permitting trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibiting trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company aligns with the position of passage A as it supports making informed trading decisions but limits insider trading. 
  A law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investor's confidence in the stock market could be a general statement, and it does not precisely align with any one author's position.
  A law that legalizes selling based on inside information could provide an advantage to some people that know more than others and goes against the principles of transparency, so this option cannot be correct. 
  A law that legalizes trading based on inside information without obtaining it by theft or other unlawful means would align with the position of passage A, but it disagrees with the position of passage B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that stock markets work based on gaining knowledge that others do not have and then using it to profit, and that widespread dissemination of accurate information is necessary for the stock market to function well.
  The author of Passage B believes in the importance of transparency in the stock market, information that influences trading decisions must be available to all participants at the same time, and insider trading unfairly compromises the market and undermines investor confidence, and it could ultimately destroy the market.
  Choice B seems to be the answer. It permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which aligns with the stance taken by author A.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. 
  Insiders who sell a stock because they know something will soon happen that will lower the stock's value help spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping, and that's good for everyone.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations compromise the market by giving some people access to information that other people don't have, which unfairly compromises the market.
  Since the question is asking for the one law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B, the answer must be a law that permits trading based on inside information.
  However, since passage A argues that insider-trading should not involve information that is not shared by everyone, the law must prohibit trading based on such information.
  The correct answer is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The author of passage A argues against insider-trading law.
  The author believes that insider-trading law undermines the functioning of a stock market.
  The author believes that stock markets rely on people gaining information that others don't have and then using it to profit.
  The author believes that the selling and purchasing of stocks based on information that is not shared by everyone is not a crime.
  The author believes that stock prices should reflect accurate information, and the actions of people who have accurate information should be permitted.
  The author believes that insider nontrading also occurs and should not be criminalized.
  The author of passage B believes in transparency and that everyone should have the same access to information that influences trading decisions.
  The author of passage B argues that insider-trading compromises the market and unfairly allows people to make informed trade decisions.
  The author of passage B believes that undermining investor confidence could ultimately destroy the market and cause financial repercussions.
  Based on this analysis, the law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B would be a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit the use of information that everyone else doesn't have as long as that information is gained from analysis of a stock. At the same time, it is argued that insider trading law should make illegal the use of information obtained from one's position within a company.
  Passage B, on the other hand, argues that the use of inside information of any kind, whether obtained from analysis of a stock or from one's position within a company, unfairly compromises the market.
  Among the choices, the law that would conform most closely to the position articulated in passage A but not in passage B is one that would permit trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibit trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Passage A supports the idea that trading based on information that not everyone has could benefit stock markets, especially if it spreads knowledge about relevant changing circumstances.
  Passage A does not support trading based on information that one obtains from their special position within a company.
  Passage A suggests that it is important that all the relevant information about a company be spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Passage B supports the idea that trading based on inside information could ultimately destroy the stock market. It undermines investor confidence, which is important to the growth and success of companies.
  The most suitable law for this position would be one that ensures investors' confidence in the stock market.
  Choice C outlines a law that prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The author of passage A argues in favor of allowing trading based on information that people don't share.
  However, this should be allowed only if the information is the result of analysis rather than the use of insider information.
  The author of passage B argues in favor of prohibiting insider trading because it is not fair and transparent, and it compromises the market.
  The option that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A is B: a law that permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company.
  This law would allow people to analyze stocks in order to make investment decisions, even if others don't have the same information.
  At the same time, it would prohibit the use of insider information that is not available to the general public, which would give some traders an unfair advantage over others.

Topic: Law
Context: Neurobiologists once believed that the workings of the brain were guided exclusively by electrical signals; according to this theory, communication between neurons (brain cells) is possible because electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses (gaps between neurons). But many neurobiologists puzzled over how this leaping across synapses might be achieved, and as early as 1904 some speculated that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically. According to this alternative theory, the excited neuron secretes a chemical called a neurotransmitter that binds with its corresponding receptor molecule in the receiving neuron. This binding of the neurotransmitter renders the neuron permeable to ions, and as the ions move into the receiving neuron they generate an electrical impulse that runs through the cell; the electrical impulse is thereby transmitted to the receiving neuron. This theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community, but for a long time little was known about the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions. In fact, some scientists remained skeptical of the theory because they had trouble imagining how the binding of a chemical to a receptor at the cell surface could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane. Recently, however, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity. The new evidence shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions; attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component. Several types of receptors have been isolated that conform to this structure, among them the receptors for acetylcholine, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glycine, and serotonin. These receptors display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. It has also been discovered that each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that, for example, a GABA receptor in one part of the brain has slightly different properties than a GABA receptor in another part of the brain. This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders. As the precise effect on behavior of every variety of each neurotransmitter-gated ion channel is deciphered, pharmacologists may be able to design drugs targeted to specific receptors on defined categories of neurons that will selectively impede or enhance these effects. Such drugs could potentially help ameliorate any number of debilitating conditions, including mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
Question: Which one of the following most completely and accurately states the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  B: Evidence shows that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  C: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that enough similarities exist among these chemicals to allow scientists to classify them as a family.
  D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  E: Evidence shows that receptor molecules in the brain differ subtly from one another, and that these differences can be exploited to treat certain brain disorders through the use of drugs that selectively affect particular parts of the brain.
Response 0:
Thought:
The passage discusses two theories of how neurons communicate (electrically and chemically).
One theory, which suggests that neurotransmitters transmit electrical impulses was doubted, but a new explanation proposes that structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in converting chemical signals into electrical activity.
These receptors have a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate ion channel in their structure which is activated by the neurotransmitter causing the receptor to change shape. The receptors for different neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and serotonin) are similar and can be classified as a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
Medically, this discovery holds promise for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
The main point of the passage is that:
   - Electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically;
   - The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in converting chemical signals into electrical activity;
   - The classification of the receptors for different neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and serotonin) into a family opens up opportunities for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders through the use of drugs targeting specific receptors on defined categories of neurons;
   - Promising research holds the potential to ameliorate debilitating conditions such as mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
The best option is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage is about how electrical signals in the brain were once believed to be the guiding force, but now we know that chemical signals are responsible for communication between neurons, specifically neurotransmitters secreted by excited neurons.
  These neurotransmitters bind with corresponding receptor molecules in receiving neurons and render them permeable to ions; the flow of these ions generates an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The theory of chemical transmission has gradually been accepted, and recent evidence shows that receptor molecules contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions.
  There are several types of receptors that follow this structure, and they come in varieties in different parts of the brain.
  This discovery is significant because it raises the possibility of selective treatment for certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons happens: electrical impulses traveling across synapses vs. neurotransmitters secreted by an excited neuron that bind with receptor molecules in the receiving neuron. 
  The alternative theory, that neurotransmitters play a role, has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community. 
  Researchers have discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region functioning as a channel for ions.
  Additionally, researchers have discovered that there are several types of receptors that closely resemble each other and come in several varieties.
  The discovery of these facts raises the possibility of the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
The passage describes a shift in the understanding of the workings of the brain guided by electrical versus chemical signals. 
The two theories are compared in the passage. 
The passage discusses neurotransmitters and their role in chemical signal transmission between neurons. 
Receptors and their role in the conversion of chemical signals to electrical activity are discussed in detail. 
Subtle differences in receptors may allow for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
The most comprehensive and accurate summary is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemical signals transmitted between neurons, mediated by neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
The receptors play a crucial role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
The subtle differences in receptors might allow for selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes how the theory about the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons being achieved through the leaping of synapses was replaced by the theory of chemical transmission through neurotransmitters.
  It also explains how this transmission happens between the neurons and the role of the neurotransmitter-gated ion channels in it.
  It further suggests how identifying the variations in these ion channels may lead to selective treatment of brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that chemical transmission through neurotransmitters play an essential role in the working of the brain, and identifying the variations in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channels may lead to a selective treatment of brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories about the working of the brain.
  According to one theory, electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons through synapses. But this theory was not fully understood.
  Another theory states that the communication between neurons is achieved chemically through the secretion of a neurotransmitter.
  This chemical transmission is through binding of the neurotransmitter to its corresponding receptor molecule.
  It was previously unclear how this binding would cause the receiving neuron to become permeable to ions.
  But some scientists have now discovered that the structure of the receptors plays an important role in this process.
  Different types of receptors exist for different chemicals and different parts of the brain.
  This discovery has medical significance because it offers the possibility to treat certain types of brain disorders selectively.
  So, the main point is that receptors that allow chemical transmission in the brain have been discovered and could be used to treat certain types of brain disorders selectively.
  The best answer is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two theories of the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons.
  The first theory is the old theory of electrical signals that travel via synapses.
  The second theory is a newer one that describes how neurotransmitters help transmit electrical impulses via their corresponding receptors.
  This second theory has gained more acceptance in the scientific community due to the discovery of the structure of receptors.
  The structure of receptors contains both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  This discovery is significant medically because it may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among receptors may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The main point of the passage is the evidence that the workings of the brain are guided, not by electrical signals, but by chemicals.
  This evidence has allowed scientists to classify these chemicals as a family.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and these contain enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  The discovery of differences among receptors in different parts of the brain allows the possibility of highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Choice A accurately and completely states the main point of the passage.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage discusses a theory about how communication between neurons happens in the brain.
  Neurobiologists once believed that the communication between neurons was electrical.
  An alternative theory was developed that said communication between neurons was chemical, via neurotransmitters that bind with neuroreceptors.
  Initially, there were concerns about how neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, but it was later discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Research shows that receptors for neurotransmitters containing a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions exist in the brain and can be used to treat certain brain disorders selectively.
  The passage is mainly focused on the chemical nature of communication between neurons and the significance (selective treatment of brain disorders) of the newly discovered receptors for neurotransmitters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The passage is about how the brain works and how neurobiologists used to think it worked.
  Neurobiologists used to think that electrical impulses from one neuron to the next leaped across the synapses.
  However, the alternative theory is that neurotransmitters excite the neurons.
  Neurotransmitters bind to receptor molecules in the receiving neuron and render it permeable to ions
  The latest research shows that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  This new discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  The main point of the passage is that the workings of the brain are guided by chemicals, not electrical signals, and that the differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

Topic: Law
Context: An organism is considered to have an infection when a disease-causing agent, called a pathogen, establishes a viable presence in the organism. This can occur only if the pathogenic agent is able to reproduce itself in the host organism. The only agents believed until recently to be responsible for infections—viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites—reproduce and regulate their other life processes by means of genetic material, composed of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA). It was thus widely assumed that all pathogens contain such genetic material in their cellular structure. This assumption has been challenged, however, by scientists seeking to identify the pathogen that causes Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans. CJD causes the brain to become riddled with tiny holes, like a sponge (evidence of extensive nerve cell death). Its symptoms include impaired muscle control, loss of mental acuity, memory loss, and chronic insomnia. Extensive experiments aimed at identifying the pathogen responsible for CJD have led surprisingly to the isolation of a disease agent lacking nucleic acid and consisting mainly, if not exclusively, of protein. Researchers coined the term "prion" for this new type of protein pathogen. Upon further study, scientists discovered that prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain; however, they possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape. Prions exhibiting this abnormal conformation were found to have infectious properties and the ability to reproduce themselves in an unexpected way, by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation. This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells. Because prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present. And in the absence of any effective therapy for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves, CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses. Although the discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens. Furthermore, it is now believed that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other, more common degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. This possibility has yet to be fully explored, however, and the exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the passage?
Choices:
  A: The only way in which CJD can be transmitted is through the injection of abnormally shaped prions from an infected individual into an uninfected individual.
  B: Most infectious diseases previously thought to be caused by other pathogens are now thought to be caused by prions.
  C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.
  D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD.
  E: Prion diseases generally progress more aggressively than diseases caused by other known pathogens.

Thought:
  The passage talks about Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a degenerative form of dementia.
  CJD is caused by pathogenic agent(s) lacking nucleic acid.
  These pathogenic agents are called prions and are composed mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that involves transforming normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, forming plaques that collect in the brain and destroy nerve cells.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are no effective therapies for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  The passage also indicates that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Alzheimers disease and Parkinson's disease are caused by different conformations of the same prion pathogen that causes CJD. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage explains the discovery of prions, a new protein pathogen that causes CJD.
  Prions are distinct from other pathogens in that they lack nucleic acid, and reproduce in an unusual manner.
  Researchers discovered that normal, harmless cellular prions are capable of transforming themselves into a pathogenic conformation upon contact with an infectious counterpart, initiating a chain reaction.
  This cascade of transformations leads to cellular destruction and the development of neurological symptoms.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body, the immune response is not produced by the body.
  CJD has no effective therapy at present and is fatal.
  The discovery of prions was initially viewed with skepticism but gradually gained acceptance.
  Prions may be involved in other degenerative neurological disorders.

Topic: Law
Context: David Warsh's book describes a great contradiction inherent in economic theory since 1776, when Adam Smith published The Wealth of Nations. Warsh calls it the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. Using the example of a pin factory, Smith emphasized the huge increases in efficiency that could be achieved through increased size. The pin factory's employees, by specializing on narrow tasks, produce far more than they could if each worked independently. Also, Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good, leading each individual as though "by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention." For example, businesses sell products that people want, at reasonable prices, not because the business owners inherently want to please people but because doing so enables them to make money in a competitive marketplace. These two concepts, however, are opposed to each other. The parable of the pin factory says that there are increasing returns to scale—the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. But increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. So given increasing returns, bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business, until each industry is dominated by just a few players. But for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power. Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing. For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory, with the Pin Factory de-emphasized. Why? As Warsh explains, it wasn't about ideology; it was about following the line of least mathematical resistance. Economics has always had scientific aspirations; economists have always sought the rigor and clarity that comes from representing their ideas using numbers and equations. And the economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns-the Pin Factory- are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. Many economists tried repeatedly to bring the Pin Factory into the mainstream of economic thought to reflect the fact that increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises, such as railroads. Yet they repeatedly failed because they could not state their ideas rigorously enough. Only since the late 1970s has this "underground river" -a term used to describe the role of increasing returns in economic thought-surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. By then, economists had finally found ways to describe the Pin Factory with the rigor needed to make it respectable.
Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the passage?
Choices:
  A: Mainstream economists have always assumed that returns to scale are generally increasing rather than decreasing.
  B: The functioning of the Invisible Hand is accepted primarily because diminishing returns can be described with mathematical rigor.
  C: Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory to be modeled even more rigorously than the Invisible Hand.
  D: Adam Smith was the first economist to understand how a market economy can enable individual self-interest to serve the common good.
  E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a contradiction in economic theory between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
  Adam Smith was the first to recognize how a market economy can harness self-interest to the common good. 
  Diminishing returns lend themselves to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns (the Pin Factory) are notoriously hard to represent mathematically. 
  Economists in the past had failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
  Recently, there have been developments in mathematics that allow for the Pin Factory to be modeled more rigorously. 
  The passage is mainly about the paradox between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand in the context of economic theory and how recent developments have allowed the increasing returns to scale to be accounted for.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The passage describes the contradiction that exists between the increasing returns to scale in economic theory and the principle of diminishing returns that supports the functioning of the Invisible Hand.
  The concept of diminishing returns could be described mathematically, and hence, economists found it easy to communicate the idea.
  However, increasing returns to scale, which dominated many enterprises such as railroads, have only recently been considered due to difficulty in modeling.
  The opposition between the Pin Factory and the principle of diminishing returns lasted for over two centuries.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that increasing returns to scale were disregarded in economic theory because the concept was challenging to model mathematically, even though a majority of enterprises operate under its principles.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
The passage discusses the inherent contradiction in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. It explains that although both concepts have been recognized since Adam Smith's time, the Pin Factory has been de-emphasized because it is hard to represent mathematically, whereas diminishing returns lend themselves to elegant formalism. Only in recent decades has the Pin Factory been increasingly recognized and made respectable through mathematical representation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses a contradiction in economic theory between the concept of the Pin Factory and that of the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory concept emphasizes the economic benefits of increasing returns to scale while the Invisible Hand concept recognizes the importance of self-interest in a free-market economy.
  These two concepts are incompatible in practice.
  Mainstream economic thought had previously emphasized diminishing returns over increasing returns to scale because the latter was difficult to represent mathematically.
  However, the growing importance of large businesses has brought more attention to the concept of increasing returns over the past few decades.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that the previous assumption that returns to scale were mainly diminishing has prevented economists from accounting for the increasing returns prevalent in most industries and understanding the possible negative consequences of the dominance of larger firms.
  The correct answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The passage describes the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory exemplifies increasing returns to scale.
  Increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, which goes against the idea of the Invisible Hand.
  Economists failed to account for increasing returns for almost two centuries because of the difficulty of representing increasing returns mathematically.
  Recent developments in mathematics have enabled the Pin Factory, which is an example of increasing returns, to be modeled more rigorously.
  The main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory, an example of increasing returns, has historically been a difficult concept for economists to model mathematically, which caused them to fail to account for increasing returns in their analyses. Until recently, mathematicians found ways to model the concept of increasing returns to scale, making it more mainstream in economic thought.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the concepts of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand, and how it led to failure of economists to properly explain increasing returns to scale.
  It explains how economists' scientific aspirations led to the de-emphasizing of the Pin Factory concept because it was hard to represent mathematically.
  The passage also notes increasing returns obviously characterized many enterprises that traditional economics failed to account for, but have become mainstream in recent decades.
  The main point of the passage is that economists have failed to properly explain increasing returns to scale because of the difficulty in representing the Pin Factory concept mathematically. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The passage discusses the conflict between two economic concepts, the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory suggests the economy can benefit from increasing returns to scale, but it can lead to monopolies, which go against the fundamental belief of the Invisible Hand.
  Diminishing returns to scale and the Invisible Hand dominated economic thought for almost two centuries and were expressed with mathematical rigor.
  Attempts were made to introduce the Pin Factory concept but failed due to the lack of mathematical rigor.
  However, increasing returns are becoming accepted in economic thought thanks to recent development in mathematics.
  The Pin Factory represents the increasing returns to scale that were and are observed in some of the industries.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that until recently, economists failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that is prevalent in many industries, and only recently has the concept attained mainstream acceptance in economics.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
The passage describes the historical inconsistency in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. It explains that increasing returns often lead to monopolies, which are inefficient and that the Invisible Hand works best in competitive markets with many competitors. The passage speculates that for centuries, economists justified diminishing returns as a means of coming up with mathematical models that describe economic systems. In recent decades, however, they've begun to incorporate the concept of increasing returns into their explanations. 
Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes a contradiction inherent in economic theory between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand concepts.
  The Pin Factory refers to the increasing returns to scale in many industries, while the Invisible Hand emphasizes the benefits of a market economy that harnesses self-interest to the common good.
  While increasing returns tend to cause monopolies, the proper functioning of the Invisible Hand depends on many competitors in each industry.
  For almost two centuries, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory because it represented the main line of mathematical resistance.
  Economists have only recently found ways to represent the Pin Factory with rigor to make it respectable.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
- The passage describes a contradiction in economic theory concerning the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
- The Pin Factory refers to the concept of increasing returns to scale; the Invisible Hand represents the market's ability to guide self-interested people to promote the common good.
- The conflict is that increasing returns create a natural monopoly, whereas the Invisible Hand requires a competitive market.
- Economists have favored diminishing returns because it is easier to represent mathematically.
- However, recent mathematical advancements have enabled economists to adequately model the Pin Factory.
- Therefore, the main point of the passage is that until somewhat recently, economists have largely failed to account for the increasing returns to scale that are common in many industries.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.

  A: Approximately 40 percent of the African American population left the Southern U.S. between 1915 and 1960-an event historians refer to as the Great Migration.
  B: The Great Migration was triggered by an increased labor demand in the North due to the onset of World War I and a reduced labor demand in the South due to a boll weevil infestation.
  C: Because earlier migrants helped defray the financial costs of migration for later migrants, African American migration to the Nortii accelerated at a time when income differences were narrowing.
  D: In migration movements, earlier migrants reduce the physical costs of moving and provide a cultural and linguistic cushion for later migrants.

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Insider-trading law makes it a crime to make stock transactions, or help others make stock transactions, based on information you have ahead of the general public because of your special position within a company. However, trading based on information you have that everyone else doesn't-isn't this part of the very definition of a functioning stock market? The entire field of stock brokering is based on people gaining knowledge that others don't have and then using it to profit themselves or their clients. If you analyze a stock, decide that it is overvalued, and sell it, you are taking advantage of knowledge that many others don?t have. That doesn't make you a criminal; it means you've done your homework. Stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible. Stock prices represent a constantly shifting amalgamation of everyone's information about and evaluations of a company's value. It helps when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them. Someone selling a stock because they know something will happen soon that will lower the stock's value helps spread the knowledge that the price ought to be dropping. Such actions help ensure that stock prices do reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts. That's good for everyone in the stock market. When contemplating insider-trading law, it helps to consider a far more widespread practice: "insider nontrading"-stock sales or purchases that would have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge. This is certainly happening every day, and rightfully so. No one would think to lock someone up for it. Passage B One of the basic principles of the stock market is transparency. In a transparent market, information that influences trading decisions is available to all participants at the same time. Success in the market can then be gained only by skill in analyzing the information and making good investing decisions. In a transparent stock market-everyone has the same chance of making a good investment, and success is based on individual merit and skill. In insider-trading situations, some people make investment decisions based on information that other people don't have. People who don't have access to the inside information can make similarly informed investment decisions. That unfairly compromises the market: people with inside information can make informed trade decisions far before everyone else, making it difficult or impossible for other people to earn money in the stock market. This, in turn, causes a loss of investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market. People invest in the stock market because they believe they can make money. The whole point of capital investments is to make good investing decisions and make money over time. If investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest. Undermining investor confidence would thus deny companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful, and it could ultimately lead to widespread financial repercussions.
Question: The authors would be most likely to agree that
Choices:
  A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market
  B: all information should be available to all market participants at the same time
  C: it is appropriate for investors to seek to gain an advantage by superior stock analysis
  D: insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading
  E: insider trading is the best means for disseminating information possessed by insiders
Response 0:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author argues that insider trading is not always bad because it helps in spreading information and making the stock prices reflect all the relevant facts, which is good for everyone in the market.
  In Passage B, the author provides a counter-argument arguing that in a transparent market, everyone has the same chance of making a good investment. 
  Both passages have different perspectives on the impact of insider trading and the importance of transparency in the stock market.
  The authors would most likely agree that transparency in the stock market is crucial and insider-trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market. 
  Option A is in agreement with both the passages, making it the correct answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Insider-trading provides certain individuals with advantage over other investors who don't have access to the same information.
  It leads to unequal transactions, unfair competition and undermines investor confidence.
  Since investors believe they can't make money, they won't invest.
  Insider trading violates the transparency of a stock market.
  The passage A explains that insider nontrading is a more widespread practice which is fair and accepted where sales or purchases wouldn't have been made, but aren't because of inside knowledge.
  The passage A also explains that stock markets work best when all the relevant information about a company is spread as widely as possible, as quickly as possible.
  Therefore, the authors of both passages would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Passage A argues that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts when those who have accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading situations unfairly compromise the market.
  Both passages agree that investor confidence is crucial to the success of the stock market.
  Therefore, the authors would be most likely to agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Passage A suggests that the spread of accurate information is good for everyone in the market.
  It also argues against locking people up for "insider nontrading".

  Therefore, it would be most likely that the authors agree that insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
  The answer is A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Author of Passage A accepts the notion of insider trading when it disseminates the knowledge and helps the stock market reflect more accurate values.
  The author of Passage B calls for transparency in the stock market, so everyone has the same chance of making good investments.
  Both authors agree about the importance of investor confidence in the stock market.
  A is consistent with the idea conveyed in both passages, while B does not satisfy the conditions set forth by the authors.
  C is consistent with the opinion expressed in Passage A, but not Passage B.
  D is not acceptable because Passage B proposes transparency in the market to gain investor confidence while passage A hesitates to call non-insider trading a crime.
  E is not a possible answer because both passages are against insider trading but still have different opinions about the degree of its impact.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Passage A argues that the insider trading law undermines the transparency principle of the stock market.
  Passage B argues that insider trading threatens investor confidence and ultimately could destroy the market.
  Both passages however do not endorse the practice of insider trading as being appropriate or ethical.
  Passage A acknowledges that insider trading and superior stock analysis are different.
  Passage B does not imply that insider nontrading should be regulated to the same extent as insider trading.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:

  Insider trading involves trading with information only known by a select few leading to an unfair market advantage.
  Passage B states that the basic principle of stock markets is transparency and access to information on an equal footing, without this principle it threatens investor confidence.
  The authors of both passages seem to agree that insider-trading is a problem. 
  Passage B focuses on the negative effects of insider trading, specifically capital investments that need to be made by investors when they believe they can make money and the wider-reaching financial repercussions if companies don't get enough funding. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  In Passage A, the author highlights that stock markets work best when people with accurate information about changing circumstances are permitted to act so that stock prices reflect them.
  In Passage B, the author emphasizes that a basic principle of the stock market is transparency where everyone has the same chance of making a good investment and success is based on individual merit and skill.
  The authors' viewpoints on insider trading are contrasting, but both mention the impact of such practices on the market and investor confidence.
  From both passages, it is evident that the transparency of the market is vital.
  The answer is most likely A: insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A suggests that the added knowledge possessed by insiders is useful for maximum dissemination of information and accurate stock prices, but insider trading should not be the means for utilizing such knowledge.
  Passage B suggests that transparency is the cornerstone of the stock market and information should be available to all participants to prevent unfair competition and loss of investor confidence.
  Therefore, the authors would most likely agree with Choice A- insider trading tends to undermine investor confidence in the stock market.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Passage A presents the idea that some insider trading can be good for the stock market and shareholder value.
  Passage B presents the idea that insider trading is unfair and should be prohibited.

Topic: Law
Context: Roughly 40 percent of the African American population of the Southern United States left the South between 1915 and 1960, primarily for the industrial cities of the North. While there was some African American migration to the North during the nineteenth century, most accounts point to 1915 as the start of what historians call the Great Migration. There were at least three catalysts of the Great Migration. First, World War I increased labor demand in the industrial North. Second, the war in Europe cut off immigration, which led many Northern employers to send labor agents to recruit African American labor in the South. Finally,a boll weevil infestation mined cotton crops and reduced labor demand in much of the South in the 1910s and 1920s. In short, the Great Migration began in 1915 and not earlier, because it was only then that the North-South income gap became large enough to start such a large-scale migration. Less dear, however, is why migration continued, and even accelerated, in subsequent decades, at the same time that North-South income differences were narrowing. We propose that once started, migration develops momentum over time as current migration reduces the difficulty and cost of future migration. Economists have typically assumed that people migrate if then- expected earnings in the destination exceed those of the origin enough to outweigh the difficulties and one-time costs of migration. Previous research suggests that the difficulties and costs arise from several sources. First, the uncertainty that potential migrants face concerning housing and labor-market conditions in the destination presents a significant hindrance. Second, there is the simple cost in terms of time and money of physically moving from the origin to the destination. Third, new migrants must familiarize themselves with local labor- and housing-market institutions once they arrive; they must find housing and work, and they must often adapt to a new culture or language. Empirical studies show that during the Great Migration, information was passed through letters that were often read by dozens of people and through conversation when migrants made trips back to their home communities. Thus early migrants provided information about labor- and housing-market conditions to friends and relatives who had not yet made the trip. First-time African American migrants often traveled with earlier migrants returning to the North after a visit to the South, which reduced physical costs. Additionally, previous migrants reduced new migrants * cost of adapting to a new locale and culture by providing them with temporary housing, food, and even credit. Previous migrants also provided a cultural cushion for later migrants, so that they did not have to struggle as hard with then- new surroundings.
Question: The primary purpose of the last sentence of the second paragraph is to
Choices:
  A: indicate why previous research on the Great Migration has been misguided
  B: extend the authors' explanation of the causes of the Great Migration to include later events
  C: challenge the traditional view that Northern wages were higher than Southern wages prior to 1915
  D: present a fact about the Great Migration that the authors seek to explain

Topic: Law
Context: Passage A Jury nullification occurs when the jury acquits the defendant in a criminal case in disregard of the judge's instructions and contrary to the jury's findings of fact. Sometimes a jury's nullification decision is based on mercy for the defendant, sometimes on dislike for the victim. Juries have also sometimes nullified when the defendant engaged in civil disobedience and the jurors agreed with the actions. While instances of jury nullification are probably few, the problems created by the jury's power to nullify are great. First, we do not know how the power is used. Because juries are not required to and typically do not explain their verdicts, it is impossible to say how often nullification occurs. This means that we also do not know how often juries use this power for evil ends rather than for good ones. Second, juries often have insufficient evidence to make a reasoned nullification decision. Evidence that might inform such a decision, such as a defendant's past brushes with the law, usually is not admitted at trial because it is irrelevant to the technical question of guilt or innocence. Third, jurors are not legislators. We have an elected legislature to pass laws and elected or appointed judges to interpret them. The jury is unelected, is unaccountable, and has no obligation to think through the effect an acquittal will have on others. Reasonable people can disagree on the proper reach of the criminal laws. Nevertheless, the place for them to disagree is in public, where the reasons for revisions of the laws can be scrutinized and debated. Passage B Police and prosecutors have discretion to decide which violations of the law to pursue and which to overlook. Even with such discretion, however, these officials can sometimes be overzealous. In such cases, the jury can act as a safety valve and use its own discretion to decide, for example, that a case is too trivial or the circumstances too extenuating for the case to result in a conviction. When a jury nullifies because it does not believe a law should be applied to a particular defendant, the jury can also be viewed as assisting the legislature. Legislatures create general laws both because they cannot foresee every variation that may arise, and because legislators often have competing views about what should be included in legislation. and.so must settle for broad language if any laws are to be passed. Similarly, when a jury nullifies because it believes a law is unjust, it also performs a useful function vis-a-vis the legislature, namely indicating to the legislature that there may be a problem with the law in question.It may happen that a jury will be persuaded to nullify by factors they should ignore, but such instances of nullification are likely to be uncommon. For a jury to agree to nullify means that the case for nullification must be so compelling that all twelve of the jurors, despite their different backgrounds and perspectives, nevertheless agree that nullification is the appropriate course of action.

  Therefore, the most accurate characterization of the relationship between the two passages is that Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Passage A discusses jury nullification and its problems.
  Passage B argues that jury nullification can be useful and justifies the practice.
  The relationship between the two passages is that Passage A and Passage B present differing views on jury nullification.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Passage A and B both discuss the topic of jury nullification.
  Passage A presents a critical view of jury nullification, highlighting its problems and limitations.
  Passage B presents a supportive view of jury nullification, highlighting its potential benefits and usefulness.
  Therefore, the relationship between the two passages can be described as a contrast between a critical viewpoint (A) and a supportive viewpoint (B).
  The answer is A: Passage A offers a critique of a power possessed by juries, while passage B argues in support of that power. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Passage A discusses the problems created by the jury's power to nullify.
  Passage B suggests that jury nullification can be a helpful mechanism that assists the legislature when the law is too general or possibly unjust in a given circumstance.
  Therefore, passages A and B partially agree on the concept of jury nullification, while passage A focuses on its problems, passage B proposes a broader perspective of it as a valuable procedure.
  The best answer is B: Passage A denounces a judicial custom, while passage B proposes improvements to that custom.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:

Topic: Law
Context: The characteristic smell or taste of a plant, to insects as well as to humans, depends on its chemical composition. Broadly speaking, plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary. The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants. The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism. Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family. It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells. Insects appear to have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today. Such substances undoubtedly first appeared, and new ones continue to appear, as the result of genetic mutations in individual plants. But if a mutation is to survive and be passed on to subsequent generations, it must pass the muster of natural selection—that is, it must increase the likelihood of the organism's surviving and reproducing. Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms. Such scents signal the presence of nectar, which nourishes the insects without damage to the plants. Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects. Some of these defensive substances cause insects to suffer unpleasant symptoms or even to die. Still other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. For hundreds of millions of years there has been an evolutionary competition for advantage between plants and plant-eating insects. If insects are to survive as the plants they eat develop defenses against them, they must switch to other foods or evolve ways to circumvent the plants' defenses. They may evolve a way to detoxify a harmful substance, to store it in their bodies out of harm's way, or to avoid its effects in some other manner. Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both. As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect; species of insects have thus tended to become associated with narrowly defined and often botanically restricted groups of plants.
Question: Which one of the following describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances?
Choices:
  A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  C: Mechanical components such as gears and rotors are required for the operation of clothing factories; electrical components such as wires and transformers supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  D: Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop; such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  E: Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors; such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question is asking for a relationship that describes the similarities between primary and secondary substances and something else.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  They are called secondary because they have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms or they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  Both primary and secondary substances are found in plants and have important functions in the survival of the plant.
  Therefore, the best analogy is B, where mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them. Just like the primary substances, the engines, and transmissions are required for the proper functioning of automobiles. Similarly, features such as paint and taillights are not required for the functioning of automobiles, just as secondary substances are not required for the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
The passage describes two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary. Primary substances play a critical role in the plant's internal chemical processes, growth, and metabolism. Secondary substances are not essential to the plant's internal processes but are responsible for the plant's distinctive taste and smell. 
The description of the relationship between plant and primary and secondary substances does not fit any of the relationship models described in the answer choices. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances - primary substances being necessary for the growth and functioning of plants while secondary substances are responsible for the distinctive tastes and smells of the plants.
  In each of the answer choices, two components are present, and one component is necessary for the other.
  A describes the relationship of supplying electricity as necessary for hospitals to function properly and a backup power source is used in case of temporary power loss.
  B describes the relationship of mechanical components necessary for automobiles to run and features that give a car its aesthetic appearance or improve safety.

Topic: Law
Context: Most sociohistorical interpretations of are view a body of work as the production of a class, generally a dominant or governing class, imposing its ideals. For example, Richard Taruskin writes in his Oxford History of Western Music that one of the defining characteristics of "high art" is that "it is produced by and for political and social elites." What Taruskin and others fail to clarify, however, is that there are two different ways that art, historically, was "produced by and for political and social elites." The first way was for a member of the elite to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display. For instance, if one commissions a famous architect to design one's house, that may reflect great credit on one's taste, even if one finds the house impossible to live in. The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life, like Raphael's frescoes in the Vatican apartmentscommissioned by Pope Julius II.Sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist. For this kind of analysis to work,however, it must be the case that the elite had a recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived, and it must also be the case that we can eliminate the possibility that artists subverted the ideals of the patron for their own reasons. Historically, the two social classes able to commission art were the aristocratic, or governing class, and the well-to-do middle class, what used to be called die bourgeoisie. The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures. In his characterization of nineteenth-century English culture, cultural critic Matthew Arnold identified the aristocracy as Barbarians, interested largely in fox hunting and gaming, and the middle class as Philistines, obsessed with respectability. As a result, the more talented artists sometimes had to find a place in the margins of the establishment-engaged by a rich patron with eccentric tastes, for example. Moreover, a great deal of art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings. Because some of this art endured, the sociohistorical critic, like Taruskin, must engage in an analogue of Freudian analysis, and claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
Question: The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to which one of the following views?
Choices:
  A: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  B: The most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  E: The most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The passage suggests that Taruskin and others analyze art that embodies the ideology of the elite.
  It also suggests that artists sometimes subvert the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  In addition, some art that goes against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  When art endures, it is claimed that it embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position implies that if high art appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses two different ways that art was produced for the political and social elite.
  The second way, where art reflects and mirrors the elite's ideals and way of life, is preferred by sociohistorical critics like Taruskin.
  For this view to work, the elite must have a recognizable identity and a consensus about the world and how to live in it.
  The middle class and the aristocracy were historically able to commission art.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced art that endures.
  Some artists who went against the grain of elite values found a place in the margins of the establishment while others were paid unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position might suggest that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Taruskin's position is discussed in the second paragraph.
  According to the passage, Taruskin and other sociohistorical critics analyze art produced by "creating a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life."
  This type of art must embody the ideology of the elite, regardless of the artist's identity.
  The passage further suggests that not all art produced by the elite reflects their values, and that sometimes artists subverted the ideals of the patron.
  The passage does not suggest that the most talented artists subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.
  Therefore, answer E cannot be correct.
  The passage does not provide any information on the success of artists working today.
  Therefore, answer B cannot be correct.
  The passage suggests that sometimes high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite is actually supported by them in some way, but it does not suggest that this is always the case.
  Therefore, answer C cannot be correct.
  The passage does not suggest that typically art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The passage discusses two ways that art was produced for political and social elites.
  The first way was by commissioning well-known artists to produce something for display.
  The second way was by creating a work that expresses the elites' ideals and way of life.
  Sociohistorical critics, like Taruskin, prefer to deal with art produced the second way because they can analyze it for how it embodies the ideology of the elite.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied or subverted the ideology of the elite.
  The passage states that some of the art that endured went against the grain of elite values and was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  The sociohistorical critic must claim that such art embodied the ideals of the elite in hidden ways.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The passage discusses how art was produced by and for political and social elites. 
  For sociohistorical critics like Taruskin, it is important to examine the art produced by elites for subtle analysis of how it embodied the elite ideology. 
  Sometimes more talented artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment, which means not all art produced by elites embodied the elite ideology.
  Sometimes art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  It is therefore likely that Taruskin does not believe that the most talented artists produced work that embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The passage describes Taruskin's position as dealing with art produced by the elites that embodied their ideology, and enabled subtle analysis of it.
  It suggests that this kind of analysis only works if the artists did not subvert the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to any of the other options.
  Option (A) and (E) contradict each other, so at least one of them is incorrect.
  The passage does not mention anything about successful artists today or the social class of the artists who produce art reflecting the ideology of elites.
  Option (C) is contradicted by the passage stating that art that went against the grain of elite values was often paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.

Response 8:
Thought:
  Taruskin's view is focused on art produced by and for the political and social elite.
  Taruskin believes that such art embodies the ideology of the elite, regardless of the identity of the artist.
  Historically, two social classes were able to commission art: the aristocratic/governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  It is not always the case that the taste of these social classes was apt to produce enduring art.
  Some art that went against the grain of elite values endured.
  Taruskin's view requires a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, which is revealed by work of which they disapprove.
  None of the answer choices suggest as specifically Taruskin's position.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that Taruskin has a preference for analyzing art that was produced to express and mirror one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical analysis of such art is done to understand the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Taruskin does not clarify that there are two different ways that art was "produced by and for political and social elites."
  It must be the case that the elite had recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced art that endures.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.

Topic: Law
Context: One of the more striking developments in modem North American dance was African American choreographer Katherine Dunham's introduction of a technique known as dance-isolation, in which one part of the body moves in one rhythm while other parts are kept stationary or are moved in different rhythms. The incorporation of this technique into North American and European choreography is relatively recent, although various forms of the technique have long been essential to traditional dances of certain African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures. Dunham's success in bringing dance-isolation and other traditional techniques from those cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance is due in no small part to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.As an anthropologist in the 1930s, Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology. Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research, primarily because most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry. Moreover, no other social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research. Starting in 1935, Dunham conducted a series of research projects into traditional Caribbean dance forms, with special interest in their origins in African culture. Especially critical to her success was her approach to research, which diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time. Colleagues in anthropology advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances, and because they subscribed to the long-standing view, now fortunately recognized as unrealistic, that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment. But because of her interest and her skill as a performer, she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself. Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet. Between 1937 and 1945, Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago. The ballets she created in this fashion were among the first North American dances to rectify the exclusion of African American themes from the medium of modern dance. Her work was thus crucial in establishing African American dance as an art form in its own right, making possible future companies such as Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem.

  The passage refers to the prevailing view of social scientists in the 1930s towards dance research.
  The author suggests that the view was not conducive to studying dance ethnology.
  One specific view held by the peers of this time is questioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that the peers would have been most likely to agree with options A, C, D or E.
  Option B contradicts the passage's point that Dunham was "among the pioneers" in the field of dance ethnology and that experts in dance were not trained in social research methods.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in the passage would have been most likely to disagree with option B.
  So, the answer is not in the options, because it asks for the statement the peers would most likely agree with, but rather highlights a statement that the peers would be likely not to agree with.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The passage discusses how dance has been neglected in the field of social research, and how Katherine Dunham's approach diverged from the prevailing methodology.
  Line 23 states that "most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry."
  This suggests that Dunham's approach was not considered scientifically rigorous or legitimate by her peers.
  The peers referred to in line 22 are most likely social scientists who were working in the field of dance ethnology.
  Therefore, the statement that Dunham's peers would have agreed with is likely to refer to their views on research methodology in dance ethnology.
  Choice B, which asserts that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data, is consistent with the view that social scientists held at the time. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The peers mentioned in Line 22 are social scientists who neglected dance as an area of social research.
  They did so primarily because they favored scientific rigor and detachment.
  Therefore, they would not welcome a methodology of dance research that involves participation and immersion.
  They would most likely agree with the statement that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage mentions that previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists gravitated towards areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous modes of inquiry.
  Therefore, the peers referred to in the passage thought that there were other areas that were more important/relevant for social research.
  Based on this, the best answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  This is because peers in the field of social research didn't see dance as an area worthy of research in the first place, let alone think that methodological expertise in dance was necessary for research purposes.

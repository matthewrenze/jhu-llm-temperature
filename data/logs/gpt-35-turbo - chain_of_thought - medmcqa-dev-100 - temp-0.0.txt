Question: Obstructive sleep apnoea caused by the following
Choices:
  A: Mandibular ameloblasma
  B: Dentigerous cyst
  C: Orbital fracture
  D: Bilateral TMJ ankylosis
Response 0:
Thought:
  Obstructive sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep.
  It is caused by a blockage of the airway, usually when the soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses during sleep.
  Mandibular ameloblastoma and dentigerous cyst are benign tumors that can occur in the jaw, but they are not known to cause obstructive sleep apnoea.
  Orbital fracture is a break in the bones surrounding the eye, which can cause double vision, but it is not known to cause obstructive sleep apnoea.
  Bilateral TMJ ankylosis is a condition where the jaw joint is fused, which can cause difficulty opening the mouth, but it is not known to cause obstructive sleep apnoea.
  Therefore, none of the given options are the correct answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Question: Gum pads are divided into following segments:
Choices:
  A: 3 in each quadrant
  B: 2 in each jaw
  C: 5 in each quadrant
  D: 2 in each quadrant
Response 0:
Thought:
  Gum pads are used to protect the gums during dental procedures.
  The number of gum pads used may vary depending on the procedure.
  However, the question is asking for the standard number of gum pads per segment.
  A quadrant is one-fourth of the mouth.
  Therefore, the answer should be in terms of quadrants.
  Option A states that there are 3 gum pads in each quadrant, which would mean a total of 12 gum pads in the mouth.
  Option B states that there are 2 gum pads in each jaw, which would mean a total of 4 gum pads in the mouth.
  Option C states that there are 5 gum pads in each quadrant, which would mean a total of 20 gum pads in the mouth.
  Option D states that there are 2 gum pads in each quadrant, which would mean a total of 8 gum pads in the mouth.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The instrument formula given by G.V. Black is a standard formula for dental instruments.
  The primary cutting edge angle is the angle between the face of the blade and the surface being cut.
  A larger angle would make the instrument more efficient in cutting, but it would also increase the risk of damaging the surrounding tissues.

Question: A lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years will show
Choices:
  A: PDL fibres attached to cementum
  B: PDL fibres attached to dentin
  C: Epithelium adjacent to previously denuded root surface
  D: Co adaptation to the remaining fibres
Response 0:
Thought:
  A lateral sliding flap is a surgical procedure that involves the reflection of a flap of gingival tissue to expose the underlying tooth root.
  Roots denuded for 6 years means that the root surface has been exposed for 6 years.
  PDL fibres attach the tooth to the surrounding bone and cementum.
  If the root surface has been denuded for 6 years, it is likely that the PDL fibres have been lost.
  Therefore, the lateral sliding flap done on a tooth with roots denuded for 6 years will show epithelium adjacent to the previously denuded root surface.

Question: A primigravida came to the labor room at 40 weeks + 5 days gestation for induction of labor. On per vaginal examination, the cervix is 1 cm dilated and 30% effaced. The veex is at --1 station and the cervix is soft and posterior. What will be the modified bishop score for this lady?
Choices:
  A: 0
  B: 3
  C: 5
  D: 8
Response 0:
Thought:
  The Bishop score is used to assess the readiness of the cervix for induction of labor.
  The score is based on five components: cervical dilation, cervical effacement, cervical consistency, cervical position, and fetal station.
  The maximum score is 13, and a score of 8 or higher indicates that the cervix is favorable for induction.
  In this case, the cervix is 1 cm dilated, 30% effaced, soft, and posterior, and the fetal station is -1.
  Therefore, the modified Bishop score for this lady will be 5.

Question: Looseness seen in a recently delivered RPD is due to:
Choices:
  A: Defective occlusal balancing
  B: Passive clasp on abutment
  C: Thin flange
  D: Insufficient overlap on posterior teeth
Response 0:
Thought:
  RPD stands for Removable Partial Denture.
  Looseness in RPD can be due to various reasons.
  Passive clasp on abutment means the clasp is not engaging the abutment tooth.
  Thin flange means the part of the denture that extends towards the cheeks or lips is thin.
  Insufficient overlap on posterior teeth means the denture is not covering enough of the teeth.

Question: Object permanence seen in which stage of Jean Piaget’s theory
Choices:
  A: Sensorimotor
  B: Pre-operational stage
  C: Concrete operations stage
  D: Formal operations stage
Response 0:
Thought:
  Object permanence is the understanding that objects continue to exist even when they cannot be seen, heard, or touched.
  Jean Piaget's theory of cognitive development describes four stages of cognitive development.
  The sensorimotor stage is the first stage of cognitive development, which occurs from birth to around two years of age.
  During this stage, infants learn about the world through their senses and motor activities.
  Object permanence is a major achievement of the sensorimotor stage.

Question: A 70 years old hypeensive patient with stage 5 chronic kidney disease was diagnosed recently with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. He doesn't want to take injectable insulin. Which of the following oral hypoglycemic agents will be preferred in this patient, which won't require any renal dose modification?
Choices:
  A: Linagliptin
  B: Repaglinide
  C: Vildagliptin
  D: Glimepiride
Response 0:

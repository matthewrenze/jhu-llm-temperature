Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the formula for the equation of a line to find the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  We know that the initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$.
  We also know that the value of the equipment after 12 years is $\$ 0$.
  Therefore, we can find the slope of the line as follows:
  slope = (change in value) / (change in time) = ($0 - \$ 32,400$) / (12 years) = $-2700/year$
  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can find the value of the equipment after 4 years as follows:
  value = slope * time + initial value = $-2700/year * 4 years + \$ 32,400 = \$ 20,400$
  Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$ 20,400$ 4 years after it is purchased.
  The answer is C: $\$ 21,600$.

Question: $$\frac{a-b}{a}=c$$In the equation above, if $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: $c>1$
  B: $c=1$
  C: $c=-1$
  D: $c<-1$
Response 0:
Thought:
  If $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, then $a-b$ is negative.
  Since $a$ is negative, $-a$ is positive.
  Therefore, $\frac{a-b}{a}=\frac{-1(a-b)}{-1a}=\frac{b-a}{-a}=\frac{a-b}{a}=c$.
  Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $a-b$ is negative and $|a-b|=b-a$.
  Therefore, $c=\frac{a-b}{a}=\frac{b-a}{-a}=\frac{|a-b|}{a}$.
  Since $a$ is negative and $b$ is positive, $|a-b|=b-a$ is positive.
  Therefore, $c=\frac{|a-b|}{a}>0$.
  If $c>1$, then $|a-b|>a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.
  If $c=1$, then $|a-b|=a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.
  If $c=-1$, then $|a-b|=-a$, which is not possible since $|a-b|$ is positive and $a$ is negative.

Question: $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$The equation above is true for all $x$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants. What is the value of $a b$ ?
Choices:
  A: 18
  B: 20
  C: 24
  D: 40
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can start by expanding the left side of the equation.
  $$(a x+3)\left(5 x^{2}-b x+4\right)=20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  $$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 12 = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  $$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 12 - 20 x^{3}+9 x^{2}+2 x-12 = 0$$
  $$-15ax^3 + abx^2 + 29x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 24 = 0$$
  We know that this equation is true for all values of $x$, which means that the coefficients of each term must be equal to the corresponding coefficients on the right side of the equation.
  Equating the coefficients of $x^3$, we get $-15a = 20$, which gives us $a = -\frac{4}{3}$.
  Equating the coefficients of $x^2$, we get $ab = 29$, substituting $a = -\frac{4}{3}$, we get $b = -\frac{87}{4}$.
  Therefore, $ab = -\frac{4}{3} \times -\frac{87}{4} = 29$.

  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is a linear function.
  The function can be represented in the form of $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept of the line.
  The slope of the line is the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight of the merchandise.
  We can find the slope by using any two points from the table.
  Let's use the points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(10, 21.89)$.
  The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$.
  Therefore, the slope of the line is $m=0.99$.
  The y-intercept of the line is the shipping charge when the weight of the merchandise is zero.
  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge is $\$16.94$ when the weight of the merchandise is $5$ pounds.
  Therefore, the y-intercept of the line is $b=16.94$.
  Hence, the function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99x+16.94$.

Topic: Math
Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The total number of participants is 300.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants is 36.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants is p.
  The percentage of participants who chose the first picture among all participants is greater than 20%.
  We need to find the inequality that best describes the possible values of p.
  We know that $0.20(300) = 60$.
  We also know that the number of participants who chose the first picture is greater than 20% of all participants.
  Therefore, $36+p > 0.20(300)$.
  Solving for p, we get $p > 0.20(300) - 36$.
  This simplifies to $p > 24$.
  We also know that $p \leq 150$.
  Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of p is A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$.

  Let's use the two given points to find the equation of the line and then substitute $(0,0)$ to solve for $k$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.
  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
  $y - k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(x - 2)$
  Substituting $(0,0)$, we get:
  $-k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$
  Solving for $k$, we get:

The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We know that y = 2x.
  We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  To do that, we need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and add the expected increase in 2014.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula (5,880 + x*5,880) * (1 + y/100) = S, where S is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We can solve for y to get y = 0.1.
  Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (5,880 * 1.1) = 6,468.
  The answer is D: 6,468.

  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula (5,880 + x*5,880) * (1 + y/100) = S, where S is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We can solve for y to get y = 0.1.
  Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (5,880 * 1.1) = 6,468.

  The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year.
  After 10 years, the value of the machine will be $\$ 30,000$.
  The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$.
  The value of the machine decreases linearly over time.
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is a linear equation of the form $v = mt + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  We can use the two given points $(0, 120000)$ and $(10, 30000)$ to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the equation.
  The slope is $m = \frac{30000 - 120000}{10 - 0} = -9000$.

  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is $v = -9000t + 120000$.
  The answer is B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year.
  After 10 years, the value of the machine will be $\$ 30,000$.
  The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$.
  The value of the machine decreases linearly over time.
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is a linear equation of the form $v = mt + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  We can use the two given points $(0, 120000)$ and $(10, 30000)$ to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the equation.
  The slope is $m = \frac{30000 - 120000}{10 - 0} = -9000$.
  The $y$-intercept is $b = 120000$.
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is $v = -9000t + 120000$.
  The answer is B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$.

Question: A cargo helicopter delivers only 100-pound packages and 120-pound packages. For each delivery trip, the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, and the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. What is the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 4
  C: 5
  D: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 380 is 300, which means that x <= 3.
  If x = 3 and y = 6, then the total weight is 100(3) + 120(6) = 780, which is less than or equal to 1,100.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6.

  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6.
  The answer is D: 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 380 is 300, which means that x <= 3.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$.
  The equation of the line is $y=25$.
  To find the intersection points, we set the two equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.

  Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x-11=\pm5$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x=6$ or $x=16$.
  Therefore, the points of intersection are $(6,25)$ and $(16,25)$.
  The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{100}=10$.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The oil and gas production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013.
  The difference in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The production decreased over 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13).
  Therefore, the production decreased at a constant rate of 2.1/13 million barrels per year.
  The function that models the production is of the form f(t) = mt + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the function is the rate of decrease, which is -2.1/13.
  The y-intercept is the production in 2000, which is 4.
  Therefore, the function that models the production is f(t) = -2.1/13 t + 4.
  Simplifying the function, we get f(t) = -0.162 t + 4.

  The difference in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The production decreased over 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13).
  Therefore, the production decreased at a constant rate of 2.1/13 million barrels per year.
  The function that models the production is of the form f(t) = mt + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the function is the rate of decrease, which is -2.1/13.
  The y-intercept is the production in 2000, which is 4.
  Therefore, the function that models the production is f(t) = -2.1/13 t + 4.
  Simplifying the function, we get f(t) = -0.162 t + 4.
  The function that best models the production is D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$.

Topic: Math
Question: Townsend Realty purchased the Glenview Street property and received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price along with an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash. Which of the following best approximates the original price, in dollars, of the Glenview Street property?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 350,000$
  B: $\$ 291,700$
  C: $\$ 233,300$
  D: $\$ 175,000$
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume the original price of the property is $x$ dollars.
Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, which means they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.
Therefore, the price after the first discount is $0.6x$ dollars.
They also received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8(0.6x) = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price, which is $x$ dollars.
We can set up an equation to solve for $x$:
$$0.48x = x - 0.4x$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$0.08x = x \cdot 0.4$$
$$0.08x = 0.4x$$
$$0.32x = 0$$
$$x = 0$$
This is not possible, so there must be an error in the problem.
Perhaps the answer choices were meant to be percentages instead of dollar amounts.
Without further information, we cannot determine the correct answer.
Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".

Thought:
- We are looking for the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y.
- We can find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can find the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can then divide the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream to get the probability.

Action: 
- Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream = 39 + 125 = 164
- Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream = 11 + 68 = 79

Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's first find out how many hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland's job.
  Let's assume the electrician worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job.
  Then, the electrician worked for $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job.
  We can use the given equation to calculate the cost of each job.
  For Mr. Roland's job, the cost is $C=75x+125$ dollars.
  For Ms. Sanchez's job, the cost is $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$ dollars.
  The difference in cost between the two jobs is $75x+225-(75x+125)=100$ dollars.
  Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.
  The answer is not one of the available choices.
  Therefore, the closest answer is C: $\$ 150$.

Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Thought:
  The energy in a granola bar comes entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate.
  The energy per gram of protein is 4.0 food calories.
  The energy per gram of fat is 9.0 food calories.
  The energy per gram of carbohydrate is 4.0 food calories.
  Let $p$, $f$, and $c$ be the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar, respectively.
  The total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories.
  Therefore, $4p+9f+4c=180$.
  We need to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $9f=180-4p-4c$.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
  Therefore, the answer is B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

Thought:
  The vertex of a parabola is located at the point $(h,k)$ where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex and $k$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.
  The standard form of a quadratic function is $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex of the parabola.
  The given function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be expanded to $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$.
  The vertex of the parabola $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$ can be found by completing the square or using the formula $h=-\frac{b}{2a}$.
  The coefficient of $x^2$ is $a=1$ and the coefficient of $x$ is $b=4$.
  Therefore, $h=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$.
  The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $h=-2$.
  The answer is A: $-4<x<-3$ because $-4<-2<-3$.

  $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18(x+y)$$
  $$0.10 x+0.20 y=0.18 x+0.18 y$$
  $$0.02 x=0.02 y$$
  $$x=y$$
  We know that Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution.
  Let's use $y$ to represent the amount of $20 \%$ by mass saline solution Clayton uses.
  Therefore, $y=100$.
  We also know that $x=y$.
  Therefore, $x=100$.
  Clayton must use 100 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
  The answer is D: 100.

  B: $x=-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{30}}{3}$
  C: $x=-6 \pm \sqrt{2}$
  D: $x=-6 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can solve the quadratic equation $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$ by using the quadratic formula $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$ where $a=3, b=12,$ and $c=6$.
  Substituting the values of $a, b,$ and $c$ in the quadratic formula, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$.
  Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{72}}{6}$.
  Further simplifying, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm 6 \sqrt{2}}{6}$.
  Factoring out $6$ in the numerator, we get $x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2}}{1}$.
  Therefore, the solutions to the equation $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$ are $x=-2 \pm \sqrt{2}$.

The outlier measurement of 24 inches is an error. Of the mean, median, and range of the values listed, which will change the most if the 24 -inch measurement is removed from the data?
Choices:
  A: Mean
  B: Median
  C: Range
  D: They will all change by the same amount.
Response 0:
Thought:
  To determine which measure will change the most if the outlier is removed, we need to calculate the mean, median, and range of the data set with and without the outlier.
  The mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values.
  The median is the middle value when the data set is arranged in order.
  The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
  The outlier is 24, and there are 21 values in the data set.
  Without the outlier, there are 20 values in the data set.
  We can calculate the mean by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
  We can calculate the median by arranging the values in order and finding the middle value.
  We can calculate the range by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.
  Let's calculate the mean, median, and range with and without the outlier:
  
  With outlier:
  Mean = (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16+24)/21 = 12
  Median = 12
  Range = 24 - 8 = 16
  
  Without outlier:
  Mean = (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16)/20 = 11.5
  Median = (12+12)/2 = 12
  Range = 16 - 8 = 8
  
  The mean changes the most when the outlier is removed.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Mean.

  We can calculate the range by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.
  Let's calculate the mean, median, and range with and without the outlier:
  
  With outlier:
  Mean = (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16+24)/21 = 12
  Median = 12
  Range = 24 - 8 = 16

Topic: Math
Question: A rectangle was altered by increasing its length by 10 percent and decreasing its width by $p$ percent. If these alterations decreased the area of the rectangle by 12 percent, what is the value of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 22
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume that the original length and width of the rectangle are $l$ and $w$, respectively. 
The original area of the rectangle is $lw$. 
After the alterations, the new length of the rectangle is $1.1l$ and the new width is $(1-p/100)w$. 
The new area of the rectangle is $(1-0.12)lw = 0.88lw$. 
We can set up an equation using the information above and solve for $p$.

$(1.1l)(1-\frac{p}{100})w = 0.88lw$

$1.1(1-\frac{p}{100}) = 0.88$

$1-\frac{p}{100} = \frac{0.88}{1.1}$

$1-\frac{p}{100} = 0.8$

$\frac{p}{100} = 0.2$

$p = 20$

Therefore, the value of $p$ is 20.

Let's assume that the original length and width of the rectangle are $l$ and $w$, respectively. 
The original area of the rectangle is $lw$. 
After the alterations, the new length of the rectangle is $1.1l$ and the new width is $(1-p/100)w$. 
The new area of the rectangle is $(1-0.12)lw = 0.88lw$. 
We can set up an equation using the information above and solve for $p$.

$(1.1l)(1-\frac{p}{100})w = 0.88lw$

$1.1(1-\frac{p}{100}) = 0.88$

  We can expand the left side of the equation and compare the coefficients with the right side of the equation to find the values of $c$.
  The left side of the equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$.
  We can compare the coefficients of the left and right sides of the equation to get the following system of equations:
  $a b=15$

  $8a-a^{2}=15$
  $a^{2}-8a+15=0$
  $(a-3)(a-5)=0$
  $a=3$ or $a=5$
  If $a=3$, then $b=5$.
  If $a=5$, then $b=3$.
  We can substitute these values of $a$ and $b$ into the second equation to find the values of $c$.

  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.
  We can use substitution to solve for $a$ and $b$.
  $a=8-b$
  $b=8-a$
  Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
  $(8-a)(a)=15$
  $8a-a^{2}=15$
  $a^{2}-8a+15=0$
  $(a-3)(a-5)=0$
  $a=3$ or $a=5$
  If $a=3$, then $b=5$.
  If $a=5$, then $b=3$.
  We can substitute these values of $a$ and $b$ into the second equation to find the values of $c$.
  If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $c=7(3)+2(5)=21$.
  If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $c=7(5)+2(3)=41$.
  Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 21 and 41.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We can use the formula for a linear function: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$.
  The slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$: $m=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}\approx7.5$.
  We can use the slope and one point to find the y-intercept: $(128, 950)$.
  We can substitute the slope and y-intercept into the formula for a linear function to get the answer.

  We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We can use the formula for a linear function: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$.
  The slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$: $m=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}\approx7.5$.
  We can use the slope and one point to find the y-intercept: $(128, 950)$.
  We can substitute the slope and y-intercept into the formula for a linear function to get the answer.
  The answer is D: $r(p)=7.5p-10$.

Question: Roberto is an insurance agent who sells two types of policies: a $\$ 50,000$ policy and a $\$ 100,000$ policy. Last month, his goal was to sell at least 57 insurance policies. While he did not meet his goal, the total value of the policies he sold was over $\$ 3,000,000$. Which of the following systems of inequalities describes $x$, the possible number of $\$ 50,000$ policies, and $y$, the possible number of $\$ 100,000$ policies, that Roberto sold last month?
Choices:
  A: $x+y<57$ $50,000 x+100,000 y<3,000,000$

Question: The first year Eleanor organized a fund-raising event, she invited 30 people. For each of the next 5 years, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year. If $f(n)$ is the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event, which of the following statements best describes the function $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: The function $f$ is a decreasing linear function.
  B: The function $f$ is an increasing linear function.
  C: The function $f$ is a decreasing exponential function.
  D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.
Response 0:
Thought:
  In the first year, Eleanor invited 30 people.
  For the second year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 30 = 60$ people.
  For the third year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 60 = 120$ people.
  For the fourth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 120 = 240$ people.
  For the fifth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is $2 \times 240 = 480$ people.
  Therefore, the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event can be represented by the function $f(n) = 30 \times 2^{n-1}$.
  This is an increasing exponential function because the base of the exponent is greater than 1, and as $n$ increases, $f(n)$ increases exponentially.

  Therefore, the total number of calories from Super Grain cereal is $240x$.
  The total number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=280-280x$.
  The total number of calories from both cereals is $240x+280-280x=280$.
  Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{1}{2}$.
  Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.
  The answer is D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$.

Choices:
  A: 0 and 2
  B: 0 and 4
  C: -4 and 4
  D: 4
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can start by cross-multiplying the equation to get rid of the fractions.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except when the denominator $x-3$ is equal to zero.
  Therefore, $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
  We can simplify the equation to get:

  $$2(x-3)(x)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2(x-3)(x-x+3)=0$$
  $$2(x-3)(3)=0$$
  $$x-3=0 \text{ or } x=3$$

Question: $$\begin{aligned}& k x-3 y=4 \\& 4 x-5 y=7\end{aligned}$$In the system of equations above, $k$ is a constant and $x$ and $y$ are variables. For what value of $k$ will the system of equations have no solution?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{12}{5}$
  B: $\frac{16}{7}$
  C: $-\frac{16}{7}$
  D: $-\frac{12}{5}$
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
  Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$.
  Then, subtract the second equation from the first equation.
  This will eliminate $x$ and we will get an equation in terms of $y$.
  If the coefficient of $y$ is the same in both equations, then the system will have no solution.
  Let's solve the system of equations for $y$.
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & 4kx-12y=16 \\
  & 4x-5y=7 \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & k(4x-5y)=4x-5y-7 \\
  & 4kx-5ky=4x-5y-7 \\
  & 4kx-12y-5ky=16 \\
  & (4k-5k)x-12y=16 \\
  & (4k-5k)x=12y+16 \\
  & -x=\frac{12}{4k-5}y+\frac{16}{4k-5} \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  The coefficient of $y$ is $\frac{12}{4k-5}$.
  For the system to have no solution, the coefficient of $y$ must be the same in both equations.
  Therefore, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $\frac{12}{4k-5}=-\frac{3}{5}$.
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & \frac{12}{4k-5}=-\frac{3}{5} \\
  & 12=-\frac{3}{5}(4k-5) \\
  & 12=-\frac{12}{5}k+\frac{15}{5} \\
  & -\frac{12}{5}k=-\frac{3}{5} \\
  & k=\frac{3}{12/5} \\
  & k=\frac{5}{4} \\

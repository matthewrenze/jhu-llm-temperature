Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. 

Let's find out how many employees take at least one vacation: 
75 (winter) + x (summer only) + 40 (both) = 100 - 20 (neither)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
x = 5

So, 80 employees take at least one vacation (75 winter + 5 summer only). 

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation:
x (summer only) - 40 (both) = y (summer only, not winter)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
y = x - 40
y = 5 - 40
y = -35

Since we can't have a negative number of employees, the answer must be 0. Therefore, 

Action: Answer("A")

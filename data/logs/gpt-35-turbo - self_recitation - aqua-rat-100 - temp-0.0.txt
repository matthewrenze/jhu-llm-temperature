Question: A rectangular solid, 3 x 4 x 15, is inscribed in a sphere, so that all eight of its vertices are on the sphere. What is the diameter of the sphere?
Choices:
  A:  13.3542
  B:  15.8113
  C:  18.3451
  D:  19.5667
  E:  20.8888
Response 0:
Knowledge:
  A rectangular solid has 8 vertices.
  The diameter of a sphere is twice the radius of the sphere.
  The radius of the sphere is the distance from the center of the sphere to any point on the sphere.
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid is the diameter of the sphere.
  The longest diagonal of a rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs of length a and b and hypotenuse of length c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the three pairs of points that define the rectangular solid.
  The length of the rectangular solid is 15, the width is 4, and the height is 3.
Action: 
  The longest diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem to the three pairs of points that define the rectangular solid:
  - The diagonal from (0,0,0) to (15,4,3) has length sqrt(15^2 + 4^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(290).
  - The diagonal from (0,0,0) to (15,4,-3) has length sqrt(15^2 + 4^2 + (-3)^2) = sqrt(290).
  - The diagonal from (0,0,0) to (15,-4,3) has length sqrt(15^2 + (-4)^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(290).
  Therefore, the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid is sqrt(290).
  The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius of the sphere, which is half the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  So, the diameter of the sphere is 2 * sqrt(290) / 2 = sqrt(290).
  Rounding to four decimal places, the answer is A: 13.3542.

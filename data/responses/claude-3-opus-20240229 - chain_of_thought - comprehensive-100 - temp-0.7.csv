1) Let the height of the room be $h$ and the length and breadth of the room be $l$ and $b$ respectively.
2) Given that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, we can write:
   $\frac{h}{\frac{l+b}{2}} = \frac{2}{5}$
3) This means:
   $h = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{l+b}{2} = \frac{l+b}{5}$
4) The area of the walls is $(2l+2b)h$. Subtracting the area for doors and windows, the area to be papered is:
   $(2l+2b)h - 15$
5) The cost of papering is Rs.2 per meter and the width of the paper is 50cm or 0.5m. So, the length of paper required is:
   $\frac{(2l+2b)h - 15}{0.5} = 2((2l+2b)h - 15)$
6) The total cost is Rs.260. So:
   $2((2l+2b)h - 15) \times 2 = 260$
7) Simplifying:
   $(2l+2b)h - 15 = 65$
8) Substituting $h = \frac{l+b}{5}$:
   $(2l+2b)\frac{l+b}{5} - 15 = 65$
   $\frac{2(l+b)^2}{5} - 15 = 65$
   $2(l+b)^2 = 400$
   $(l+b)^2 = 200$
   $l+b = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$
9) Therefore, the height of the room is:
   $h = \frac{l+b}{5} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{5} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.8$
10) The closest option to 2.8 is 2.6m.

claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,1,1,"Okay, let's approach this step by step:
1. Understand the given information:
   * The height to semi-perimeter ratio of the room is 2:5.
   * The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
   * The paper is 50cm (0.5m) wide and costs Rs.2 per meter.
   * An area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows.
2. Find the area of the walls covered by the paper:
   * Total cost = Rs.2 per meter × Length of paper used
   * Rs.260 = Rs.2 × Length of paper used
   * Length of paper used = 260 ÷ 2 = 130 meters
   * Area covered by paper = Length of paper × Width of paper
   * Area covered by paper = 130m × 0.5m = 65 sq.m
3. Find the total area of the walls:
   * Total area of walls = Area covered by paper + Area allowed for doors and windows
   * Total area of walls = 65 sq.m + 15 sq.m = 80 sq.m
4. Let the height of the room be 'h' and the perimeter of the room be 'p'.
   * Given, height : semi-perimeter = 2 : 5
   * h : (p/2) = 2 : 5
   * h = (2/5) × (p/2) = p/5
5. Express the total area of the walls in terms of 'p' and 'h':
   * Total area of walls = p × h
   * 80 = p × (p/5)
   * 80 = p^2/5
   * p^2 = 400
   * p = 20 meters
6. Calculate the height of the room:
   * h = p/5 = 20/5 = 4 meters

claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,1,2,"Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's denote the height of the room as h and the length and width as l and w respectively.
2) The semi-perimeter of the room is (l + w). Given the ratio, we can write:
   
   h : (l + w) = 2 : 5
   
   This means, h = (2/5) * (l + w)
3) The area of the walls is 2h(l + w). But we need to subtract the area for doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m.
   
   So, the actual area to be papered = 2h(l + w) - 15
4) The cost of papering is Rs.260. The paper is 50cm (0.5m) wide and costs Rs.2 per meter.
   
   So, the length of paper required = Area to be papered / Width of paper
                                    = (2h(l + w) - 15) / 0.5
   And the cost = Length of paper * Cost per meter
                = ((2h(l + w) - 15) / 0.5) * 2
                = 4h(l + w) - 30
   
   We're told this cost is Rs.260. So,
   4h(l + w) - 30 = 260
   4h(l + w) = 290
   h(l + w) = 72.5
5) But from step 2, we know that h = (2/5) * (l + w)
   Substituting this in the equation from step 4:
   (2/5) * (l + w) * (l + w) = 72.5
   (2/5) * (l + w)^2 = 72.5
   (l + w)^2 = 72.5 * (5/2) = 181.25
   l + w = √181.25 = 13.46
6) Now, going back to the ratio from step 2:
   h : (l + w) = 2 : 5
   h : 13.46 = 2 : 5
   h = (2/5) * 13.46 = 5.384
7) Therefore, the height of the room is approximately 5.384 meters.
Among the given options, 4.4m (option E) is the closest to this value.

1) Let the height of the room be $h$ meters and the length and width be $l$ and $w$ meters respectively.
2) Given that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, we can write:
   $\frac{h}{\frac{l+w}{2}} = \frac{2}{5}$
3) This implies: $h = \frac{2}{5} \times \frac{l+w}{2} = \frac{l+w}{5}$
4) The area of the walls is $(2l+2w)h$ sq.m. But we need to subtract the area for doors and windows, which is 15 sq.m.
   So, the actual area to be papered is $(2l+2w)h - 15$ sq.m.
5) The cost of papering is Rs.2 per meter length of the 50cm wide paper. This means the cost is Rs.4 per sq.m of the wall.
6) So, $(2l+2w)h - 15 = \frac{260}{4} = 65$
7) Substituting $h = \frac{l+w}{5}$ from step 3:
   $(2l+2w)(\frac{l+w}{5}) - 15 = 65$
   $\frac{2(l+w)^2}{5} - 15 = 65$
   $2(l+w)^2 = 400$
   $(l+w)^2 = 200$
   $l+w = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}$
8) From step 3, $h = \frac{l+w}{5} = \frac{10\sqrt{2}}{5} = 2\sqrt{2}$
9) $2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828$ meters, which is closest to 2.6m among the given choices.

claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,1,4,"Okay, let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's denote the height of the room as $h$ and the semi-perimeter as $s$. We are told that:
   $h : s = 2 : 5$
   This means $\frac{h}{s} = \frac{2}{5}$, or $h = \frac{2s}{5}$
2) Now, the total area of the walls is the perimeter times the height. But we need to subtract the area of doors and windows. So:
   Total wallpaper area = $2s \times h - 15$
3) We are told that the total cost of wallpaper is Rs.260, and the cost is Rs.2 per meter. So the total length of wallpaper used is:
   $260 \div 2 = 130$ meters
4) The width of the wallpaper is 50cm, or 0.5m. So the total area of wallpaper used is:
   $130 \times 0.5 = 65$ sq.m
5) Equating this to the total wallpaper area:
   $2s \times \frac{2s}{5} - 15 = 65$
   Simplifying: $\frac{4s^2}{5} - 15 = 65$
   $\frac{4s^2}{5} = 80$
   $s^2 = 100$
   $s = 10$
6) Since $h = \frac{2s}{5}$, we have:
   $h = \frac{2 \times 10}{5} = 4$

   * An area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows.
2. Find the area of the walls that need to be papered:
   * Paper cost = Rs.2 per meter
   * Total cost = Rs.260
   * Length of paper needed = 260 ÷ 2 = 130 meters
   * Width of paper = 50cm = 0.5m
   * Area of paper = Length × Width = 130 × 0.5 = 65 sq.m

claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,1,6,"Let's approach this step-by-step:
1) Let's denote the height of the room as h and the semi-perimeter as s.
2) We are given that h : s = 2 : 5. This means:
   
   h/s = 2/5
   
   h = (2/5) * s
3) Now, let's find the semi-perimeter. We know that the total area of the walls is the area covered by the paper plus the area of the doors and windows.
   Total wall area = Area covered by paper + Area of doors and windows
4) The area covered by paper can be found by dividing the cost of the paper by the cost per unit area.
   Area covered by paper = Total cost / Cost per unit area
                         = Rs.260 / (Rs.2 per meter * 0.5m width)
                         = 260 / 1 = 260 sq.m
5) Therefore, 
   
   Total wall area = 260 sq.m + 15 sq.m = 275 sq.m
6) The total wall area is also equal to the semi-perimeter multiplied by the height. So:
   275 = s * h
      = s * (2/5) * s  (substituting h from step 2)
      = (2/5) * s^2
   Solving for s:
   
   s^2 = 275 / (2/5) = 275 * (5/2) = 687.5
   
   s = sqrt(687.5) = 26.22 meters
7) Now that we have the semi-perimeter, we can find the height:
   h = (2/5) * s = (2/5) * 26.22 = 10.488 meters
8) The closest answer to 10.488 meters is 4.2 meters.

   - Let x be the total deer population.
   - Number of tagged deer in the entire population = 300 (from 2001)
   - 300 = 4% of x (as the sample is representative of the entire population)
5. Solve the equation:
   - 300 = 0.04x
   - x = 300 / 0.04
   - x = 7500
Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is estimated to be 7500.

2. In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random. Out of these 500, 20 had tags from the previous year.
3. The question states that the percent of deer with tags in the sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population with tags.
4. In the sample of 500 deer, the percentage of tagged deer is:
   20/500 = 4%
5. If this 4% is representative of the total population, then:
   300/x = 4/100 (where x is the total deer population)

1) Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'x' and the number of brass coins as 'y'.
2) We know that for each copper coin, the diver gets 20 cents (or $0.20), and for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents (or $0.25).
3) After one dive, her total earnings are $3.40. We can express this as an equation:
   0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40
4) Now, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins. In other words, we need to minimize 'x'.
5) To minimize 'x', we should assume that the diver brought as many brass coins as possible.
6) $3.40 is equal to 340 cents. The maximum number of brass coins that the diver could have brought is 340 ÷ 25 = 13 with a remainder of 15 cents.
7) These remaining 15 cents must be from copper coins. Since each copper coin is worth 20 cents, the minimum number of copper coins is 15 ÷ 20 = 0 with a remainder of 15 cents.
8) However, we can't have a fractional number of coins. So, the diver must have brought at least 1 copper coin to account for the remaining 15 cents.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver brought is 1.

3. We can set up an equation:

   - The closest multiple of 0.25 below 3.40 is 3.25 (13 * 0.25 = 3.25).
6. The difference between 3.40 and 3.25 is 0.15, which must be made up by copper coins.

3) Now, we need to find what percentage increase on $70 would bring the price back to $100.
4) The increase needed is: $100 - $70 = $30
5) To calculate the percentage increase:
   Percentage increase = (Increase Amount / Original Amount) × 100
                       = ($30 / $70) × 100

A) The argument does seem to separate humanity from nature by suggesting human activities led to animal extinctions. However, this statement doesn't directly weaken the main point that early human activities contributed to the extinction of certain large mammals in North America.
B) This statement actually strengthens the argument by suggesting human arrival could have caused additional animal extinctions beyond those mentioned. It doesn't make the argument more vulnerable.
C) The significance of the extinctions to early humans is not directly relevant to whether human activities contributed to those extinctions. The argument's main point is not significantly weakened by this statement.
D) This statement provides an alternative explanation that could weaken the argument. If the same climate change that allowed humans to enter North America also independently caused the large mammal extinctions, then the argument that human activities were responsible becomes more vulnerable.

A: This statement does not directly address Li Ming's argument that unemployed people cannot increase consumption when prices are low. It discusses what happens after the economy improves.
B: This statement suggests that consumer confidence remains high even during economic downturns. However, it does not directly address whether unemployed people can increase consumption when prices are low.
C: This statement agrees with Li Ming's argument that unemployed people can only afford necessities during economic downturns. It does not weaken Li Ming's rebuttal.
D: This statement directly challenges Li Ming's argument. It suggests that when prices fall to the lowest point, even unemployed people will have some savings that they can use for consumption.

   - In the average family budget, the proportion of the cost of buying commercial housing remained unchanged.
   - Therefore, the average family budget must have increased by 25%.
3. For the conclusion to be true (average family budget increased by 25%), there must be an assumption about the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household on average.
4. If the average area of new commercial housing purchased by each household changed, it would affect the total cost of buying commercial housing for each family, even if the price per square meter increased by 25%.

1. S is performed fourth.
2. O must be performed either first or fifth. Since S is fourth, O must be first.
3. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. 
4. P is performed at some time before S. So P must be second or third.
Looking at the answer choices, only C and D have O first. 
In C, R is third. This would mean T has to be second (immediately before F or immediately after R). But P has to be before S, so this doesn't work.
In D, P is second and T is third. This satisfies the conditions:
- O is first
- P is before S
- T is immediately before F (which would be performed after S)

3. T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. There are two possible cases:

3. Greene's watercolor is in the upper position of the same wall as Franz's oil (wall 3). So Greene's oil must be on either wall 1, 2, or 4.
4. No wall can have only one student's work. Wall 2 has Isaacs's watercolor, so it must also have either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil or watercolor. 
5. Similarly, wall 4 has Isaacs's oil, so it must also have either Greene's oil or Hidalgo's oil or watercolor.
6. This leaves wall 1. It can't have Franz (because of the rule about Franz and Isaacs), and it can't have Isaacs. So it must have both of Hidalgo's paintings, or both of Greene's paintings, or one painting from each.

3. F and M are placed on the same shelf. Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
4. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L could be on the bottom shelf, but O cannot be.
5. G and H are not mentioned in the conditions, so they could be on any shelf, including the bottom shelf.
Now, let's look at the choices:
A: F, M - This could be correct, but there must be at least two more books on the bottom shelf.
B: F, H, M - This could be correct, as F and M are on the bottom shelf, and H could be as well.

2. The psychologist then argues that despite societal changes, human psychology is still primarily driven by personal interaction.
3. Based on these premises, the psychologist concludes that the social function of positively reinforcing beneficial behaviors can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude.
Now, let's look at the role of the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously:
- It is not used as an illustration (A) because it is a key premise, not an example.
- It is not countering a consideration that might undermine the conclusion (B).
- It is not indirectly supporting a claim that in turn supports the conclusion (C).
- It is not identifying the social benefit the argument is concerned with (D).

1. The physician's argument is that the experiment shows magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. This is based on the observation that most patients in the magnet group reported significant pain reduction, while few in the untreated group did.
2. To counter this argument, we need to find a fact that would undermine the conclusion that the magnets caused the pain reduction.
3. Choice A suggests that merely knowing a treatment was applied can lead to improvement. This implies a placebo effect could explain the pain reduction in the magnet group, rather than the magnets themselves. This would be a strong counter to the physician's argument.
4. Choice B about most physicians' beliefs doesn't directly address the experiment's results or conclusion.
5. Choice C about the lack of experiments on other pain areas doesn't negate the results for back pain.
6. Choice D about some scientists' prior beliefs doesn't affect the validity of the experiment's results.
7. Choice E about variation in pain causes among the patients doesn't change the fact that the magnet group reported more improvement than the control group.

2. It does so by drawing an analogy to M tuberculosis. It says that even though less than 10% of people who harbor M tuberculosis get sick from it, no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal.
3. The argument implies that the same reasoning should apply to H pylori - just because less than 10% of people who harbor it get stomach ulcers, it shouldn't be considered a commensal.
4. To undermine this reasoning, we need to find a relevant difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis that would justify classifying one as a commensal but not the other.

A. The fact that both can be treated with antibiotics doesn't seem relevant to whether they're commensals or not.
B. The duration of the illnesses caused doesn't seem directly relevant either.
C. This is the most promising choice. If people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from it, while people who harbor H pylori do (as the argument itself mentions - ""it allegedly strengthens immune response""), then that would be a relevant difference that could justify classifying H pylori as a commensal but not M tuberculosis.

1. The passage discusses how the discovery of nuclear fission was not a smooth, direct process in response to the data collected. It points out that crucial evidence was overlooked for some time before the theoretical connection was made.
2. The author uses this example to illustrate a broader point about scientific progress. The key sentence is: ""Advances in scientific understanding often do not build directly or smoothly in response to the data that are amassed, and in retrospect, after a major revision of theory, it may seem strange that a crucial hypothesis was long overlooked.""
3. The author is not criticizing a traditional view or advocating a replacement (A). They are not judging the relative importance of theory and experimentation (C). They are not taking issue with the idea that scientists make slow, steady progress (D) - in fact, they are suggesting progress is often not slow and steady. And they are not discussing intellectual arrogance (E).
4. The best answer seems to be B - the author is using the discovery of nuclear fission to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress.

2. The author then provides an example of this with the discovery of nuclear fission. Despite increasing evidence, scientists did not recognize what they were witnessing.
3. The author explains that researchers were not receptive to the possibility of breaking atoms apart in the context of their experiments.
4. The author details the experiments and findings of various scientists, highlighting how the evidence was present but lacked the right conceptual link.
5. The author concludes by stating that once Meitner provided the crucial theoretical connection, it became clear that the relevant evidence had been present for some time.
The passage primarily focuses on illustrating how scientific progress can be erratic and how crucial insights can be overlooked despite the presence of relevant evidence. This aligns best with choice B.
The other choices are not as well supported by the passage:
- A: The author does not explicitly criticize a traditional view or advocate for a replacement.
- C: The author does not make a judgment about the relative importance of theory and experimentation.

1. The passage states that Schoenberg's music is disturbing ""not because it is incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting, but because it unflinchingly faces difficult truths.""
2. So, the disturbing aspect of Schoenberg's music is not due to its unfamiliarity or harshness, but because it confronts uncomfortable realities.
3. Looking at the choices:
   A) Vulgar humor doesn't necessarily face difficult truths.
   B) A comedian who shines a light on aspects of human nature that people prefer to ignore is directly analogous to how Schoenberg's music is described.
   C) Using material from other comedians doesn't relate to facing difficult truths.
   D) Expressing an extreme political philosophy is not the same as facing difficult truths about human nature.
   E) Unfamiliar humor is more analogous to the ""incoherent shrill, and ear-splitting"" aspect that the passage says is not the reason Schoenberg's music is disturbing.
4. Therefore, choice B, a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, is most analogous to how Schoenberg's music is described as disturbing.

3) Looking at the choices:
   A) Vulgar humor is disturbing because it's crude or offensive, not because it reveals difficult truths.
   B) A comedian who shines a light on aspects of human nature people would prefer to ignore is analogous to Schoenberg's music - it's disturbing because it confronts the audience with uncomfortable realities.
   C) Using material from other comedians isn't inherently disturbing.
   D) Expressing an extreme political philosophy could be disturbing, but more because it's controversial or offensive, not because it reveals difficult truths about human nature.

1. Tocqueville argues that the sexes have different roles based on their different natures. He believes ""nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties"". So he thinks one's sex should define one's position to some degree.
2. In contrast, Mill argues against ""an arbitrary limit"" based on sex or class that prevents individuals from exerting their faculties as they choose. He believes ""each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,—by trial"". So he thinks individual ability, not sex, should determine position. 
3. The other options don't accurately capture the key differences in their views:
   - Neither focuses on economic class as the main determinant.

Action: Answer(""A"")
"
claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,51,8,"To determine the correct answer, I'll analyze the key points made by each author regarding an individual's proper position in society.
Tocqueville's view:
- Nature has appointed wide differences between man and woman, giving them distinct faculties and roles.
- Improvement consists of each sex fulfilling their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
- The duties of man and woman should be carefully divided so society functions better.
Mill's view:
- All individuals should have equal rights and opportunities, not be limited by the ""old rule"" of male dominion.
- Every occupation should be open to all without favor or discouragement.
- Individuals should be free to prove their capacities through trial, and employments should go to those proven most capable, regardless of sex.
- Arbitrary limits based on sex are an injustice to the individual and a detriment to society.
Comparing the views:
- Tocqueville believes sex should define an individual's role, while Mill believes individual ability should be the determining factor, not sex.
- The other choices mention economic class, temperament, and individual vs. societal benefit, but these are not the key points of contrast between the two passages.
Therefore, choice A best captures the essential difference in how the two authors conceive of an individual's proper position in society.
Action: Answer(""A"")
"
claude-3-opus-20240229,chain_of_thought,comprehensive-100,0.7,51,9,"Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:
1. Tocqueville argues that the sexes should have distinct roles based on their different natures. He says ""nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties"". This suggests he believes an individual's sex should define their position to some degree.
2. In contrast, Mill argues that ""each individual will prove his or her capacities, in the only way in which capacities can be proved,-by trial"". He believes occupations should be open to all regardless of sex, and an individual's abilities demonstrated through free choice should determine their position.
3. Tocqueville does mention what's best for society - ""in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on"" - but this seems a secondary justification for sex-based roles, not the primary basis for determining an individual's position as the question suggests. 
4. Mill does not appear to argue that individual preference alone should determine position, but rather that abilities proven through open competition should.
5. The other options - economic class and temperament - are not clearly referenced by either author as the key determinant of individual position.
Therefore, the answer that best summarizes the key difference in their views is:

A. The passage does not discuss genetic variations between the finches that used the novel technique and those that did not.
B. The passage does not mention the researchers altering the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.
C. The novel technique does take place inside the crevice, which would make it difficult for other finches to observe and learn socially. This supports the idea that the finches learned the technique individually.
D. The artificial crevices differed from natural crevices, so it's likely that there isn't a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development and transmission of this specific technique. This also supports the idea of individual learning.

1. Parsons initially believed that government could help alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed. However, after studying governments more closely, she concluded this was a mistake.
2. She came to understand that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent and protest against the few who rule. Progress only happens when the minority can no longer be silenced by punishment or death.
3. She believes political parties make promises to gain power, but once in power, their main goals are to remain in power and crush opposition, not to bring about change.
4. She is appalled at the thought of a political party controlling all aspects of life and believes people in the 20th century should not hand over management of social and industrial affairs to any political party.
5. She believes in Anarchism because it provides the conditions for the fullest development of individuals, which is not possible under government restrictions.
Based on these points, Parsons seems to believe that positive social change happens when vocal individuals and minorities compel governments to address their concerns, not when masses are well-versed in history, parties commit to reform, or there are fewer parties.

- Progress only happens when protesting minorities can no longer be silenced by the government.
- Political parties, once in power, will prioritize maintaining control rather than fulfilling their promises of reform.

1. The passage is about a woman named Lady Carlotta who gets off a train at a small station.
2. She helps a horse struggling with a heavy load, causing her to miss her train. 
3. She is then mistaken for a governess named Miss Hope by a Mrs. Quabarl, who has come to meet Miss Hope.
4. Rather than correcting Mrs. Quabarl, Lady Carlotta goes along with the mistaken identity and pretends to be the governess.
5. In the car ride to Mrs. Quabarl's house, Lady Carlotta learns about the children she is supposed to teach. 
6. When Mrs. Quabarl mentions expecting the governess to speak French at mealtimes, Lady Carlotta says she will speak French and Russian, surprising Mrs. Quabarl.
7. Lady Carlotta's confident demeanor and unexpected resistance unsettle Mrs. Quabarl, who is used to being in control.
The key points are that Lady Carlotta is mistaken for someone else (a governess), and she chooses to go along with this mistaken identity rather than correcting it. This matches best with choice B.
The other choices don't fit as well:
- A: The passage doesn't mention Lady Carlotta weighing job aspects. 
- C: There's no indication Lady Carlotta is seeking revenge.
- D: While Lady Carlotta does unsettle Mrs. Quabarl, it's not clear she actively dislikes her.
Therefore, the best summary is B: A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.

5) This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula:
   $x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
   Here, $a=1$, $b=-1$, and $c=-3$
6) Plugging in these values:
   $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1-4(1)(-3)}}{2(1)}$
   $x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{13}}{2}$
7) This gives us two solutions:
   $x_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$ and $x_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}$
8) However, remember that we started by cross-multiplying. This is only valid if the denominator is not zero. 
   In the original equation, the denominator is $x-3$. So $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
9) Checking our solutions:
   For $x_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{13}}{2}$, $x_1 - 3 = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \neq 0$, so this is a valid solution.
   For $x_2 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{13}}{2}$, $x_2 - 3 = \frac{-5 - \sqrt{13}}{2} \neq 0$, so this is also a valid solution.
10) Looking at the answer choices, the only one that includes both of these solutions is D: 4.
Therefore, the answer is D: 4.

1) First, let's multiply both sides of the equation by $(x-3)$ to get rid of the fraction on the left side:
   $x = \frac{2x}{2}(x-3)$
2) Simplify the right side:
   $x = x(x-3)$
3) Expand the right side:
   $x = x^2 - 3x$
4) Subtract $x$ from both sides:
   $0 = x^2 - 4x$
5) Factor the right side:
   $0 = x(x - 4)$
6) Use the zero product property. If the product of two factors is zero, then one of the factors must be zero:
   Either $x = 0$ or $x - 4 = 0$
7) Solve the second equation:
   $x - 4 = 0$
   $x = 4$
8) Therefore, the possible values of $x$ are 0 and 4.

   So the equation becomes: $\frac{x}{x-3} = x$
2) Now, let's cross-multiply. This gives us:

3) Simplifying the right side:

4) Subtracting $x^2$ from both sides:
   $0 = -3x$
5) Dividing both sides by -3:
   $x = 0$
6) However, we also need to consider the domain of the original function. The denominator cannot be zero, so:

1) We need to find a function that models the total number of businesses (y) in the DBA after x years.
2) We know that:
   - The DBA plans to increase its membership by n businesses per year.
   - There were b businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year.
3) After 1 year, the total number of businesses will be the initial number (b) plus the increase (n). So, y = b + n when x = 1.
4) After 2 years, the total will be the initial number (b) plus twice the yearly increase (2n). So, y = b + 2n when x = 2.
5) We can generalize this: after x years, the total will be the initial number (b) plus x times the yearly increase (xn). So, y = b + xn.

   39 + 125 = 164
5) So, the probability we're looking for is:
   (Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream) / (Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream)
   = 79 / 164
Therefore, the correct answer is C: $\frac{79}{164}$

1. First, we need to understand the difference between a physical property and a chemical property:
   - A physical property is a characteristic that can be observed or measured without changing the composition of the substance.
   - A chemical property is a characteristic that describes how a substance changes into a different substance.
2. We also need to know the difference between a physical change and a chemical change:
   - A physical change does not alter the chemical composition of the substance. The original substance remains the same.
   - A chemical change results in the formation of one or more new substances.
3. Now, let's consider the freezing of water:
   - When water freezes, it changes from a liquid state to a solid state (ice).
   - However, the chemical composition of water (H2O) does not change when it freezes. The water molecules remain as H2O in both liquid and solid states.

1) An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing rock, like gravel or sand, that readily transmits water to wells and springs.
2) As water percolates down from the surface through soil and rock layers, the soil and rock act as natural filters. They trap sediments and other particles, including many pollutants and contaminants.
3) The deeper the aquifer, the more filtering the water has undergone as it has passed through more layers of rock and soil. 
4) Aquifers are not directly connected to the ocean or to the mixing of fresh and salt water. They are also not necessarily close to the surface.
5) While aquifers can be recharged by precipitation, the cleanliness of the water is more due to the filtering process as the water moves through rock and soil layers.
Therefore, the best answer is D: because pollutants are filtered by rock and soil deep within Earth. The natural filtration through rock and soil layers is what makes aquifer water often cleaner than surface water sources.

2. The eggs need a specific environment to develop properly:
   - They require a certain temperature range.
   - They need to be protected from predators.
   - They need to be in a stable environment, not exposed to water or shifting sands.
3. Analyzing the choices:
   A: Eggs should not be covered with water as they need to breathe air.
   B: The eggs contain their own nutrients; the sand does not provide nutrients.
   C: Burying the eggs hides them from potential predators on the beach.
   D: Burying the eggs protects them from the shifting sands on the beach.
4. While both C and D are plausible, the primary reason turtles bury their eggs is to protect them from predators. The sand also provides a stable environment, but this is a secondary benefit.

   - The sun could overheat and damage the eggs if they are not insulated.
   - The eggs need a stable environment for proper development.
4. Burying eggs in the sand:
   - Hides them from predators.
   - Provides insulation from the sun and temperature fluctuations.
   - Does not cover them with water, as that would drown the eggs.

  Let the height of the room be 2x meters and its semi-perimeter be 5x meters.
  Then, the area of the walls = 2x * 5x = 10x^2 sq.m.
  The area of the paper required = (10x^2 - 15) sq.m.
  The width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m.
  The length of the paper required = (10x^2 - 15)/0.5 = 20x^2 - 30 m.

  The number of brass coins needed to get 340 cents is 340/25 = 13.6.
  Since the number of coins must be an integer, we round up to 14.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins is 340 - 14*25 = 40.
  The answer is A: 4.

  The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  The passage provides two alternative explanations for the origin of the Gua name: the orientation theory and the sense of meaning theory.
  The orientation theory states that the name of a hexagram is based on its orientation. For example, the Qian gua is named after the south, and the Kun gua is named after the north.
  The sense of meaning theory states that the name of a hexagram is based on its meaning. For example, the Qian gua is named after the sky, and the Kun gua is named after the earth.

  The statement that most seriously shakes the traditional view is the statement that the name of a hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.

  The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  The passage provides two alternative explanations for the origin of the Gua name: the orientation theory and the sense of meaning theory.
  The orientation theory states that the name of a hexagram is based on its orientation. For example, the Qian gua is named after the south, and the Kun gua is named after the north.
  The sense of meaning theory states that the name of a hexagram is based on its meaning. For example, the Qian gua is named after the sky, and the Kun gua is named after the earth.
  The passage argues that neither the orientation theory nor the sense of meaning theory can fully explain the origin of the Gua name. Only by combining the two theories can we give a complete explanation.

**Zhang Qiang:**
* **Premise:** Sluggish economy leads to unemployment.
* **Result:** Reduced living expenses worsen the economy.
* **Result:** Continued deterioration leads to lowest prices.
* **Result:** Low prices stimulate increased consumption.
* **Result:** Increased consumption improves the economy.
**Li Ming:**
* **Counterargument:** Unemployed people cannot increase consumption.
* **Counterargument:** They lack money for non-essential goods.
* **Conclusion:** Falling prices won't improve the economy.
## Analyzing the Choices:
**A:** This supports Zhang Qiang by suggesting increased hiring and delayed purchases, boosting consumption.
**B:** This supports Zhang Qiang by suggesting consumer optimism despite economic decline, potentially driving consumption.
**C:** This weakens Li Ming by stating that even unemployed people need necessities, creating some level of consumption.
**D:** This weakens Li Ming by suggesting that even unemployed people can save during economic decline and spend when prices are low.
## Choosing the Best Answer:
Both options C and D weaken Li Ming's argument by demonstrating that even unemployed individuals contribute to consumption. However, option D is stronger because it specifically addresses Li Ming's claim about the lack of money for non-essential goods. By stating that unemployed people can save and spend when prices are low, option D directly counters Li Ming's point about the limitations of consumption during economic decline.

  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, another student's painting is displayed on wall 2.
  This student's painting cannot be Franz's oil or Greene's watercolor, as these are already accounted for.
  Therefore, this student's painting must be either Hidalgo's oil or Hidalgo's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil would be displayed on wall 2, which would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.

  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.

  The principle stated by the university president is that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Option A is incorrect because it denies a grant application for work on a theoretical problem that has no relation to practical concerns.
  Option B is incorrect because it funds a research project in astrophysics that is not related to practical problems.
  Option C is incorrect because it funds a research position that does not involve teaching or research.
  Option D is incorrect because it does not fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that could potentially yield insights into practical problems.
  Option E is correct because it funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.

  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  The strongest counter to this argument would be to show that the improvement in the first group could be explained by something other than the magnetic fields.
  Choice A provides the strongest counter-argument because it suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to the placebo effect, which is the phenomenon where a patient's condition improves simply because they believe they are receiving treatment.
  The other choices are not as strong counter-arguments because they do not provide an alternative explanation for the improvement in the first group.
  Choice B is not a strong counter-argument because it is simply an opinion, not evidence.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  It argues that the modular theory of mind is not valid because mental activity is not decomposable into independent modules.
  It also argues that the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is misleading because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions.
  The passage concludes by stating that the modular theory of mind is attractive because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  The statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  This statement is supported by the following passage: ""The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. The reasoning, seemingly plausible, is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.""
  The passage goes on to say that this method is misleading because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control and on-task conditions. However, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

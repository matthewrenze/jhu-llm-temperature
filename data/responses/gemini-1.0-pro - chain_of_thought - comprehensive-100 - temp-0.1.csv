  If this percent is representative of the total deer population, then 4% of the total deer population has tags.
  We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001.
  Therefore, 4% of the total deer population is equal to 300 deer.
  We can set up the equation 0.04 * total deer population = 300.
  Solving for the total deer population, we get total deer population = 300 / 0.04 = 7500.

  The principle that most helps to justify this reasoning is that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

  The reasoning above is that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The question asks which of the answer choices most weakens this reasoning.
  Answer choice A weakens the reasoning because it states that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch. This suggests that the effect of watching television on people's perception of risk is not as significant as the study claims.
  Answer choice B weakens the reasoning because it states that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in areas that are prone to natural disasters. This suggests that the people who are most likely to be affected by the study's findings are not the people who are most likely to be exposed to natural disasters.
  Answer choice C weakens the reasoning because it states that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This suggests that the effect of watching television on people's perception of risk is not as significant as the study claims.
  Answer choice D weakens the reasoning because it states that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This suggests that the effect of watching television on people's perception of risk is not as significant as the study claims.
  Answer choice E weakens the reasoning because it states that people who live in areas that are prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch an above-average amount of television.

  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  The strongest counter to this argument would be to show that the improvement in the first group could be due to something other than the magnetic fields.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  The author argues that the modular theory of mind is not valid and that brain scans do not provide accurate pictures of mental activity.
  The author also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The author argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that it gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The author concludes that the modular theory of mind is ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  The passage does not support the statement that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage does not support the statement that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  The passage does support the statement that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  The passage does not support the statement that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage does not support the statement that when a brain scan subject experiences anger, the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as ""lit up"" with metabolic activity.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
  The author argues that the modular theory of mind is not valid and that brain scans do not provide accurate pictures of mental activity.
  The author also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI).
  The author argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that it gives a false impression of neat functional localization.
  The author concludes that the modular theory of mind is ultimately attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  The passage does not support the statement that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage does not support the statement that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  The passage does support the statement that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  The passage does not support the statement that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage does not support the statement that when a brain scan subject experiences anger, the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as ""lit up"" with metabolic activity.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

  The passage describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances are not essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The answer should be a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option A is not analogous because generators are not essential for the proper functioning of hospitals.
  Option B is not analogous because features such as paint and taillights are not essential for the proper functioning of automobiles.

  This is because both Schoenberg's music and the comedian's humor are disturbing because they confront the audience with uncomfortable truths.
  The other answer choices are not as analogous.
  A comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it does not confront the audience with difficult truths.
  A comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore is disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it confronts the audience with uncomfortable truths.
  A comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it does not confront the audience with difficult truths.
  A comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it does not confront the audience with difficult truths.
  A comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it does not confront the audience with difficult truths.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

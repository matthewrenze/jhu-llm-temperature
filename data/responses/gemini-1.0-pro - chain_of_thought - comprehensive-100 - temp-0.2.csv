  Let the height of the room be 2x meters and the semi-perimeter be 5x meters.
  Then, the area of the walls = 2x * 5x = 10x^2 sq.m.
  The area of the paper required = 10x^2 - 15 sq.m.
  The width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m.
  The length of the paper required = (10x^2 - 15)/0.5 = 20x^2 - 30 m.
  The cost of the paper = Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the total cost of the paper = Rs.2(20x^2 - 30) = Rs.40x^2 - 60.
  Given that the total cost of the paper = Rs.260.

  The argument states that the penalty for the pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that the evidence is not strong enough to be certain of the identity of the polluter.

  The passage describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances are not essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The answer should describe a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option A describes the relationship between hospitals and generators. Generators are not essential for the proper functioning of hospitals, but they can provide electricity in case the usual source of power is unavailable. This is analogous to the relationship between plants and their secondary substances.
  Option B describes the relationship between automobiles and their features. Features such as paint and taillights are not essential for automobiles to run, but they give automobiles their distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety. This is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option C describes the relationship between clothing factories and their components. Mechanical components are required for the operation of clothing factories, while electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components. This is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option D describes the relationship between trains and their braking systems. Braking systems are necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop. This is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option E describes the relationship between computers and word processing programs. Word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors. This is not analogous to the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.

  The passage describes the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Primary substances are essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants.
  Secondary substances are not essential for the growth and proper functioning of plants, but they give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The answer should describe a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Option A describes the relationship between hospitals and generators. Generators are not essential for the proper functioning of hospitals, but they can provide electricity in case the usual source of power is unavailable. This is analogous to the relationship between plants and their secondary substances.

  The passage states that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles.
  The first style is described as late-Romantic, with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style is described as having unstable harmonies that no longer have a tonal basis.
  The third style is described as using the 12-tone technique to bring order to nontonal music.
  The passage suggests that the second style is a natural progression from the first, as Schoenberg pushed the unstable harmonies of the first style to their limit.
  However, the passage also suggests that the third style is an inexplicable departure from the second, as it introduces a new system of order that is not based on traditional tonal harmony.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that the second style represents an inexplicable departure from the first, but the third style represents a natural progression from the second.

  Multiply both sides of the equation by $(x-3)(2)$ to get rid of the fractions.
  This gives us $2x(x-3) = 4x(x-3)$.
  Expanding both sides, we get $2x^2 - 6x = 4x^2 - 12x$.

  We can simplify the expression by finding a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator.
  The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$.
  Multiplying the first fraction by $\frac{x+3}{x+3}$ and the second fraction by $\frac{x+2}{x+2}$, we get:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)} + \frac{x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)}$
  Combining the two fractions, we get:
  $\frac{x+3 + x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)} = \frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}$

  A transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) can be used to assess the uterus and ovaries for any structural abnormalities.
  Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows direct visualization of the inside of the uterus, which can help identify polyps, fibroids, or other uterine abnormalities.
  Endometrial biopsy can be used to evaluate the lining of the uterus for any abnormalities that may interfere with implantation or fetal development.
  Chromosomal abnormalities can be a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, so karyotyping of both partners may be indicated.
  Considering the information above, the most appropriate next investigation would be a combination of TVS and endometrial biopsy.

Thought: 
  Let the height of the room be 2x meters and its semi-perimeter be 5x meters.
  Then, 2x/5x = 2/5.
  Therefore, x = 2.5.
  The height of the room is 2x = 5 meters.
  The area of the walls is 2h(l + b) = 2 * 5(5x + 5x) = 50x sq.m.
  The area of the walls excluding doors and windows is 50x - 15 = 50 * 2.5 - 15 = 110 sq.m.
  The length of the paper required is 110/0.5 = 220 m.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.220 * 2 = Rs.440.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 3.9m.

  The argument claims that because 72% of consumers believe ""Hero"" dominates the market, it must be true that ""Hero"" dominates the market.
  This is a fallacy because correlation does not equal causation. Just because people believe something is true does not mean it is actually true.
  The argument is mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

  Of the above choices, only option E aligns with this principle. Research into the mathematical properties of folded structures has the potential to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease, which could lead to the development of new treatments or cures for diseases.
  The other options do not align with the principle because they either do not have the potential to solve practical problems or are not related to theoretical investigation.
  Therefore, the principle stated by the university president most helps to justify funding an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
  The answer is E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.

  The argument states that the penalty for the pollution is severe, and that this severity makes it difficult to impose the penalty unless one is very certain of the polluter's identity.
  Option A aligns with this reasoning, stating that the severity of the penalty necessitates greater certainty of guilt before imposing it.
  Option B focuses on the deterrent effect of penalties, which is not directly relevant to the argument's focus on the difficulty of imposing a severe penalty.

The passage does not support the statement that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
The passage does support the statement that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
The passage does not support the statement that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
The passage does not support the statement that when a brain scan subject experiences anger, the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as ""lit up"" with metabolic activity.
Therefore, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning of plants, while secondary substances are not.
  Electrical power is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals, while generators are used to provide electricity in case the usual source of power is unavailable.
  Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Mechanical components are required for the operation of clothing factories, while electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop, while such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors, while such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
  The relationship between primary substances and secondary substances is most similar to the relationship between mechanical components and electrical components in clothing factories.

  Electrical power is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals, while generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.
  Mechanical components are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Mechanical components are required for the operation of clothing factories, while electrical components supply the power needed to run the mechanical components, but they do not participate directly in the manufacturing process.
  Some type of braking system is necessary for trains to be able to decelerate and stop, while such systems comprise both friction components that directly contact the trains' wheels and pneumatic components that exert pressure on the friction components.
  Specially designed word processing programs are necessary for computers to be able to function as word processors, while such programs can be stored either in the computers' internal memory system or on external disks that are inserted temporarily into the computers.
  The relationship between primary substances and secondary substances is most similar to the relationship between electrical power and generators in hospitals.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Electrical power for the operation of devices such as lights and medical instruments is essential to the proper functioning of hospitals; generators are often used in hospitals to provide electricity in case their usual source of power is temporarily unavailable.

  The passage states that Schoenberg's music is disturbing because it ""unflinchingly faces difficult truths.""
  The answer choice that is most analogous to this is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.
  This is because both Schoenberg's music and the comedian's humor confront uncomfortable realities that people would rather avoid.
  The other answer choices are not as analogous.
  A: a comedian whose material relies heavily upon vulgar humor is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it does not confront difficult truths.
  C: a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it is not original or innovative.
  D: a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it is not about facing difficult truths.
  E: a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience is not disturbing in the same way as Schoenberg's music because it is not about confronting difficult truths.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore.

  The patient has a history of two second-trimester abortions, which suggests a possible underlying medical condition.
  Further investigation is needed to identify the cause of the recurrent pregnancy loss.
  A transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) can be used to assess the uterus and ovaries for any structural abnormalities.
  Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to visualize the inside of the uterus and identify any polyps, fibroids, or other abnormalities.
  An endometrial biopsy can be used to evaluate the lining of the uterus for any abnormalities that could interfere with implantation.
  Chromosomal abnormalities can be a cause of recurrent pregnancy loss, so karyotyping of both partners may be recommended.
  Therefore, the next investigation I would advise is a TVS.

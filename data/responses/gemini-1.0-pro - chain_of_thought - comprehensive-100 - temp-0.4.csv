  Let the height of the room be h meters and its semi-perimeter be 5x meters.
  Then, 2h = 5x => h = 5x/2.
  Area of the walls = 2h(5x) = 50x sq.m.
  Area of the paper required = 50x - 15 sq.m.
  Cost of papering = Rs.2(50x - 15)/1 = Rs.100x - 30.
  Given that the cost of papering is Rs.260.
  Therefore, 100x - 30 = 260 => x = 2.9.
  Hence, the height of the room = 5x/2 = 7.25 m.

**B:** This statement challenges the traditional view by suggesting that neither the orientation theory nor the meaning theory alone can fully explain the hexagram names. It implies that a more nuanced approach considering both aspects is necessary.
**C:** This statement acknowledges the diversity of explanations for the Gua names but ultimately links them back to the traditional framework of either fetching images or fetching meanings. It doesn't fundamentally challenge the traditional view.

  Li Ming argues that falling prices will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions because unemployed people will not have the money to buy goods.
  To weaken Li Ming's argument, we need to show that even unemployed people may have the money to buy goods when prices fall.
  Option D states that even during economic deterioration, unemployed people may have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.
  This directly contradicts Li Ming's claim that unemployed people will not have the money to buy goods.
  Therefore, option D best weakens Li Ming's rebuttal.

    B: keyboard player - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so he could perform the third solo.
    C: saxophonist - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, so he could perform the third solo.
    D: trumpeter - The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, so the trumpeter could perform the third solo.
    E: violinist - The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does, so the violinist cannot perform the third solo.

  The columnist's judgment is most likely based on the principle that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community.
  This principle is reflected in the columnist's statement that ""the extra money from water bills should be used to build a dam, which would benefit the entire community.""
  The other principles listed are not as relevant to the columnist's judgment.
  For example, the principle that customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used is not relevant because the columnist does not argue that the customers of the water utility do not know how the money will be used.
  The principle that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of is not relevant because the columnist does not argue that most of the utility's customers disapprove of the dam project.

  The physician's argument is that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain because most patients in the first group reported a significant reduction in pain.
  The strongest counter to this argument would be to show that the improvement in the first group could be explained by something other than the magnetic fields.
  Choice A provides the strongest counter-argument because it suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to the placebo effect, which is the phenomenon where a patient's condition improves simply because they believe they are receiving treatment.

  The studies suggest that highlighting a large company's competition with smaller brands can increase support for the smaller brands.
  If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, they might be more likely to see the smaller shops as a viable alternative.
  This could lead to customers choosing to shop at the smaller stores instead of the large chain, resulting in a loss of customers for the large store.
  Therefore, the most likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.
  The answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

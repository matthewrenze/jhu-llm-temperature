  Li Ming's rebuttal is that if people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
  To weaken Li Ming's rebuttal, we need to show that even if people are unemployed, they may still have the ability and willingness to increase their consumption.
  Option A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed. This option does not directly address Li Ming's rebuttal, as it focuses on the situation after the economy improves, not during the period of economic deterioration.
  Option B: Even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve. This option does not directly address Li Ming's rebuttal either, as it focuses on consumer beliefs, not on their actual ability to consume.
  Option C: Even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food. This option actually strengthens Li Ming's rebuttal, as it points out that even with limited resources, unemployed people will prioritize necessities over other goods.
  Option D: During the period of economic deterioration, even unemployed people will compress expenditures; when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption. This option directly addresses Li Ming's rebuttal by suggesting that even unemployed people may have some savings during the period of economic deterioration, which they can use to increase their consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.

Let's analyze each constraint to understand the limitations:
1. **Frost and Heideck must be assigned together:** This means they will be either both at Silva or both at Thorne.
2. **Lai and Mays, if assigned, must be at different ceremonies:** This implies they cannot be both at Silva or both at Thorne.
3. **Gonzalez at Silva implies Lai at Thorne:** If Gonzalez is at Silva, Lai must be at Thorne.
4. **Knutson not at Thorne implies Heideck and Mays at Thorne:** If Knutson is not at Thorne, both Heideck and Mays must be at Thorne.
## Analyzing the Choices:
Now, let's analyze each choice against the constraints:
**A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson:** 
* This violates constraint 2, as both Lai and Mays are at Silva.
**B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:**
* This satisfies all constraints. Frost and Heideck are together, Lai and Mays are not together, and Gonzalez at Silva implies Lai at Thorne.
**C: Gonzalez, Knutson:**
* This violates constraint 1, as Frost and Heideck are not together.
**D: Heideck, Lai:**
* This violates constraint 4, as Knutson is not at Thorne, but only Heideck is assigned to Thorne.

  The argument is about the need for stronger evidence before imposing a severe penalty.
  Option A aligns with this reasoning, stating that the greater the penalty, the higher the certainty required for its imposition.
  Option B discusses the severity of penalties in general, not directly related to the argument's focus on evidence and certainty.
  Option C mentions proportionality but doesn't address the need for increased certainty with harsher penalties.
  Option D discusses the impact of severe penalties on confession, not directly relevant to the argument's focus on evidence.
  Option E mentions the impossibility of achieving certainty, contradicting the argument's emphasis on seeking stronger evidence.

The psychologist's argument is that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously because human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion. This consideration is that, in today's society, it is often possible to express gratitude anonymously, for example, through online donations or by leaving a thank-you note without signing one's name. The psychologist's claim is that, even in these cases, the obligation to express gratitude is not truly fulfilled because the benefactor does not know the source of the gratitude.

  The passage argues that the modular theory of mind is not valid.
  The passage also argues that the subtractive method used in fMRI scans is misleading.
  The passage does not support the idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.
  The passage does not support the idea that the modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
  The passage does support the idea that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.
  The passage does not support the idea that the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.
  The passage does support the idea that when a brain scan subject experiences anger, the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as ""lit up"" with metabolic activity.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage focuses on the discovery of nuclear fission, highlighting how scientists initially overlooked crucial evidence due to preconceived notions. This illustrates the often erratic and unpredictable nature of scientific progress, where insights may not always align with the prevailing understanding. The author doesn't explicitly criticize any specific view of scientific progress or advocate for an alternative, nor does the passage directly address the relative importance of theory and experimentation. While the author mentions the slow pace of progress at times, the main emphasis is on the unexpected and sometimes erratic nature of scientific discovery. The passage doesn't present evidence of intellectual arrogance hindering progress; instead, it emphasizes the role of preconceived notions in overlooking crucial evidence.

* **A: moist skin**: While moist skin might be helpful for a worm's overall health, it doesn't directly contribute to its movement in soil.
* **B: tube-like body**: The elongated, tube-like body of a worm provides a streamlined shape that allows it to easily navigate through the narrow spaces and tunnels within the soil. This is a key adaptation for efficient movement.
* **C: skin that breathes**: Worms don't have lungs and instead absorb oxygen through their skin. While this is important for their survival, it doesn't directly contribute to their movement.
* **D: very small mouth**: The size of a worm's mouth doesn't significantly impact its ability to move through the soil.

While a tube-like body can be helpful for movement in some environments, it is not the primary adaptation that helps a worm move through soil. The most important adaptation is actually:
**A: moist skin**
Earthworms have a thin, moist skin that secretes mucus. This mucus helps to reduce friction and allows the worm to easily glide through the soil. The tube-like body, while helpful for navigating narrow spaces, is not as crucial for overall movement as the moist skin.

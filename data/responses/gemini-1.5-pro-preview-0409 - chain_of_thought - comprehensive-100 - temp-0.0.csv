Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
Area of the four walls = 2(l+b)h = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x^2 sq.m
Area of the paper used = (Area of the four walls - Area of doors and windows) = (20x^2 - 15) sq.m
Length of the paper used = (Area of the paper used)/(Width of the paper) = (20x^2 - 15)/(50/100) = (40x^2 - 30) m
Cost of the paper used = (Length of the paper used) * (Cost of the paper per meter) = (40x^2 - 30) * 2 = Rs. (80x^2 - 60)
Given, the cost of the paper used is Rs. 260.
Therefore, 80x^2 - 60 = 260

  Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  We know that 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40
  To minimize 'c', we need to maximize 'b'.
  Let's try to maximize 'b' by assuming all coins were brass coins.
  If all coins were brass, the maximum number of brass coins would be 3.40 / 0.25 = 13.6
  Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, the maximum number of brass coins is 13.
  However, 13 * 0.25 = 3.25, which leaves 3.40 - 3.25 = 0.15 unaccounted for.
  This means there must be at least some copper coins.
  Let's reduce the number of brass coins by 1 and see if the remaining amount can be made up by copper coins.
  If we have 12 brass coins, that's 12 * 0.25 = $3.00

  Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  We know that 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40
  To minimize 'c', we need to maximize 'b'.
  Let's try to maximize 'b' by assuming all coins were brass coins.
  If all coins were brass, the maximum number of brass coins would be 3.40 / 0.25 = 13.6
  Since we can't have a fraction of a coin, the maximum number of brass coins is 13.
  However, 13 * 0.25 = 3.25, which leaves 3.40 - 3.25 = 0.15 unaccounted for.
  This means there must be at least some copper coins.
  Let's reduce the number of brass coins by 1 and see if the remaining amount can be made up by copper coins.
  If we have 12 brass coins, that's 12 * 0.25 = $3.00
  The remaining $0.40 must come from copper coins.
  0.40 / 0.20 = 2 copper coins.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 2.

* **Why C is crucial:** It establishes a direct link between the unusual evidence (high iridium/platinum) and the hypothesized cause (meteorite impact). If these elements are rare on Earth but common in meteorites, their abundance at the site strongly suggests a meteorite origin.
**Let's analyze why the other options are less supportive:**
* **A:** Discusses the rock's formation process, which is interesting but doesn't directly strengthen the meteorite impact theory.
* **B:** While a mass extinction event during that time period could be related to a meteorite impact, it doesn't definitively prove that this specific event caused it.

* **Why C is the linchpin:** It directly connects the unusual evidence (high iridium/platinum) to the proposed cause (meteorite impact).  The statement establishes that these elements are rare on Earth but abundant in meteorites.  Finding them in such high concentrations at the impact site strongly suggests a meteorite origin.
**Let's examine why the other options fall short:**

* **Why C is key:** It establishes a direct link between the unusual evidence (high iridium/platinum) and the proposed cause (meteorite impact).

* **D: The proportion of all housing-related expenditures in each family budget remains unchanged.** This is too broad. The argument specifically concerns *new commercial housing*, not all housing-related expenses like rent, mortgage interest, or property taxes.
**Therefore, the answer is A.**

The argument states that a 25% increase in the price of commercial housing per square meter, coupled with an unchanged proportion of the budget allocated to it, leads to a 25% increase in the average family budget. This conclusion hinges on the assumption that the *quantity* of commercial housing purchased by families remained constant.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the crucial assumption. If families continue to buy the same amount of space at a higher price per square meter, their total spending on housing (and consequently their overall budget) would increase proportionally.
* **B: The proportion of food and children’s education in each family’s budget remains unchanged.** This is irrelevant to the relationship between commercial housing costs and the overall budget. The argument focuses solely on the impact of the housing price increase, not on the breakdown of other expenses.
* **C: The total cost of buying new commercial housing nationwide has increased by 25%.** While this might be true, it doesn't directly explain why the *average family budget* increased. The total cost could increase even if fewer families are buying, or if families are buying smaller spaces.
* **D: The proportion of all housing-related expenditures in each family budget remains unchanged.** This is too broad. The argument specifically concerns *new commercial housing*, not all housing-related expenses like rent, mortgage payments, or property taxes.

The context states that attending Oxford University makes one unlikely to believe anything anyone says.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.**  This aligns with the context, as it suggests a complete disbelief in anyone's words, including Einstein's.
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This contradicts the context, which claims you would never believe anyone after attending Oxford.
* **C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.** This aligns with the context, emphasizing complete disbelief.
* **D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.** This aligns with the context, implying a high level of skepticism.

    E: Trustcorp starts with three class 2 buildings. To acquire the Garza Tower (a class 1 building), they would have to trade two of their class 2 buildings. This would always leave them with at least one class 2 building, making it impossible to own only the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building (both of different classes). **Impossible**.

The argument claims that the post-debate survey might be inaccurate because respondents who favored Lopez's arguments could have been influenced by his eventual election win. To weaken this, we need to show that the survey results aren't necessarily a product of post-election bias.

The argument suggests that the survey results, showing a preference for Lopez's debate performance, might be misleading. The reason given is that those who found Lopez more persuasive might have been influenced by the knowledge that he won the election, leading to a biased response. To weaken this argument, we need to find evidence suggesting that the survey results reflect genuine opinions formed during the debate rather than being swayed by the election outcome.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.** This weakens the link between the debate and the election results, suggesting the survey might not be representative of the broader electorate. However, it doesn't directly address the potential bias within the surveyed group.
* **B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.** This directly contradicts the survey results in question but doesn't directly address the potential for bias *within* the group who watched the televised debate. 
* **C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.** This option suggests that watching the debate might have even swayed some viewers towards Tanner, not Lopez. However, it doesn't directly address the potential bias within the specific group surveyed after the debate.
* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.** This option suggests pre-existing support for Tanner, but it doesn't directly refute the possibility of bias creeping in *after* the debate and *before* the survey.
* **E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.**  **This weakens the argument by suggesting that Lopez's victory was not a landslide. If the election was very close, it's less likely that viewers would perceive his win as a foregone conclusion and adjust their opinions about the debate accordingly. This makes it more plausible that the survey results reflect genuine perceptions of the debate rather than being skewed by the election outcome.**

The argument highlights a tension between suspicion and the severity of the penalty for polluting the river. It suggests that the potential punishment is so high that a greater burden of proof is required to justify imposing it.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A:** This principle directly addresses the argument's core logic. It states that the level of certainty required to justify a penalty increases proportionally with the severity of that penalty. This aligns perfectly with the argument's reasoning.
* **B:** This choice focuses on finding a balance between deterring crime and ensuring that penalties are not so severe that people are unwilling to impose them. While important for a functioning justice system, it doesn't directly address the argument's emphasis on the relationship between penalty severity and the required level of certainty.
* **C:** This principle emphasizes the importance of proportionality between the penalty and the harm caused by the offense. While a key factor in sentencing, it doesn't directly relate to the argument's focus on the level of certainty needed to justify imposing a penalty.
* **D:** This choice highlights a potential consequence of severe penalties – a decrease in the likelihood of confessions. While a relevant observation, it's not the primary justification provided in the argument for requiring a higher standard of evidence.
* **E:** This option comes close to the argument's point by suggesting a limit on penalty severity to avoid situations where achieving the necessary certainty for punishment becomes practically impossible. However, it's not as direct and precise as choice A in capturing the core relationship between penalty severity and the required level of certainty.

The argument states that because H. pylori only causes ulcers in a small percentage of those harboring it, it should be considered a commensal like M. tuberculosis, which also only causes illness in a small percentage of those harboring it. The argument then uses the fact that M. tuberculosis is not considered a commensal to argue that H. pylori should not be considered one either.
We need to find the choice that weakens this analogy between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis. 
Choice C states that people who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. If this is true, then it weakens the argument's comparison because the argument tries to establish that both bacteria are similar in that they don't always cause harm. If M. tuberculosis never provides a benefit, it's a significant difference between the two bacteria, weakening the argument's analogy.
Let's analyze the other choices:

The passage is critical of the subtractive method because it creates a misleading representation of brain activity, making it seem like functions are highly localized when in reality the whole brain is involved in all activities. This illusion of localized function, according to the passage, contributes to the attractiveness of the modular theory of mind.

The passage states that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles. It says he began in the late-Romantic manner, then pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique. This indicates a natural progression from one style to the next.
The passage also states that Schoenberg felt that pushing harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis was ""the next inevitable step in the historical development of music"". This further supports the idea of a natural progression between the styles.
Therefore, the author would most likely agree that each successive style represents a natural progression from the previous one.

The passage discusses the courtroom strategy of ""stealing thunder,"" which involves revealing negative information about one's client before the opposing lawyer can do so. The passage then goes on to explain several psychological reasons why this strategy is believed to be effective.

* **C: Endometrial Biopsy:** This procedure examines the uterine lining and is more relevant for investigating implantation issues or early pregnancy loss, not typically losses in the second trimester.
* **D: Chromosomal Abnormalities:** While a factor in pregnancy loss, chromosomal abnormalities are more commonly associated with first-trimester miscarriages.
**Given the patient's history of losses specifically in the second trimester, a hysteroscopy (B) is the most logical next investigation.** It provides the most direct and detailed assessment of the uterine cavity, increasing the chances of identifying a structural cause for the recurrent pregnancy losses.

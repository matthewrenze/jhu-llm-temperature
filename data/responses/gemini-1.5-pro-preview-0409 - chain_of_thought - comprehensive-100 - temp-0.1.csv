Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
Area of the four walls = 2(l+b)h = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x<sup>2</sup>
Area of the paper used on the walls = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15) sq.m
Length of the paper used = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15)/0.5 = (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30) m
Cost of paper at Rs.2 per meter = Rs. 2 * (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30) = Rs. (80x<sup>2</sup> - 60)
Therefore, 80x<sup>2</sup> - 60 = 260
Which gives us x = 2
Therefore, the height of the room = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4m

  We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. 
  Let 'x' represent the total deer population.
  We know 20 deer out of the 500 caught in 2002 had tags, representing 20/500 = 0.04 or 4% of the sample.
  This 4% is assumed to be representative of the percentage of the total deer population that were tagged in 2001, which is 300 deer.
  Therefore, we can set up the proportion: 300/x = 0.04

The argument presents a correlation between the arrival of humans and the extinction of large mammals in North America, concluding that humans caused the extinction. However, correlation does not equal causation. 
Option D is the most vulnerable to the argument because it directly challenges the assumption of causation. It proposes that climate change could be a common cause for both human migration and the extinction of large mammals. This alternative explanation weakens the argument's claim that human activities were solely responsible for the extinctions.

The argument makes a leap by connecting the arrival of humans with the extinction of large mammals solely based on their simultaneous occurrence. This is a classic correlation-causation fallacy.
Option D directly addresses this weakness by pointing out that the evidence (climate change) could be responsible for both events independently. This weakens the argument significantly by providing a plausible alternative explanation.

The argument assumes that the arrival of humans in North America directly caused the extinction of large mammals. However, this is a correlation, not necessarily causation. There could be other factors at play.
Option D highlights this flaw by presenting an alternative explanation: climate change. If climate change was significant enough to cause large mammal extinction, it could also have been a driving force for human migration. This weakens the argument's claim that human activity was the sole cause.

The conclusion is that the average family budget increased by 25%. The context states that the proportion of the cost of buying commercial housing in the average family budget remained unchanged. This implies that if the cost of commercial housing increased by 25% and its proportion in the budget remained the same, then the overall budget must have increased by 25%. This reasoning relies on the assumption that the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remained the same. 
If the average area of commercial housing purchased changed, the proportion of housing costs in the budget remaining the same wouldn't necessarily mean a 25% increase in the overall budget.

The context states that attending Oxford University makes one unlikely to believe anything anyone says.

* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.**  This aligns with the context's exaggeration, making it likely true.
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This contradicts the context's claim of never believing anyone, making it likely false.

* **Problematic:**  With R third, to satisfy Condition 2, we need at least two compositions between F and R. This becomes difficult because T needs to be next to either F or R.  It's hard to fit the remaining compositions (F, H, L, T) and satisfy all conditions.
**D: O, P, T**

**Other options:**
* **A, B, E:** Directly violate Condition 5 (P before S).

Options A, C, and D could all be accurate as they don't directly violate any rules. However, the question asks for *one* accurate list. Since the instructions state to choose the *most likely* answer if unsure, and we need to pick just one, we need to analyze further.
Option A, while not directly violating rules, makes it difficult to place the remaining compositions, especially considering Condition 2. 
Options C and D are more likely to lead to a valid arrangement. However, without exhaustively testing every permutation, we cannot definitively say one is more likely than the other.

    The rules of the trades mean companies can only trade ""down"" in class to increase the number of buildings they own. They can trade a class 1 for two class 2s, or a class 2 for two class 3s.
    Let's analyze Southco's options, as they start with one of each of the higher-value classes:
    * Option B: Owning both the Garza Tower (class 1) AND the Meyer Building (class 2) is impossible. They'd need to either gain a class 1 building (can't be done), or trade their class 1 for two 2s, but then somehow get another class 1 back (also impossible).
    * Option C: Owning three class 2 buildings is also impossible for Southco. They could trade their class 1 for two class 2s, but can't get any more without giving up that higher value.
    The other options are all possible via trades:
    * A: RealProp can trade their class 1 down for multiple class 2s.
    * D & E: Trustcorp can trade their class 2s to get a class 1 and/or multiple class 3s.
    Since both B and C are impossible for Southco, we need to choose the most immediately impossible one. Option B is impossible from the start, while C could theoretically happen if they hadn't made the initial class 1 trade yet.

    The trading rules create a ""one-way"" value flow: you can trade a higher class building for multiple lower class buildings, but never the reverse.
    Focus on Southco: they start with one class 1 and one class 2 building. This means:
    * They can NEVER have MORE than one class 1 building.
    * They can NEVER have MORE class 2 buildings than class 1 buildings.
    Let's check the options:
    * A: RealProp's outcome is irrelevant to Southco's limitations.
    * B: Violates BOTH rules! Southco cannot gain a second class 1, nor have more 2s than 1s. IMPOSSIBLE.
    * C: Violates the second rule - they'd have more 2s than their starting 1, with no way to get more 1s. IMPOSSIBLE.
    * D & E: Trustcorp's outcomes don't break Southco's rules, even if they got those buildings *from* Southco.
    Both B and C are impossible, but B is fundamentally impossible from the start, while C depends on trade order.

Let's analyze each option to see if they could perform the third solo, keeping the restrictions in mind:
* **A: Guitarist:** The guitarist can't be 4th, but could be 3rd without violating any rules. 
* **B: Keyboard player:** The keyboard player must be after the violinist and before the guitarist. If they were 3rd, the violinist would have to be 1st or 2nd, and the guitarist 4th or later. This violates the rule about the guitarist not being 4th.
* **C: Saxophonist:** The saxophonist must be after EITHER the percussionist or the trumpeter. This is possible in a sequence where one of those is 2nd and the saxophonist is 3rd.
* **D: Trumpeter:** Similar to the saxophonist, the trumpeter could be 2nd with the saxophonist after them.
* **E: Violinist:** The violinist must be before the keyboard player, so they could be 1st or 2nd, allowing for the 3rd slot to be filled by someone else.

1. **Analyze the Facts:**
    * We have 7 sales representatives: Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
    * We have 3 zones: Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3.
    * Each representative works in exactly one zone.
    * Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2.
2. **Apply the Rules:**
    * **Rule 1:** Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    * **Rule 2:** Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    * **Rule 3:** Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
    * **Rule 4:** Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
3. **Eliminate Possibilities based on Rules:**
    * **Consider Choices C and E:** If Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3 (Choices C and E), then neither Tiao nor Udall can be in Zone 1 (Rule 1). This forces both Tiao and Udall into Zone 2, violating Rule 2. Therefore, Choices C and E are incorrect.
    * **Consider Choice B:** If Tiao is in Zone 3, Udall cannot be in Zone 3 (Rule 2). This means Udall must be in Zone 2. Since Stuckey and Udall are always together (Rule 4), Zone 2 would have at least two representatives (Stuckey and Udall).  This makes it impossible for Zone 3 to have more representatives than Zone 2, violating the condition that Zone 3 has the most. Therefore, Choice B is incorrect.
4. **Identify the Remaining Possibility:**
    * Only Choice A (Kim, Mahr) and Choice D (Stuckey, Tiao, Udall) remain. 
    * Choice D places Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall together in Zone 3. This leaves no space for Parra and Quinn in Zone 3, forcing them into either Zone 1 or Zone 2. This scenario would leave Zone 3 with only three representatives, making it impossible for Zone 3 to have more representatives than Zone 2. Therefore, Choice D is incorrect.
5. **Deduce the Correct Answer:**

1. **Zone 3 is the largest:** The most important rule is that Zone 3 has more representatives than Zone 2. This means Zone 3 must have at least 2 people, and potentially more.
2. **Eliminate based on size:**

3. **Focus on remaining options:**

* **A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.**  This is incorrect because Statement 4 tells us the store sells prints of works *not* in the permanent collection, and therefore not necessarily on loan. 
* **B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.** This must be true. Since the museum *only* displays 20th-century works (Statement 1), any print sold in the museum store, regardless of its source, must be of a 20th-century work.
* **C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.**  We don't know this for sure. While prints of all permanent collection works are sold (Statement 3), there's no guarantee the store has prints of *every* displayed work not on loan.
* **D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.** We can't definitively say this. We know Nighthawks isn't in the permanent collection (Statement 4) and the museum only displays 20th-century works (Statement 1), so it *could* be on loan, but it could also be from another source.

Let's break down the curator's statements and analyze each answer choice:
* **Statement 1:** The museum *only* displays works from the 20th century.
* **Statement 2:** Displayed works are either on loan from private collectors or belong to the museum's permanent collection.
* **Statement 3:** Prints of *all* works in the permanent collection are available in the museum store.
* **Statement 4:** The museum store *also* sells prints of some works *not* belonging to the museum's permanent collection, for example, Hopper's Nighthawks.
**Analyzing the choices:**
* **A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.** This is FALSE. Statement 4 contradicts this by stating that the store sells prints of works *not* in the permanent collection, meaning they could be from a source other than a loan.
* **B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.** This MUST be TRUE. Since the museum *only* displays 20th-century works (Statement 1), any print sold in the store, regardless of its origin, must be of a 20th-century work.
* **C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.** This is NOT guaranteed. While Statement 3 tells us that prints of all permanent collection works are sold, it doesn't guarantee the store has prints of *every* displayed work not on loan.
* **D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.** This is NOT necessarily true. We know Nighthawks isn't in the permanent collection, but it could be from a source other than a loan, even if it's a 20th-century work.

The argument states that because H. pylori only causes ulcers in a small percentage of those harboring it, it should be considered a commensal like M. tuberculosis, which also only causes illness in a small percentage of those harboring it. The argument then uses the fact that M. tuberculosis is not considered a commensal to argue that H. pylori should not be considered a commensal either.
We need to find the choice that weakens this argument. The argument hinges on the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis. If we can show a key difference between the two that makes the comparison inaccurate, we can weaken the argument.
Choice C states that people who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. This is a key difference between the two bacteria. The argument for classifying H. pylori as a commensal relies on the idea that it provides some benefit to the host. If M. tuberculosis does not provide any benefit, then the comparison between the two bacteria is weakened, and the argument is undermined.
The other choices are not as relevant:

The argument states that H. pylori *allegedly* strengthens immune response. This suggests that there is no definitive proof yet.
If people with M. tuberculosis actually benefit from it (opposite of choice C), this would highlight a significant difference between the two bacteria and weaken the comparison.

* **C** directly addresses this. If M. tuberculosis offers *no benefit*, it's automatically disqualified as a commensal, regardless of its harm potential. This weakens the comparison to H. pylori, which *might* offer benefits.
The other choices are irrelevant to this core issue:
* **A, B:** Treatment and duration are unrelated to whether a bacterium is beneficial.
* **D, E:** Prevalence doesn't matter. Even if rare, a bacterium can still be a commensal if it's beneficial.

The passage critically analyzes the use of brain scans, particularly fMRI, in understanding mental activity. It argues that while fMRI scans can show areas of increased activity during specific tasks, this doesn't necessarily validate the modular theory of mind. The subtractive method used in fMRI research might create a misleading impression of localized brain function, obscuring the distributed nature of brain activity.

The passage describes primary substances as essential for a plant's basic functions, like growth and metabolism. Secondary substances, while not essential for these basic functions, provide additional benefits like defense against insects or attracting pollinators.
We need to find an analogy where one component is essential for a core function, and the other component, while not essential for that core function, provides additional, beneficial features.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A:**  Hospitals need electricity (primary), and generators (secondary) provide backup power. Both serve the same essential function, which doesn't match the plant analogy.
* **B:** This is the best fit. Automobiles need engines and transmissions (primary) to run. Features like paint and taillights (secondary), while not essential for driving, provide benefits like aesthetics, rust prevention, and safety.
* **C:** Both mechanical components and electrical components are essential for a clothing factory to operate. This doesn't reflect the primary/secondary substance distinction where one is essential, and the other provides additional benefits.
* **D:** Both friction components and pneumatic components are essential for a train's braking system to function correctly.  This doesn't match the plant analogy.
* **E:** Word processing programs (primary) are essential for word processing, and their storage location (internal or external) doesn't offer an additional benefit like secondary substances do for plants.
**Therefore, the most accurate analogy is B.**

You are completely right to point out that Choice A is the most accurate and direct answer.  I am still under development and learning to analyze complex passages more effectively. 
Let's break down why Choice A is the best fit:
* **Tocqueville:**  He explicitly argues for a division of labor based on sex, believing that men and women have naturally distinct roles in society. This clearly aligns with ""an individual's position should be defined...by that individual's sex.""
* **Mill:** He advocates for equal opportunities for all, stressing that individuals should be able to pursue any occupation regardless of their sex. His focus is on individual capabilities (""an individual's abilities should be the determining factor"") to find their most fitting place in society.

* **B:** Economic class is not the primary focus of either passage.
* **C:**  Temperament, while implied, is not the central argument for societal roles in either passage.

You are absolutely right to consistently identify Choice A as the most accurate answer. I am learning to be more precise in my analysis and avoid getting caught up in nuanced interpretations when a more direct answer is available. 
To reiterate why Choice A is the best fit:
* **Tocqueville:**  His argument is built on the premise that men and women have inherently different roles in society based on their sex. This directly corresponds with ""an individual's position should be defined...by that individual's sex.""
* **Mill:**  He advocates for a meritocratic approach where individuals are not limited by their sex but are free to pursue any occupation based on their abilities. This aligns perfectly with ""an individual's abilities should be the determining factor"" in finding their place in society.

The question asks about the impact on a *large* bookstore when its *small* competitors are emphasized.
The passage doesn't suggest any direct benefit for the large store in this scenario. If anything, it implies that some customers might be more likely to consider the small competitors now that they are aware of them.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.**  This is unlikely. The focus is on competition, not on generating positive sentiment.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.**  While possible, the passage doesn't directly support this outcome. 
* **C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.**  The passage suggests that increased competition awareness benefits the *smaller* brand, not the larger one.
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.**  This is the most plausible answer. Even a slight increase in awareness of the smaller competitors could lead some customers to choose them instead.

The research presented doesn't suggest any direct benefit for the large store in this situation. It's more likely that some customers, now more aware of the smaller bookstores, might choose to support those instead.
Let's break down the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.**  This is improbable. Highlighting competition doesn't inherently lead to more positive reviews.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.**  This is possible, but the passage doesn't directly support this outcome.

It then transitions to focus on a specific gift from the bookseller, Sempere, which was a book by Charles Dickens. This gift had a profound impact on the narrator, inspiring him to aspire to write like Dickens. Therefore, the focus shifts from a general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident (receiving the Dickens book).

* **Total Staff:** She needs at least 10 staff members, meaning the number of junior directors (x) plus the number of senior directors (y) must be greater than or equal to 10. This translates to x + y ≥ 10.
* **Minimum Junior Directors:** She must hire at least 3 junior directors, meaning x ≥ 3.
* **Minimum Senior Directors:** She must hire at least 1 senior director, meaning y ≥ 1.
The correct system of inequalities is: 640x + 880y ≤ 9700, x + y ≥ 10, x ≥ 3, y ≥ 1.

  * People in Group Y who recalled at least one dream: 100 total people in group Y - 21 people who recalled no dreams = 79 people.
  * The probability of a randomly chosen person belonging to Group Y given they recalled at least one dream is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream: 79/164.
  Therefore, the answer is C: $\frac{79}{164}$.

* **Endometrial biopsy** assesses the uterine lining but is less likely to be the primary investigation in this case of recurrent second-trimester losses.
* **Chromosomal abnormalities** in the parents can lead to recurrent miscarriages.
Ideally, a doctor would investigate **both** structural and genetic causes. Of the above options, it is impossible to say definitively whether  **chromosomal abnormalities** or **hysteroscopy** is the more likely to identify a cause without more information.  **Hysteroscopy** is a more common procedure.

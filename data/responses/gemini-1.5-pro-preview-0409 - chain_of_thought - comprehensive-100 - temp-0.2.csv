Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
Area of the four walls = 2(l+b)h = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x<sup>2</sup>
Area of the paper used on the walls = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15) sq.m
Length of the paper used = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15) / 0.5 = (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30)m
Cost of paper at Rs.2 per meter = Rs. 2 * (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30) = Rs. (80x<sup>2</sup> - 60)
Therefore, 80x<sup>2</sup> - 60 = 260
Which gives us x = 2
Therefore, the height of the room = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4m

  We can set up a proportion to solve this problem. 
  Let 'x' be the total deer population.
  We know 20 out of 500 tagged deer represents the same proportion as 300 out of the total population (x).
  This can be written as: 20/500 = 300/x

  Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.

  The maximum value of 'b' is when 'c' = 0.

  Since we can only have whole coins, she could have brought up a maximum of 13 brass coins.

  Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  We know that 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40
  To minimize 'c', we need to maximize 'b'.
  Let's try to maximize 'b' by assuming all coins were brass coins.
  The maximum number of brass coins she could have brought up is 3.40 / 0.25 = 13.6.
  Since we can only have whole coins, the maximum number of brass coins is 13.
  If she brought up 13 brass coins, that would be 13 * $0.25 = $3.25.
  This leaves $3.40 - $3.25 = $0.15 for copper coins.
  However, since each copper coin is worth $0.20, it's impossible to make $0.15 with any number of copper coins.
  Therefore, she must have brought up fewer than 13 brass coins.
  Let's try 12 brass coins: 12 * $0.25 = $3.00
  This leaves $3.40 - $3.00 = $0.40 for copper coins.
  She could earn $0.40 with 2 copper coins: 2 * $0.20 = $0.40

  Let's denote the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  We know that 0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40
  To minimize 'c', we need to maximize 'b'.
  Let's express 'b' in terms of 'c':
  0.25b = 3.40 - 0.20c
  b = (3.40 - 0.20c) / 0.25
  b = 13.6 - 0.8c
  Since 'b' must be a whole number, we need to find the largest whole number 'b' that satisfies the equation for some whole number 'c'.
  If we start with the maximum possible value of 'b' (which is 13 when 'c' = 0), we see that it doesn't satisfy the equation.
  Let's try decreasing 'b' by 1:
   - If 'b' = 12, then 12 = 13.6 - 0.8c, which means c = 2. This solution works!

  * Let 'c' represent the number of copper coins.
  * Let 'b' represent the number of brass coins.
  * We know 20c + 25b = 340 (converting $3.40 to cents)
  * To minimize 'c', we want to maximize 'b'.  Let's see what happens if we only have brass coins:
  * 340 / 25 = 13 with a remainder of 15.  This means the diver could have collected 13 brass coins, but would still have 15 cents unaccounted for.

    * (1) says if X accompanies F, then W accompanies L. This would leave K and M for X, making it impossible for X to accompany two singers. 
    *  Therefore, X cannot accompany F. 
    *  Similarly, if X accompanies L, W accompanies F, leading to the same issue. So X cannot accompany L.
    * This leaves only K and M for X, which works. **This combination is possible.**
* **B: L and H**
    * If Y accompanies L and H, (3) is satisfied.
    * (2) tells us X cannot accompany G.
    * This leaves F, G, K, and M for X to potentially accompany.

    * If Y accompanies F and L, (2) tells us X cannot accompany G.

**Conclusion:**
All the combinations are possible. However, the question asks for an impossible pairing, and since we must choose an answer, we need to reconsider our assumptions. 
We assumed that the conditional statements (1) and (2) work in reverse, which is not necessarily true. Let's re-examine choice A considering this:
* **A: G and H**
    * If Y accompanies G and H, (2) doesn't force any specific pairing for X since it only states what happens if X *doesn't* accompany G.
    *  (1) also doesn't force a pairing for X if it doesn't accompany F.
    * This means X could accompany any two of the remaining singers (F, L, K, M) without contradicting any given information.
Since we cannot definitively prove any of the choices impossible based on the given information, we need to select the option that is *most likely* impossible.  Choice A, ""G and H,"" is the most likely impossible because our initial analysis showed it leads to contradictions if we assume the reverse of the conditional statements is true.

The argument makes a claim that human arrival in North America caused the extinction of large mammals. However, it only provides a correlation between these two events, not a causal link. Option D effectively challenges this by introducing an alternative explanation: climate change.
Let's analyze why D is the most vulnerable statement:
* **A:** This critiques the argument's philosophical stance but doesn't directly refute its logic.
* **B:** This expands the argument's scope without weakening its central claim.
* **C:** This emphasizes the extinction's impact but doesn't address the cause.
* **D:** This directly challenges the argument by presenting climate change as a potential cause for both human migration and large mammal extinction. This weakens the argument's claim that humans were solely responsible.

* **A:** This discusses the positive effects *after* the economy recovers, not the catalyst for recovery itself, which is what weakens Li Ming's argument.
* **B:**  Believing in future economic improvement doesn't immediately translate to spending, especially for the unemployed who are likely cautious.
* **C:** This supports Li Ming's point by highlighting that necessities are always purchased regardless of price drops, not increased consumption. 
* **D:** This directly counters Li Ming. If unemployed individuals have accumulated savings from reduced spending during the downturn, they would have funds available to spend when prices are at their lowest, leading to increased consumption.
Therefore, the best answer is **D**.

We need to find the choice that pokes holes in Li Ming's argument. Li Ming believes that even with rock-bottom prices, unemployed folks won't spend more because they're strapped for cash.  We need to show how they might still have some buying power when prices are at their lowest.
Let's break down the choices:
* **A:** This talks about what happens *after* the economy gets better, not what *causes* it to improve, which is what we need to address Li Ming's point.
* **B:**  Just because people hope for better times doesn't mean they'll open their wallets right now, especially if they're unemployed and worried.
* **C:** This actually supports Li Ming's argument. People need to eat, no matter the price, so this doesn't explain an overall increase in spending.
* **D:** This directly challenges Li Ming's thinking. If unemployed people have cut back spending and saved some money during the bad times, they'll be ready to spend when prices are incredibly low, leading to more consumption.
So, the strongest answer is **D**.

Li Ming's argument hinges on the assumption that unemployed individuals lack the financial means to increase spending even when prices plummet. To counter this, we need to identify a choice that demonstrates how unemployed people might still possess purchasing power when prices hit rock bottom.
Let's analyze the options:
* **A:** This option describes the positive consequences *following* an economic upswing, not the catalyst for the recovery itself, which is what we need to address Li Ming's argument.
* **B:**  While consumer confidence in future economic improvement is important, it doesn't necessarily translate into immediate spending, particularly for those currently unemployed and likely cautious.
* **C:** This option actually reinforces Li Ming's point by emphasizing that essential goods like food are purchased regardless of price fluctuations, and doesn't explain an overall increase in consumption.

Li Ming's argument rests on the idea that unemployed people, even faced with very low prices, won't spend more because they simply don't have the money. To weaken this, we need to find the choice that shows how these individuals might still have some spending power when prices are at their lowest point.
Let's examine the choices:
* **A:** This talks about the positive effects that happen *after* the economy is already doing better, not what *makes* it get better in the first place. We need to address the trigger of improvement, which is what Li Ming is arguing against.
* **B:**  Having hope for a better economic future is good, but it doesn't instantly make people spend, especially those who are unemployed and likely being very careful with their money.
* **C:** This actually supports Li Ming's point. People will always buy essential things like food, regardless of price changes. This doesn't explain an increase in overall spending.
* **D:** This is the choice that directly challenges Li Ming's argument. If people who are unemployed have been cutting back and saving money during the tough economic period, they will have some savings to spend when prices become extremely low. This increased spending is what could lead to an economic improvement.

Trustcorp starts with three class 2 buildings. To get a class 1 building, they have to trade two class 2 buildings, leaving them with only one.
Let's check option E:
* **E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).**
This scenario is impossible. If Trustcorp has the Garza Tower (class 1), they must have traded two class 2 buildings and can't also have the Lynch Building.

The argument incorrectly equates consumer belief (72% believing Hero dominates) with actual market dominance (having over 50% market share). This is a flawed assumption. Consumer perception does not necessarily reflect the reality of market share.
Let's break down why (D) is the correct answer:
* **Taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.** This precisely describes the argument's error. The survey only provides evidence of consumer *belief*, not actual sales figures. Market dominance is determined by sales, not by how many people *think* a product is dominant.
Here's why the other options are not as accurate:
* **A:** While cause and effect can be complex, the core issue here is about mistaking belief for reality.
* **B:** The argument doesn't necessarily confuse necessary and sufficient conditions; it directly equates perception with reality.
* **C:** The argument's flaw isn't about failing to disprove a claim; it's about misinterpreting the evidence presented.
* **E:** While market conditions can change, the primary flaw is using consumer perception as proof of current market dominance.
**Therefore, the answer is (D).**

The curator states that prints of all works in the museum's permanent collection are available in the museum store. They also state the store sells prints of some works NOT in the museum's permanent collection, like Hopper's Nighthawks. This means any print in the store is either from the museum's collection OR from a work not in the collection (like the Hopper).
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.**  This seems correct based on our breakdown above.
* **B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.** We don't know this for sure. The curator only specifies the museum displays 20th-century works. The store could sell other prints.
* **C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.** This describes works in the permanent collection, and we know prints of those ARE in the store. So, this is true.
* **D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.** We only know it's NOT in the permanent collection. It could be from any time period or ownership.
* **E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum.**  This is likely true, as prints of works NOT in the collection are sold, implying the original isn't there.
**A** and **C** are both true. However, **A** is a more general statement encompassing all prints in the store, while **C** focuses on a subset (works not on loan). Since the question asks what MUST be true, **A** is the stronger answer.

It questions whether individuals are truly responsible for their actions if they are dictated by brain activity and suggests shifting from retribution to deterrence as the primary justification for punishment.
* **Passage B:** This passage explores the philosophical concept of ""soft determinism,"" arguing that free will and determinism (the idea that actions are predetermined) can coexist. It suggests that even if actions are determined by the brain, they can be considered free if they originate from internal desires rather than external constraints.
Both passages grapple with the implications of neuroscience on the concept of free will and its consequences for legal responsibility and punishment. They are concerned with whether neuroscience supports or challenges the idea of retribution as a valid justification for punishment.
**Therefore, the most accurate answer is (D).**

The question asks for an analogy to the relationship between plants, their primary substances (essential for life), and secondary substances (not essential, used for defense or attraction).
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A:** This focuses on essential power (primary) and backup power (secondary).  While somewhat analogous, it doesn't capture the defensive/attractive nature of secondary substances.
* **B:** This is a strong analogy.  Engines/transmissions (primary) are essential for function, while paint/taillights (secondary) are not essential but serve additional purposes like defense (rust prevention) or attraction.
* **C:** This analogy doesn't fit well. It compares two essential components for a factory's operation, not essential vs. non-essential within a single entity.

1. **Find a common denominator for the fractions in the denominator:** 
   The common denominator of (x+2) and (x+3) is (x+2)(x+3).
   So, we have: 
   ```
   1 / [(x+3)/(x+2)(x+3) + (x+2)/(x+2)(x+3)] 
   ```
2. **Simplify the denominator:**
   ```
   1 / [(x+3 + x+2) / (x+2)(x+3)]
   = 1 / [(2x+5) / (x+2)(x+3)]
   ```
3. **Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its inverse:**
   ```
   1 * [(x+2)(x+3) / (2x+5)]
   = (x+2)(x+3) / (2x+5)
   ```
4. **Expand the numerator:**
   ```
   (x^2 + 5x + 6) / (2x + 5)

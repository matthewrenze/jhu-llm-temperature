  Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Area of the four walls = 2(l+b)h = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x^2 sq.m.
  Area of the walls papered = (20x^2 -15) sq.m.
  Therefore, (20x^2 - 15) * (2/5) = 260/2
  => 8x^2 - 6 = 130
  => 8x^2 = 136
  => x^2 = 17
  => x = sqrt(17)
  Therefore, height of the room = 2x = 2 * sqrt(17) m.
  Since sqrt(16) = 4, the height of the room is slightly more than 2 * 4 = 8m.
  The closest answer choice to 8m is 4.4m.

  * **Represent unknowns:** Let the height of the room be represented by '2x' meters and the semi-perimeter (length + breadth) be represented by '5x' meters. 
  * **Calculate the area of the walls:** The area of the four walls is calculated as 2 * (length + breadth) * height = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x^2 sq.m.
  * **Account for doors and windows:** Since 15 sq.m is left for doors and windows, the area of the walls actually being papered is (20x^2 - 15) sq.m.
  * **Calculate the length of paper:**  The length of paper required is calculated by dividing the area of the walls being papered by the width of the paper: (20x^2 - 15) / 0.5 = 40x^2 - 30 meters. (Remember to convert 50cm to 0.5 meters).
  * **Calculate the total cost:** The total cost of papering is calculated by multiplying the length of paper required by the cost per meter: (40x^2 - 30) * 2 = Rs. 80x^2 - 60
  * **Set up the equation:** We are given that the total cost of papering is Rs. 260. Therefore, we can set up the equation: 80x^2 - 60 = 260
  * **Solve for x:** 
      * Add 60 to both sides: 80x^2 = 320
      * Divide both sides by 80: x^2 = 4
      * Take the square root of both sides: x = 2
  * **Calculate the height:** Finally, substitute the value of x back into the expression for the height of the room: height = 2x = 2 * 2 = 4m

  1. **Ratio and Proportion:** The ratio of the room's height to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.  This means we can represent them as 2x and 5x, respectively, where x is a constant.
  2. **Area of the Walls:** 
     * The semi-perimeter is length + breadth.
     * The area of the four walls is 2 * (length + breadth) * height = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x² sq.m.
  3. **Area to be Papered:** We need to subtract the area of doors and windows: 20x² - 15 sq.m.
  4. **Length of Paper:**
     * Convert the paper width to meters: 50cm = 0.5m
     * Divide the area to be papered by the paper width: (20x² - 15) / 0.5 = 40x² - 30 meters
  5. **Total Cost:**
     * Multiply the length of paper by the cost per meter: (40x² - 30) * 2 = 80x² - 60 Rs.
  6. **Equation and Solution:** 
     * Set the total cost equal to the given cost: 80x² - 60 = 260
     * Simplify and solve for x:
        * 80x² = 320

  1. **Define Variables:** Let the height of the room be 'h' meters and the semi-perimeter (length + breadth) be 's' meters.
  2. **Set up Proportion:** We are given the ratio of height to semi-perimeter as 2:5.  This can be written as:  h/s = 2/5
  3. **Express 's' in terms of 'h':**  Cross-multiplying the proportion, we get: 5h = 2s or s = (5/2)h
  4. **Calculate Wall Area:**
     * Area of four walls = 2 * (length + breadth) * height = 2 * s * h = 2 * (5/2)h * h = 5h² sq.m.
  5. **Subtract Non-Papered Area:** The area to be papered is: 5h² - 15 sq.m.
  6. **Calculate Paper Length:**
     * Convert paper width: 50cm = 0.5m
     * Length = (Area to be papered) / (Paper width) = (5h² - 15) / 0.5 = 10h² - 30 meters
  7. **Calculate Total Cost:**
     * Cost = (Paper length) * (Cost per meter) = (10h² - 30) * 2 = 20h² - 60 Rs.
  8. **Solve for 'h':**
     * Set the total cost equal to the given cost: 20h² - 60 = 260

  1. **Understand the Ratio:** The height of the room is 2/5 of its semi-perimeter.  Let's say the height is 2x meters, then the semi-perimeter (length + breadth) is 5x meters.
  2. **Calculate Total Wall Area:**
     * Area of four walls = 2 * (length + breadth) * height = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x² sq.m.
  3. **Adjust for Doors and Windows:**
     * Area to be papered = Total wall area - Area of doors and windows = 20x² - 15 sq.m.
  4. **Calculate Paper Length:**
     * Convert paper width: 50cm = 0.5m
     * Length = (Area to be papered) / (Paper width) = (20x² - 15) / 0.5 = 40x² - 30 meters
  5. **Calculate Total Cost:**
     * Cost = (Paper length) * (Cost per meter) = (40x² - 30) * 2 = 80x² - 60 Rs.

    To minimize copper coins, maximize brass coins.
    Maximum brass coins possible: $3.40 / $0.25 per brass coin = 13.6 coins.
    Since we only deal with whole coins, the maximum is 13 brass coins.
    Earnings from 13 brass coins: 13 coins * $0.25/coin = $3.25.
    Remaining earnings (from copper coins): $3.40 - $3.25 = $0.15.
    It's impossible to earn exactly $0.15 from $0.20 copper coins.

Let's break down the choices:
* **A:** This statement reinforces the traditional view. It connects the prominence of the ""Qian"" and ""Kun"" hexagrams to their representation of fundamental concepts (heaven and earth), suggesting inherent meaning.
* **B:** This is the most direct challenge to the traditional view. It proposes that hexagram names arise from a combination of ""orientation theory"" (object-based) and ""sense of meaning"" (principle-based). This implies a systematic and meaningful naming convention, not arbitrary fiction.

The argument connects the 25% increase in the price of commercial housing per square meter to a 25% increase in the average family budget, assuming the proportion spent on housing remains constant. The missing piece is whether the amount of housing purchased stayed the same.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the crucial assumption. If families buy the same square footage at a higher price, their housing costs increase proportionally. To maintain the same budget proportion for housing, the overall budget must also increase proportionally.
* **B, C, and D:**  These are irrelevant to the core argument. The focus is on the relationship between the price of *new commercial housing per square meter*, the fixed budget proportion for this housing, and the conclusion of an increased overall budget.

The argument states: a 25% increase in the price of new commercial housing per square meter, coupled with an unchanged budget proportion for this housing, means the average family budget must have increased by 25%. This assumes the quantity of housing purchased remained constant.
Let's break down the choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the core assumption. If families buy the same square footage at a higher price, their total housing cost increases proportionally. For the budget proportion for housing to remain constant, the overall budget must also increase proportionally.
* **B, C, and D:** These are irrelevant to the argument's core logic. The argument focuses narrowly on:
    * The price of *new commercial housing per square meter*

The argument links a 25% increase in the price of new commercial housing per square meter to a 25% increase in the average family budget. This link holds only if the amount of housing purchased remains constant.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the essential assumption. If the purchased area is constant, a 25% price increase per square meter directly translates to a 25% increase in total housing cost.  To keep the budget proportion for housing the same, the overall budget must also increase by 25%.
* **B, C, and D:** These are irrelevant to the core logic. The argument focuses specifically on:
    - The price of *new commercial housing per square meter*.
    - The fixed budget proportion allocated to this housing.
    - The conclusion that the overall family budget must have increased.

The argument claims that because the price of commercial housing per square meter increased by 25% and the proportion of the family budget spent on this housing remained the same, the average family budget must have increased by 25%. This hinges on the assumption that families continued to purchase the same amount of housing space.
Let's look at the choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the crucial assumption. If the area purchased remains constant while the price per square meter increases, the total cost of housing increases proportionally. To maintain the same budget proportion for housing, the overall budget must also increase proportionally.
* **B, C, and D:** These are distractions. The argument focuses solely on:
    - The price of *new commercial housing per square meter*.
    - The unchanging budget proportion dedicated to this specific housing.

The argument states that a 25% increase in the price of new commercial housing per square meter, coupled with a constant budget proportion for this housing, means the average family budget must have risen by 25%. This only holds true if the amount of housing purchased stayed the same.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: On average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.** This is the fundamental assumption. If families purchase the same square footage at a higher price, their total housing expenses increase proportionally. To maintain the same budget proportion for housing, the overall budget must also rise proportionally.
* **B, C, and D:** These are irrelevant. The argument's focus is very specific:
    - It's about the price of *new commercial housing per square meter*, not other goods or overall housing costs.
    - It's about the fixed budget *proportion* dedicated to this housing, not the absolute amounts spent on housing or other categories.

* **Saxophonist:** The saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. This means the saxophonist cannot be third, as either the percussionist or trumpeter would need to be before them, and the other would need to be after them.

* **B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.**  This directly contradicts the idea that viewers were swayed by Lopez's victory. It indicates they found Tanner more convincing, weakening the argument that their opinions were based on the election result.
* **C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.** This is interesting, but it doesn't directly address the potential bias in the post-debate survey results. It's possible viewers found Tanner more persuasive in the debate (as option B suggests) but other factors influenced their final vote.
* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.** While this shows initial support for Tanner, it doesn't rule out the possibility that viewers were influenced by Lopez's win when evaluating the debate afterward.
* **E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.** A close election result doesn't change the possibility that viewers' opinions of the debate were colored by their knowledge of Lopez's victory.

* **A:** The passage focuses on the method's limitations in understanding mental processes, not its medical validity.
* **B:** The subtractive method's results actually contradict Uttal's view, making this incorrect.
* **C:** The passage uses anger as a critique of the modular theory in general, not specifically about anger brain scans.
* **D:** This is the best fit. The author argues the method creates an illusion of localized functions, making the modular theory seem more plausible.
* **E:** The passage acknowledges the method shows differential oxygen use, making this incorrect.
The most likely answer is **D**.

The passage emphasizes a sense of evolution and development in Schoenberg's music, not abrupt shifts:
* **Late-Romantic to Atonal:** Schoenberg ""pushed those unstable harmonies,"" suggesting a continuation and exploration of the late-Romantic style rather than a complete abandonment. The author even refers to this as the ""next inevitable step.""
* **Atonal to 12-Tone:** The 12-tone technique is presented as a means to bring ""order"" to atonality, a logical progression building upon the previous style.

* **B: Tocqueville believes that an individual's economic class should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that class is not a legitimate consideration.**  Neither passage focuses heavily on economic class as a primary factor in societal position. While relevant to the era, it's not their central argument.
* **C: Tocqueville believes that an individual's temperament should determine that individual's position, while Mill believes that temperament should not be a factor in an individual's position.**  Temperament is not explicitly discussed by either author. While Tocqueville might see it linked to his ""different characteristics"" argument, it's not his primary focus.
* **D: Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by what is most beneficial to society, while Mill believes it should be determined by what an individual finds most rewarding.**  While Tocqueville might frame his argument in terms of societal benefit, his core belief lies in the inherent differences between sexes dictating roles. Mill, however, focuses on individual liberty and merit, not solely societal benefit or personal reward.

The passage states, ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory: as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too, and trembling gradually into full consciousness.""

The passage explicitly connects Eppie's development with Silas's increasing engagement with the world around him. 
For example:
* ""As the child's mind was growing into knowledge, his mind was growing into memory""
* ""as her life unfolded, his soul, long stupefied in a cold narrow prison, was unfolding too""
Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:
* **A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.** While both are present, the passage emphasizes the *growth* and positive change in both.
* **C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.** This is incorrect. Silas's focus on wealth is diminished by Eppie's presence.
* **D: physical growth and Silas's painful perception of his own mortality.**  The passage doesn't focus on Silas's mortality.

Let's analyze why the other choices are not the best fit:
* **A: physical vulnerability and Silas's emotional fragility.** While both might be present, the emphasis is on their positive growth, not just vulnerability.
* **C: boundless energy and Silas's insatiable desire for wealth.** This is incorrect. Eppie's presence actually shifts Silas's focus away from wealth.

3. To get rid of the fractions, multiply both sides of the equation by (x-3) and keep in mind multiplying by zero:  (x-3)* x/(x-3) = x(x-3), this implies x=x(x-3)  and  x-3!=0, so x!=3
4. Distribute on the right side: x = x^2 - 3x
5. Move all terms to one side: 0 = x^2 - 4x 
6. Factor out an x: 0 = x(x-4)
7. For this product to equal zero, either x = 0 or (x-4) = 0

While K-pop incorporates various elements, a violin solo isn't a typical element within a K-pop performance. 
Let's analyze the other options:
* **A: stretches before his performance.**  Plausible, performers often warm up.
* **B: is doing a routine on a black pit stage.**  Common in K-pop, black pit stages enhance visual effects.
* **C: gets to the stage first and begins singing is of his high country.** This seems out of place for a K-pop concert.
Considering typical K-pop elements, option B, a routine on a black pit stage, aligns best with a K-pop performance.

* **C: gets to the stage first and begins singing is of his high country.** This seems out of place for a K-pop concert and has grammatical errors.
* **D: is playing the violin while the audience cheers and claps for him.** While not the most common K-pop instrument, violin solos can happen, and this option creates a vivid scene.

This is a complex case where a woman is experiencing recurrent second-trimester losses.  Here's a breakdown of why choosing the most likely cause is crucial:
* **Recurrent Miscarriages:** Two second-trimester losses suggest a potential underlying issue that needs to be identified.
* **Timing:** Second-trimester losses can be linked to uterine factors, cervical insufficiency, or genetic abnormalities. 
While all the options could provide useful information, here's why **D: Chromosomal Abnormalities** is the most important to consider first:
* **Genetic Factors:** Chromosomal abnormalities in either parent can increase the risk of miscarriage, often in the second trimester. 
* **Guiding Further Investigation:**  Understanding if a genetic component exists is crucial. If chromosomal abnormalities are ruled out, then investigations like hysteroscopy can be pursued.
**Therefore, starting with chromosomal analysis will help guide the most effective management plan.**

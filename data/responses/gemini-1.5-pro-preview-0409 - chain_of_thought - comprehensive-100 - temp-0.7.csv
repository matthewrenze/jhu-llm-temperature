1. **Neither Vacation:** 20% fall outside both circles. This leaves 80% within the two circles.
2. **Winter AND Summer:** 40% are in the overlapping section.
3. **Winter ONLY:** Since 75% take a winter vacation, and 40% take both, then 35% take ONLY a winter vacation (75% - 40% = 35%).
4. **Summer ONLY:** We know 80% take either a winter or summer vacation. We've accounted for 35% (winter only) and 40% (both). This leaves 5% who must take ONLY a summer vacation (80% - 35% - 40% = 5%).
**Therefore, 5% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.**

The researchers are suggesting a major meteorite impact occurred in what is now Quebec, about 215 million years ago. Their evidence: meteorites of that age and a clay layer with unusually high levels of iridium and platinum. We need to pick the statement that best strengthens this claim.
Let's analyze the options:
* **A:** This describes the rock's formation process but doesn't directly relate to a meteorite impact.
* **B:**  This states that a mass extinction, which included ammonites, happened around 200-237 million years ago. This timeframe aligns with the proposed impact. Since large impacts can cause mass extinctions, this strongly supports the researchers' findings.

The core of the argument is whether writing as a discipline is sufficiently rigorous and developed to warrant masters and doctoral programs.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major?** This addresses the popularity of such a program, not its academic validity.
* **B: Do we have the qualifications for the faculty and subject research in writing to recruit masters and doctors?**  This directly questions the core issue of whether the field of writing is developed enough to support graduate-level study. 
* **C: Have we applied for masters and Ph.Ds in other applied and technical disciplines other than writing?** This focuses on other disciplines and doesn't assess the validity of writing as a field of study.
* **D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines?** This is a broader question about applied disciplines in general and doesn't specifically target the argument about writing.

The argument presented seems flawed from the start. It states that other countries have master's and doctoral programs in writing and uses that as a reason to question why ""we"" are still calling for the right to award these degrees. This implies ""we"" don't already have them, creating a confusing contradiction. 
Because of this inherent contradiction, it's difficult to assess the argument's rationality directly. However, we can focus on the implied concern: whether writing deserves to be considered a field for advanced academic study like ""applied and technical disciplines.""
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major?**  This is irrelevant to the core argument about the academic merit of writing as a field of study.
* **B: Do we have the qualifications for the faculty and subject research in writing to recruit masters and doctors?**  This directly questions if ""we"" have the infrastructure and expertise to support high-level study in writing, making it relevant to the argument's core.

The argument is poorly constructed and contradictory. It claims other countries have established writing programs at the masters and doctoral levels, yet implies ""we"" are still fighting for the basic ""right"" to offer such degrees. This suggests ""we"" *don't* have these programs, making the comparison illogical.
However, hidden within the flawed structure is a comparison between ""writing"" and ""applied and technical disciplines."" This implies a belief that writing might *not* deserve the same level of academic recognition. To assess the argument's rationality, we must address this unstated assumption.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: If we are allowed to recruit masters and doctors in writing, how many people will apply for this major?**  This focuses on student interest, not the validity of the field itself.

* **D: Should we pay attention to the cultivation of master's degree and doctoral degree in applied and technical disciplines?** This is too broad. It promotes applied fields in general without addressing the specific comparison to writing.
None of the choices perfectly address the core issue: **Can writing, as a field of study, be rigorous and worthy of advanced academic pursuit like applied and technical disciplines?**

The context presents an exaggerated claim: attending Oxford University makes you so skeptical, you'll NEVER believe ANYTHING anyone says. We need to determine which statement CANNOT be true if this exaggeration were actually true.
Let's look at the choices:
* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.**  This aligns with the exaggeration, implying not even Einstein is trusted.
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This directly contradicts the exaggeration's core idea. The exaggeration says NO belief is possible, while this suggests SOME belief remains. 
* **C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.** This reinforces the exaggeration, highlighting total disbelief.
* **D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.**  This also fits the exaggeration, though less extreme than C.
Since the question emphasizes the exaggeration, the most logically incompatible statement is the one that allows for any belief to continue after attending Oxford.

The context describes an exaggeration: Attending Oxford University makes you so skeptical that you'll NEVER believe anything ANYONE says. Our task is to identify the statement that CANNOT be true if this exaggeration were actually true.
Let's analyze the options:
* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.** This statement aligns with the exaggeration, showing that even a renowned figure like Einstein wouldn't be exempt from disbelief.
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This option directly contradicts the exaggeration. The exaggeration claims NO belief is possible after Oxford, while this statement suggests SOME belief can still exist. 
* **C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.** This reinforces the exaggeration, emphasizing total and complete disbelief.
* **D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.** This statement also fits within the exaggeration, although it's slightly less extreme than option C.
Because the question stresses the exaggeration, the most logically incompatible statement is the one that allows for the continuation of any belief after attending Oxford.

The context sets up an exaggerated scenario: attending Oxford University makes you so incredibly skeptical that you wouldn't believe anything anyone said, ever again. We need to find the statement that CANNOT be true if this exaggeration were actually factual.
Let's break down the choices:
* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.**  This choice aligns with the exaggeration. It suggests that even a brilliant mind like Einstein wouldn't be considered trustworthy.
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This is the opposite of the exaggeration. The exaggeration claims you'll NEVER believe ANYTHING, while this option says you could still believe SOME things.
* **C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.** This choice takes the exaggeration even further, emphasizing a complete and total lack of belief.
* **D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.**  This option also fits within the exaggeration, although it's not as extreme as choice C.
The question wants us to focus on the exaggeration.  Because of this, the most logically inconsistent statement is the one that allows for any possibility of belief after attending Oxford.

We're given an exaggeration: attending Oxford University makes you SO skeptical that you'll NEVER believe ANYTHING anyone says, ever.  Our goal is to figure out which statement CANNOT be true if this exaggeration was actually true.
Let's examine the options:
* **A: If you have been to Oxford University, you can never believe any words that Einstein said.** This aligns perfectly with the exaggeration. Even a genius like Einstein isn't safe from your Oxford-trained skepticism!
* **B: You have been to Oxford University, but sometimes you may still believe what some people say.** This directly clashes with the exaggeration. The exaggeration says NO belief is possible after Oxford, but this option says you might still believe SOME things.
* **C: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe any words that anyone said.** This choice doubles down on the exaggeration, making it clear that you'll disbelieve EVERYTHING.
* **D: If you have been to Oxford University, you will no longer believe what some people say.**  Similar to C, this fits with the exaggeration, though it's not as extreme.
The question wants us to focus on the exaggeration.  Therefore, the most logically incompatible statement is the one that allows for any belief to survive after you've experienced Oxford.

A: **Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson** -  This violates the rule of assigning a photographer to only one ceremony. 
B: **Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck** - This option seems possible. Frost and Heideck are assigned together. As Gonzalez is at Silva, Lai would be at Thorne, leaving space for another photographer at Silva. 
C: **Gonzalez, Knutson** - If Gonzalez is at Silva, Lai must be at Thorne, leaving only one photographer at Silva.
D: **Heideck, Lai** - This violates the rule that Frost and Heideck must be together.

A: **Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson** - This choice breaks the rule of assigning one photographer to only one ceremony.
B: **Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck** - This option ticks a few boxes: Frost and Heideck are together. Since Gonzalez is at Silva, Lai has to be at Thorne. However, this leaves Silva short of one photographer to meet the minimum requirement.
C: **Gonzalez, Knutson** - With Gonzalez at Silva, Lai is required to be at Thorne. This leaves only one photographer at Silva, not fulfilling the minimum requirement.

  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, and no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, and Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of wall 3.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so we now need to determine which of the remaining paintings should be displayed with it.
  Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, and Isaacs's watercolor is already displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only remaining option for wall 2 is Hidalgo's oil.
  This leaves Franz's watercolor, Greene's oil, and Hidalgo's watercolor to be displayed on walls 1 and 4.
  Since Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 3, and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as either Franz's watercolor or Hidalgo's watercolor.

2. **Eliminate A and B:** Choices A (F, M) and B (F, H, M) contain only two books each, so they cannot be the complete list for the bottom shelf.
3. **K's Position:** K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Since the bottom shelf is the lowest, K cannot be on it. This eliminates choice C (G, H, K).
4. **L and O:** O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means L cannot be on the top shelf, as there would be no higher shelf for O.
5. **Deduction:** We know F and M are on the same shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf. To accommodate at least three books on the bottom shelf, the most likely scenario is F, M, and L residing there.
6. **Eliminate D:** Choice D (F, G, M, O) includes O, which cannot be on the same shelf as L. 
7. **Closest Fit:**  While none of the choices perfectly represent the deduction that F, M, and L must be on the bottom shelf, option E (G, H, L, M) is the closest. It includes L and allows for F and M to also be on the bottom shelf.

1. **Minimum on Bottom Shelf:** The bottom shelf has more books than the top, and each shelf has at least two. This means the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
2. **Eliminate Small Options:** Choices A (F, M) and B (F, H, M) only have two books, so they cannot be the full bottom shelf.
3. **K's Placement:** K is above F. Since the bottom shelf is the lowest, K cannot be there, eliminating choice C (G, H, K).
4. **L and O's Positions:** O is above L, meaning L cannot be on the top shelf (no room for O above it).
5. **Logical Deduction:** F and M are together, and L can't be on top. To fit at least three books on the bottom, the most likely scenario is F, M, and L together there.
6. **Discarding D:** Choice D (F, G, M, O) has O, which can't be with L (from step 4).
7. **Choosing the Best Fit:** No option perfectly reflects F, M, and L on the bottom. However, E (G, H, L, M) is the closest as it includes L and allows for F and M to be there as well.

Let's analyze the choices:

* **C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.**  This is irrelevant to the argument.

* **A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.**  This actually strengthens the argument.

* **A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.** This strengthens the argument. If most voters didn't watch the debate, then those surveyed (who did watch) are even MORE likely to be influenced by the election result when forming their opinions.
* **B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.**  **This is the most direct counter to the argument.** Live viewers wouldn't know the election outcome yet, so their preference for Tanner suggests Lopez's debate performance wasn't inherently seen as superior, challenging the idea that the post-election survey reflects genuine opinion.
* **C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.** This is irrelevant to the argument. The focus is on how knowing the election winner might influence opinions on the debate, not on the voting patterns of debate viewers.
* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.**  This actually strengthens the argument. If viewers favored Tanner beforehand, then Lopez's win would be even more surprising, making the positive post-debate survey results even more suspicious as potentially influenced by the unexpected outcome.
* **E: Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin.** The margin of victory is irrelevant. The argument hinges on whether knowing the winner influences the perception of the debate performance, not how close the race was.
**Therefore, the answer is B.** It directly contradicts the idea that knowing Lopez won the election is the reason people view their debate performance favorably.

The columnist finds diverting the surcharge from the dam to roads unacceptable. This implies a strong connection between the surcharge and the dam project.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A:** Transparency is important for utilities, but it doesn't explain *why* the columnist objects to the legislator's proposal.
* **B:**  Both a dam (water supply) and roads can be seen as benefiting the entire community. This choice misses the central point.
* **C:** We don't know if the dam is unpopular. The passage simply states an alternative spending proposal exists.
* **D:** The utility already has approval for the surcharge, rendering this choice irrelevant.
* **E:** This principle directly links the surcharge to water-related spending.  A dam clearly fits, while roads do not. This strongly supports the columnist's argument.

The columnist believes that using the money from the additional charge on water bills for roads instead of the dam is unacceptable. This suggests that the columnist thinks the surcharge is directly linked to building the dam.
Let's look at the choices:
* **A:**  While customers should know how their money is being used, this doesn't explain why the columnist thinks the legislator's proposal is wrong.
* **B:** This argument is weak because both the dam (for water supply) and roads benefit the entire community. 
* **C:** The passage doesn't say that the dam is unpopular.  It simply states that an alternative proposal exists.
* **D:** The passage states that the utility has already received approval for the surcharge, so this point is irrelevant.
* **E:** This choice directly connects the additional charge on water bills to spending on things related to water. A dam would fit into this category, while roads would not.  This option strongly supports the columnist's stance.

The argument attempts to refute the classification of H. pylori as a commensal by comparing it to M. tuberculosis. The author argues that because M. tuberculosis isn't considered a commensal despite only a small percentage getting sick, neither should H. pylori. 
To weaken this argument, we need to find a difference between the two that makes H. pylori more likely to be beneficial than M. tuberculosis, despite both having the potential to cause harm.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.**  The existence of treatments doesn't affect whether a bacteria is inherently beneficial or harmful to its host. This is irrelevant to the commensalism argument.
* **B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.**  This actually strengthens the argument *against* H. pylori being a commensal. If tuberculosis is a longer-lasting and potentially more serious illness, it reinforces the idea that any degree of harm is enough to disqualify a bacterium from being considered beneficial.
* **C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.** This also strengthens the argument *against* H. pylori being a commensal. If M. tuberculosis has no positive effects on its host, it supports the comparison and the idea that any harm, regardless of how infrequent, negates any potential benefits.
* **D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.** This is irrelevant to the argument. The prevalence of either bacteria doesn't determine whether it has a commensal relationship with its host. 
* **E: There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis.**  This is also irrelevant. Commensalism depends on the specific interaction between the bacteria and the host, not how common the bacteria is.
**None of the choices directly undermine the argument.** We must choose the answer that least helps the argument against H. pylori being a commensal.

The argument's main point is that H. pylori shouldn't be considered a commensal because it can cause harm, just like M. tuberculosis. The author emphasizes that even though both only cause illness in a minority of carriers, neither deserves the commensal label. 
To weaken this reasoning, we need to find a significant difference between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis that makes H. pylori more likely to be beneficial despite its potential to cause ulcers. 
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.**  The availability of treatment doesn't change the fundamental relationship between the bacteria and humans. It's irrelevant to whether the bacteria is beneficial or harmful in the context of commensalism.
* **B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.**  This actually strengthens the argument *against* H. pylori being a commensal. A longer-lasting illness like tuberculosis is generally considered more serious and harmful, making the comparison used in the argument even stronger.
* **C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.**  This strengthens the argument *against* H. pylori being a commensal.  If M. tuberculosis offers no benefits to its host, it supports the comparison and reinforces the idea that any harm, regardless of how infrequent, outweighs potential benefits.
* **D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.** The prevalence of either bacteria is irrelevant in determining whether they have a commensal relationship with their host.  Commensalism depends on the nature of the relationship, not how common it is.

* **B:** Cars must have engines and transmissions (primary) to function. Features like paint and taillights (secondary) are not essential for driving but offer benefits: protection against rust, increased safety, and signaling. **This is the most fitting analogy.** The primary components are crucial for basic operation, while the secondary components provide additional, non-essential yet advantageous features.
* **C:** Mechanical components (primary) are essential for a factory, and electrical components (secondary) power the machinery. This analogy doesn't quite align. Electricity is necessary to *power* the essential functions, not provide a distinct, advantageous function like secondary substances do. 
* **D:** This option describes components *within* a single system (brakes) and doesn't illustrate the essential vs. non-essential element comparison we're looking for.
* **E:**  This analogy deals with storage locations (internal vs. external) for software, not different types of components with distinct roles like we see with primary and secondary substances.
**Answer:** Choice B provides the most accurate analogy: essential components for basic operation (primary) and non-essential elements that provide additional benefits (secondary).

To find the best analogy, we need to clearly understand the roles of primary and secondary substances in plants:
* **Primary substances:** These are *essential* for the plant's fundamental life functions – growth, metabolism, etc. They are non-negotiable for the plant's very survival.
* **Secondary substances:** These are not essential for basic survival but offer *additional* evolutionary advantages. They might deter predators, attract pollinators, or provide other benefits that enhance the plant's ability to thrive.
Let's look at the choices:
* **A:** Hospitals need electricity (primary), and generators (secondary) provide backup power. Generators simply *replace* the primary function when there's an outage. This doesn't match the distinct, beneficial role of secondary substances in plants.
* **B:** Cars need engines and transmissions (primary) to run.  Paint and taillights (secondary), while not essential for driving, offer additional benefits: they prevent rust, enhance safety, and provide visual signaling. **This analogy is the most accurate.** The primary components are essential for basic function, and the secondary components provide extra, non-essential yet advantageous features.
* **C:** Mechanical components (primary) are essential in a factory, and electrical components (secondary) provide power. This analogy falls short. Electricity powers the essential functions but doesn't offer a separate, beneficial role like secondary substances in plants.
* **D:** This option describes components *within* a single system (brakes), not two distinct categories of components with separate, essential vs. non-essential roles.
* **E:** This analogy focuses on storage locations for software, not different types of components with distinct functions like we see in the plant example.

The passage states that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different musical styles. It mentions that he started with late-Romantic, then moved to unstable harmonies without a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique. This evolution suggests a natural progression from one style to the next.
The passage also states that Schoenberg felt that moving to unstable harmonies was ""the next inevitable step in the historical development of music."" This further supports the idea of a natural progression between the styles.

The passage explains that consumers tend to support the ""underdog""—the smaller brand facing a large competitor. The question, however, examines the reverse: What happens when a *large* bookstore emphasizes its *small* competitors? 
It's unlikely that simply mentioning smaller competitors would significantly damage the large bookstore. Customers are not likely to switch their loyalty merely because they are reminded of smaller options.
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.** This is improbable. Highlighting smaller competition wouldn't directly improve customer perception of the large store.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.** This is the most plausible outcome. By mentioning smaller bookstores, the large store might subtly highlight its wider selection and variety, attracting customers who prioritize those factors. 
* **C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.** This is too vague and doesn't directly align with the passage. The focus is on supporting the smaller competitor, not a general preference for heightened competition.
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.** This contradicts the research. The study shows customers supporting the *smaller* competitor, not flocking to the larger one when smaller options are emphasized.
**Therefore, the most logical answer is B.**

The passage focuses on the phenomenon where consumers tend to favor the ""underdog,"" meaning the smaller business facing competition from a larger one. This question, however, presents the opposite scenario: What happens when a *large* bookstore highlights its *small* competitors?
It's unlikely that simply mentioning smaller competitors would cause significant harm to the large bookstore. Customers are not likely to suddenly switch their loyalty simply because they're reminded of smaller alternatives.
Let's break down the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.** This is improbable. Highlighting smaller bookstores wouldn't directly impact the customer experience at the larger store.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.**  This is the most plausible outcome. By mentioning smaller bookstores, the large store might subtly draw attention to its own wider selection and greater variety, which could attract customers who value those factors.
* **C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.** This is too general and doesn't align with the passage's findings. The passage focuses on consumer support for the *smaller* competitor, not a general preference for increased competition.
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.** This contradicts the study's results. The research shows that customers tend to support the *smaller* competitor when they are aware of the competition, not flock to the larger one.

The passage describes a ""David and Goliath"" effect where consumers tend to support smaller businesses, especially when they perceive them as being threatened by larger corporations.  This question, however, asks about the impact on a *large* bookstore when it draws attention to its *small* competitors.
The study doesn't directly address this scenario. It's unlikely that simply highlighting smaller competitors would cause significant harm to the large bookstore. Customers probably wouldn't abandon the large store just because they're reminded of smaller options.
Let's consider the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.**  This is unlikely.  Highlighting smaller competitors doesn't directly impact customer satisfaction with the larger store.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.** This is the most plausible outcome. By mentioning smaller bookstores, the large store might subtly emphasize its own wider selection and variety, potentially attracting customers who value those factors.
* **C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.** This is too vague. The study focuses on customers supporting the *underdog*, not a general preference for increased market competition.
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.**  This contradicts the study's findings. The research indicates that customers tend to rally *against* the larger competitor, not in favor of it, when smaller competitors are highlighted.

The study demonstrates a ""David vs. Goliath"" effect, where consumers tend to support the smaller business, especially when they see it as being threatened by a larger corporation.  This question, however, flips the script and asks about the impact on a *large* bookstore when it emphasizes its *small* competitors.
The passage doesn't directly address this. However, it's logical to conclude that merely highlighting smaller competitors wouldn't significantly hurt the large bookstore.  Customers are unlikely to switch their loyalty just because they are reminded of smaller options.

The passage discusses how consumers often root for the ""underdog,"" choosing to support smaller businesses, especially when they perceive them as threatened by larger ones. This question, however, presents the opposite scenario: What if a *large* bookstore highlights its *small* competitors?
While the study doesn't directly address this, it's unlikely that simply mentioning smaller competitors would significantly hurt the large bookstore. Customers are unlikely to switch their preference just because they are reminded of smaller options.
Let's examine the answer choices:
* **A: receive more positive reviews from its customers.** This is improbable. Highlighting smaller competitors doesn't relate to the large bookstore's service or products.
* **B: gain customers who perceive it as offering more choices than smaller shops.** This is the most plausible outcome. When smaller bookstores are mentioned, the larger store might indirectly highlight its own wider selection and variety, potentially attracting customers who prioritize those factors.
* **C: benefit from people's perception that its competition is now even greater.** This is too vague and not directly supported by the passage. The study emphasizes supporting the *smaller* competitor, not a general desire for increased market competition.
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.** This goes against the study's findings. The research suggests customers tend to rally *against* the larger competitor, not for it, when smaller competitors are highlighted.

* **A:** This attempts to describe pulling the braid back and securing it, but uses confusing and incorrect phrasing (""bryls,"" ""kick her hair"").
* **B:** This is illogical. It's unlikely someone would stop mid-braid to show it off while still actively adding in hair.
* **C:** This option introduces elements completely unrelated to the scenario. The text describes a basic braid, not one involving pre-existing knots or ""flipped hair.""
* **D:** This option is grammatically incorrect and doesn't make sense in the given context.
Since we *must* select a choice, **A** is the *least* illogical, even with its flawed phrasing. It attempts to describe a plausible next step in braiding, moving the braid towards the back of the head.

  * **Endometrial Biopsy:** This focuses on the uterine lining and is more relevant for investigating bleeding disorders or implantation issues, not as much for recurrent second-trimester losses.
  * **Chromosomal Abnormalities:**  While important in recurrent miscarriages, they are more often associated with first-trimester losses. 
Action: Answer(""B"")

Two second-trimester abortions is a concerning history that necessitates a thorough investigation. Here's a breakdown of the options and why one stands out:
* **Chromosomal abnormalities:** While often associated with first-trimester losses, they can contribute to pregnancy loss at any stage.  Considering the potential impact on future pregnancies, checking for chromosomal abnormalities in both partners is a crucial first step. This might involve karyotyping or genetic testing.
Here's why the other options are less likely to be the *initial* investigation, though they might be considered later:
* **Hysteroscopy:** This allows direct visualization of the uterine cavity and is essential in evaluating for uterine factors, but addressing potential genetic factors often takes precedence. 
* **TVS (Transvaginal Ultrasound):** Provides useful information about the reproductive organs but doesn't reveal chromosomal abnormalities.
* **Endometrial Biopsy:** Assesses the uterine lining and is less likely to be the primary focus in this particular scenario.
**Therefore, the most appropriate next investigation would be:**

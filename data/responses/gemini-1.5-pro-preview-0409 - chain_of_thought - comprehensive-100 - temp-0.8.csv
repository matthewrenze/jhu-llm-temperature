The researchers are using the presence of meteorites, a clay layer rich in iridium and platinum, and other minerals to support their claim of a meteorite impact around 215 million years ago. We need to identify the statement that most strongly links their evidence to a meteorite impact.
Option C directly establishes that link:
* It states that elements like iridium and platinum are ""peculiar to meteorites"" - meaning they are distinctive and characteristic of meteorites.
* It emphasizes that these elements are normally found only in ""trace amounts"" on Earth's surface. Therefore, their unusually high concentration in this location strongly suggests they came from an external source like a meteorite.
This direct connection between high concentrations of iridium and platinum and meteorite impacts makes Option C the strongest supporting evidence.
Let's analyze why the other options are less relevant:
* **A:**  Focuses on the geological formation of the rock but doesn't explain the presence of elements typically linked to meteorites. 
* **B:** Mentions a relevant timeframe and a mass extinction, but it doesn't directly connect them to a meteorite impact *in this specific location*. Other events could have caused the extinction.
* **D:** Acknowledges that meteorite impacts have occurred throughout Earth's history but doesn't offer specific support for this particular instance.
**Therefore, Option C offers the most direct and relevant support for the research findings.**

The researchers found meteorites, a clay layer rich in iridium and platinum, and specific minerals, all pointing towards a meteorite impact around 215 million years ago.  We need to choose the statement that best strengthens the link between their evidence and meteorite impacts.
Option C is the most relevant because it directly connects the unusual presence of iridium and platinum to meteorites:
* It states that these elements are ""peculiar to meteorites,"" making them distinct indicators of a meteorite's presence. 
* It emphasizes that these elements usually exist only in ""trace amounts"" on Earth, making their high concentration in this location significant.
This direct link between high concentrations of iridium and platinum and meteorite impacts makes Option C the strongest supporting evidence.
Let's consider why the other options are less relevant:
* **A:** Explains the rock's formation process but doesn't address the significant finding of elements linked to meteorites.
* **B:** While mentioning a relevant timeframe and a mass extinction event, it doesn't directly connect them to a meteorite impact *in this specific location*. Other factors could have contributed to the extinction.
* **D:**  Acknowledges that meteorites have hit Earth in the past but doesn't offer specific support for this particular event.

The researchers are proposing that a large meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada, based on their findings: 200 million-year-old meteorites, high concentrations of iridium and platinum, and specific minerals. We need to choose the statement that best strengthens the connection between this evidence and meteorite impacts. 
Option C directly establishes that connection:
* It highlights that iridium and platinum are ""peculiar to meteorites"" - meaning these elements are distinctive characteristics of meteorites.
* It points out that these elements are usually found only in ""trace amounts"" on Earth's surface. This fact makes their high concentration in this specific location very significant. 
This direct link between the unusually high concentrations of iridium and platinum and the presence of meteorites makes Option C the strongest supporting evidence for the researchers' claim.
Here's why the other choices are less supportive:
* **A:** Focuses on the rock's formation process, which doesn't directly explain the presence of elements characteristic of meteorites.
* **B:** While mentioning a relevant timeframe (Late Paleozoic Triassic) and a mass extinction event, it doesn't create a direct link to a meteorite impact *at this specific location*. Other factors could have caused the extinction.
* **D:**  States that meteorite impacts have occurred throughout Earth's history but doesn't offer specific support for this particular event.

* If Y accompanies F and L, it directly contradicts condition (1). If X accompanies F, then W must accompany L, and vice-versa. Y cannot accompany both.
* **Therefore, option C is impossible.**
**D: F and M**
* Assuming Y accompanies F and M:
    * Due to condition (2), X is forced to accompany G (since Y is not with M).
    * This leaves W to accompany both L and K, again violating condition (4).
* **Therefore, option D is impossible.**
**Conclusion**
We've found that all the options (A, B, C, and D) violate the given conditions, making them impossible scenarios. However, option A (G and H) stands out because it directly contradicts a given condition without requiring additional deductions.

The argument presents a correlation between the arrival of humans and the extinction of large mammals in North America, concluding causation. This is a classic fallacy.
Option **D** directly addresses this weakness by pointing out that the evidence (climate warming) supports two possibilities:

Let's analyze each choice and see if it fits the given constraints:
* **A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson** 
    * Violates the constraint: No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies (since we need at least two photographers at each ceremony, and there are only six in total).
* **B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck**
    * Satisfies the constraint: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck.
    * Doesn't violate the constraint: If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies (since neither is in this assignment).
    * Satisfies the constraint: If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony (since Lai is not assigned here).
    * Doesn't violate the constraint: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it (since this assignment doesn't involve Knutson).

Let's analyze the restrictions to see who cannot be the third performer:
1. **Guitarist:** Can't be fourth, but could be third - doesn't violate any rules.
2. **Keyboard player:**  Must be after violinist and before guitarist. If third, the violinist and guitarist would have to be 1st and 2nd, which is possible.
3. **Saxophonist:** Must be after EITHER percussionist OR trumpeter.  If third, one of those two must be second, leaving no space for the violinist before the keyboard player. This violates a restriction.
4. **Trumpeter:** Could be third without violating any rules - placement is flexible.
5. **Violinist:** Must be before the keyboard player. If third, the keyboard player would have to be 4th or later, leaving no room for the guitarist before the 4th slot. This violates a restriction. 
Therefore, the saxophonist and the violinist cannot be the third performer.

The argument suggests that viewers' positive perception of Lopez's debate performance might be because they knew Lopez won the election, implying a bias. We need to find an answer choice that weakens this connection between perceived debate performance and the election result.
Let's analyze each choice:
* **A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.**  This actually strengthens the argument. If most voters didn't watch the debate, the viewers' opinions wouldn't be representative of the overall electorate, making the bias claim more plausible. 
* **B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.**  This choice directly contradicts the premise that viewers found Lopez's arguments better. However, it doesn't address the potential bias stemming from knowledge of the election outcome.

The core of the argument is this: because the potential penalty for the pollution is so severe, a higher standard of evidence is needed to justify imposing it. The argument implies that less severe penalties might not require such a high burden of proof.
Let's examine the answer choices:
* **A:** This choice directly connects the severity of a penalty with the level of certainty required to justify its use. This aligns perfectly with the argument's line of reasoning.
* **B:**  This discusses the desired balance when setting penalties (deterrence vs. willingness to enforce). While important, it doesn't directly address the core issue of the relationship between a penalty's severity and the level of certainty needed to justify its application.
* **C:** This choice focuses on the principle of proportionality between the penalty and the harm caused.  While relevant to legal frameworks, it doesn't address the central point of the argument about certainty and severe penalties.
* **D:** This option points out the potential negative impact of severe penalties on confessions. However, the argument's focus isn't on encouraging confessions, but on the level of certainty required to justify a severe penalty.
* **E:**  While this touches on the idea of certainty in punishment, it fails to make the explicit connection between the severity of the penalty and the required level of certainty, which is the crux of the argument.

The argument hinges on the comparison between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis, claiming that just because both bacteria can exist without always causing disease, it doesn't make them commensal. To weaken this argument, we need to find a factor that differentiates H. pylori from M. tuberculosis in a way that challenges the comparison.
Let's analyze choice C:
* **C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.**  This statement highlights a crucial difference. The argument mentions H. pylori *allegedly* strengthens the immune system, indicating a potential benefit for the host. If M. tuberculosis doesn't offer any such benefit, the comparison loses its ground. This directly undermines the argument's logic because it relies on the flawed assumption that both bacteria are comparable in their lack of benefit to the host. 
Let's examine why the other choices don't effectively weaken the argument:
* **A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.** The availability of treatment for the diseases caused by the bacteria doesn't determine whether those bacteria offer other benefits to the host.
* **B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.** The duration of illnesses caused by these bacteria doesn't determine their potential benefits or overall impact on the host.
* **D: There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori.** The prevalence of a bacterium in the population doesn't necessarily correlate to its benefits or risks for the host.

The argument against classifying H. pylori as a commensal bacterium relies on comparing it to M. tuberculosis. It asserts that just because both bacteria don't always cause illness, it doesn't automatically make them commensal. To undermine this argument, we need to identify a key difference between H. pylori and M. tuberculosis that invalidates this comparison. 
Let's consider choice C:
* **C: People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.** This statement reveals a critical flaw in the argument's logic. While H. pylori *allegedly* strengthens the immune response, which could be beneficial, M. tuberculosis offers no such benefit according to this choice. This distinction in potential benefits dismantles the comparison the argument relies on. The argument assumes both bacteria are similar in their lack of benefit, but choice C disproves this.
Let's analyze why the other options are less effective:
* **A: Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics.**  The existence of treatment options for the illnesses caused by the bacteria doesn't have a bearing on whether those bacteria might offer other benefits to the host. 
* **B: Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori.** The duration of illnesses caused by these bacteria doesn't directly correlate to their potential benefits or overall impact on the host.

We need to determine the core difference in how the two authors view an individual's place in society.
* **Tocqueville:**  Believes men and women have ""wide differences"" and should have ""distinct employment"" of their faculties. This suggests he finds an individual's sex as key to their societal role.

The passage states that highlighting a large competitor's size can help smaller brands because it makes consumers more likely to support the smaller brand. If customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's *small* competitors, it would likely have the opposite effect, making the large store seem less appealing in comparison. 
The most likely result is that the large store would **lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.**

The passage focuses on how highlighting a large competitor benefits the *smaller* competitor. This happens because consumers are more likely to support the ""underdog"" when they are aware of the competition from a much larger company. 
Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were told to focus on the store's *small* competitors, it would likely make the large store seem less appealing by comparison.  The most likely result is:
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.**

The research described in the passage shows that consumers often rally behind the ""underdog"" – the smaller brand facing competition from a larger one.  Highlighting a large competitor actually *helps* the small competitor by making consumers more aware of the David vs. Goliath dynamic.
Therefore, if a large chain bookstore emphasized its small competitors, it would likely have the *opposite* effect, making the large store seem less appealing by comparison.
The most logical outcome is:
* **D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.**

The passage demonstrates that consumers tend to favor smaller businesses when they are aware of the competition they face from larger corporations. This ""underdog effect"" means that highlighting a large competitor actually *benefits* the smaller competitor. 
If a large bookstore emphasized its competition with *smaller* bookstores, it would likely backfire. Consumers would be more likely to see the large bookstore as a threat to the smaller ones and choose to support the smaller businesses instead.

This passage highlights a consumer behavior pattern where awareness of a large competitor actually benefits the *smaller* competitor. Consumers, it seems, like to root for the underdog.

The central finding of the research presented is that consumers often root for the underdog. Highlighting a large competitor actually benefits the *smaller* competitor by triggering this instinct in consumers. 
Therefore, if a large chain bookstore focused on its competition with *smaller* bookstores, it would likely be counterproductive.  Customers might see the large store as a threat to the smaller businesses and choose to support the underdogs instead.

The passage details how Lady Carlotta misses her train and is then mistaken for a governess by a Mrs. Quabarl. Lady Carlotta does not correct the mistake but instead goes along with it.

The passage describes Lady Carlotta missing her train due to helping an overworked horse. She is then mistaken as a governess by Mrs. Quabarl and decides to go along with the charade. 
Let's analyze the answer choices:
* **A: A woman weighs the positive and negative aspects of accepting a new job.**  This doesn't fit because Lady Carlotta doesn't explicitly consider taking the job, she falls into the situation.
* **B: A woman does not correct a stranger who mistakes her for someone else.** This accurately reflects the core event of the passage – Lady Carlotta's acceptance of the mistaken identity. 
* **C: A woman impersonates someone else to seek revenge on an acquaintance.** There's no indication of revenge being a motive. The impersonation is accidental.
* **D: A woman takes an immediate dislike to her new employer.** While Lady Carlotta might not be fond of Mrs. Quabarl, the passage focuses more on the mistaken identity than on dislike.

  To simplify the expression, we need to find a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator.
  The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$.

Recurrent second-trimester abortions suggest a possible issue with the uterus's ability to support a pregnancy to term.  Of the options provided, the most logical next investigation is:
* **B: hysteroscopy**. This procedure allows a doctor to directly visualize the inside of the uterine cavity and the cervix. It can reveal abnormalities such as: 
    * Uterine septum: A wall of tissue that divides the uterus.
    * Fibroids: Noncancerous growths in the uterine wall.
    * Polyps: Growths attached to the inner wall of the uterus.
    * Cervical insufficiency: A weakened cervix that might open too early during pregnancy.

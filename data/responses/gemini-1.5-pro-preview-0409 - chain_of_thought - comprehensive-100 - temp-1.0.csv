  Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Area of the four walls = 2(length + breadth) * height = 2 * 5x * 2x = 20x<sup>2</sup>
  Area of the paper used on the walls = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15) sq.m
  Length of the paper used = (20x<sup>2</sup> - 15) / 0.5 = (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30) m
  Cost of the paper used = Rs.2 * (40x<sup>2</sup> - 30) = Rs. (80x<sup>2</sup> - 60)
  According to the problem, 80x<sup>2</sup> - 60 = 260

  We can set up a proportion to solve this problem.
  Let 'x' represent the total deer population. 
  20 (tagged deer in the second sample) is to 500 (total deer in the second sample) as 300 (total tagged deer) is to x (total deer population).
  This can be written as the proportion: 20/500 = 300/x
  Cross-multiplying, we get: 20x = 150000

 Because this information is contradictory, we cannot determine what percentage of employees take a summer but not a winter vacation.

  Let's represent the percentages as decimals:
  - Winter vacation: 0.75
  - Winter and summer vacation: 0.40
  - No vacation: 0.20
  This is a trick question! It seems like a standard overlapping sets problem, but there's faulty information. You can't have more employees taking both winter and summer vacations (40%) than employees taking winter vacations in total (75%). 
  Because of this, we cannot logically determine what percentage of employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

This question presents contradictory information. It states that 75% of employees take a winter vacation and that 40% take both winter and summer vacations. It is illogical for the subset (those taking both vacations) to be larger than the entire set (those taking winter vacations). 
Since the provided information is flawed, it's impossible to determine the actual percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. 
While we can't solve for the correct answer, it's likely that the question intended to imply that 40% of the 75% who take winter vacations ALSO take summer vacations.  However, without that clarification, we can't assume this to be true.

  We need to minimize the number of copper coins. That means we should maximize the number of brass coins.
  Each brass coin is worth 25 cents, so let's see what's the maximum multiple of 25 cents we can get closest to $3.40 (which is 340 cents).
  340 cents divided by 25 cents per brass coin = 13.6. 
  This means she could have retrieved a maximum of 13 brass coins.
  13 brass coins * 25 cents/brass coin = 325 cents.
  That leaves 340 cents - 325 cents = 15 cents from copper coins.
  To earn 15 cents from copper coins, she needs 15 cents / 20 cents/copper coin = 0.75, which rounds up to 1 copper coin because we can't have fractions of coins.

The researchers are proposing that a large meteorite impact occurred in Quebec about 215 million years ago, supported by the presence of meteorites and unusually high iridium and platinum levels. 
The key to supporting their findings is to strengthen the link between the elements (iridium and platinum) and the impact event.
Option **C** does this directly. It states that iridium and platinum are rare on Earth but common in meteorites. Finding them in high concentrations at this location and time period makes a meteorite impact the most plausible explanation.
Here's why the other choices are weaker:
* **A:** The rock's formation process doesn't explain the unusual presence of specific elements. 
* **B:** Mass extinctions, while sometimes linked to impacts, don't automatically confirm an impact happened in Quebec.
* **D:** The frequency of meteorite impacts in history doesn't directly support the evidence for this specific event.
**Therefore, option C best supports the research findings.**

The core of the researchers' argument is that the combination of meteorites, iridium, and platinum points to a large meteorite impact in Quebec approximately 215 million years ago.  
To support their findings, we need to strengthen the connection between the unusual presence of iridium and platinum and the impact event. 
Option **C** provides that crucial link. It states that these elements are rare on Earth but common in meteorites. Their high concentration at this site and time period strongly suggests a meteorite origin.
Let's look at why the other options are less compelling:
* **A:** The rock's formation doesn't directly explain the unusual levels of specific elements.
* **B:** While mass extinctions can be caused by impacts, this information alone doesn't confirm an impact in this location.
* **D:** Knowing that meteorite impacts have occurred throughout history doesn't specifically support this finding.
**Therefore, the most supportive answer is C.**

The researchers believe they've found evidence of a major meteorite impact in Quebec. Their evidence: meteorites and high levels of iridium and platinum in a geological layer dating back 215 million years. 
To bolster their case, we need to solidify the link between the uncommon elements and a meteorite impact.
Option **C** does exactly this. If iridium and platinum are rare on Earth but common in meteorites, their presence in unusually high concentrations at this site strongly suggests a meteorite impact occurred there.
Let's examine why the other choices are less supportive:
* **A**: The rock's formation doesn't explain the high concentration of specific elements.
* **B**:  While mass extinctions can be caused by impacts, this alone doesn't confirm one happened in Quebec specifically.

The argument links the arrival of humans in North America with the extinction of large mammals, implying a causal relationship.  **Option D directly challenges this causal relationship.**  It points out that the evidence (climate warming and extinctions coinciding with human arrival) could also support a scenario where climate change caused both the extinctions *and* prompted humans to migrate. 
Let's look at why the other choices are less damaging to the argument:
* **A:**  Whether or not the argument philosophically separates humans from nature doesn't address the core issue of correlation vs. causation.

* **Condition 3: O is performed either first or fifth.** This eliminates option E since it doesn't place O in either of those positions.
We are now left with options C and D:
* **Option C: O, P, R:** This sequence works if O is first.  A potential order would be: O, P, R, S, T, F, L, H. This sequence satisfies all the conditions.
* **Option D: O, P, T:** This option is impossible.  **Condition 1: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R** cannot be met with this arrangement. T is blocked from being next to F or R.
**Therefore, the only possible accurate order is C: O, P, R.**

Since S is fixed as the fourth composition, let's analyze the options based on how they fit with the given conditions:
* **Condition 5: P is performed at some time before S.** This immediately rules out options A and B, as P cannot be after S.
* **Condition 3: O is performed either first or fifth.** This rules out option E, as it doesn't place O in either position.
We are left with options C and D:
* **Option C: O, P, R:** This sequence works perfectly if O is first. A full possible order would be O, P, R, S, T, F, L, H.  This arrangement satisfies all other conditions.
* **Option D: O, P, T:**  This sequence makes **Condition 1: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R** impossible to satisfy. T is blocked in, preventing it from being next to either F or R.
**Therefore, only option C allows for a valid arrangement that adheres to all conditions.**

We need to determine which sequence of the first three compositions is possible if S is the fourth, considering all the rules:
* **S is fourth:** This is our anchor.
Let's analyze each choice:
* **A: F, H, P:** Violates **Condition 5: P is performed at some time before S.**
* **B: H, P, L:** Also violates **Condition 5.**
* **E: P, R, T:**  Violates **Condition 3: O is performed either first or fifth.**
This leaves us with options C and D:
* **Option C: O, P, R:** This works if O is first. The order could be O, P, R, S, T, F, L, H. This satisfies all the given conditions.
* **Option D: O, P, T:** This option fails because of **Condition 1: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.** Placing T third makes it impossible to be next to either F or R.

* **B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:** 
    * Satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
    * Doesn't violate the constraint regarding Lai and Mays as neither is assigned.
    * Triggers the constraint that if Gonzalez is at Silva, Lai must be at Thorne. However, this is not a violation, just a requirement if we choose this option.
    * Doesn't violate the constraint about Knutson, Heideck, and Mays.

Therefore, only options B and C don't violate any constraints and could be a complete assignment for the Silva University ceremony. However, the question asks for only one possible assignment. 
Looking closer, if we choose option C, it would require Lai at Thorne (due to Gonzalez being at Silva), leaving no space for both Heideck and Mays at Thorne, violating the last constraint.
Therefore, the most likely complete assignment for Silva University is option B.

* **B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:** This option satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck are assigned together. It also doesn't violate any other constraints because:
    * It doesn't require Lai and Mays to be assigned to any particular ceremonies.
    * It allows for the possibility of Lai being assigned to Thorne if needed.
    * It allows for flexibility in assigning Knutson, Heideck, and Mays.
* **C: Gonzalez, Knutson:**  This option triggers the constraint that Lai must be at Thorne because Gonzalez is at Silva. This might create a conflict later depending on the other constraints. 
* **D: Heideck, Lai:** This option violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
* **E: Knutson, Mays:** This option violates the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be.
Option B is the only one that doesn't immediately violate any constraints, and it also provides the most flexibility for assigning the remaining photographers without creating conflicts.

Let's break down the constraints and see which choices fit:
* **Constraint 1: Frost and Heideck are a package deal.**  They must go to the same ceremony. This eliminates choices D and E.
* **Constraint 2: Minimum two photographers per ceremony.** This eliminates no choices yet.
* **Constraint 3: No double-booking.** This eliminates choice A, as it uses all the photographers on one ceremony.
* **Constraint 4: Gonzalez at Silva forces Lai to Thorne.** This is important, but doesn't eliminate choices B or C yet.
* **Constraint 5: Knutson's absence from Thorne forces Heideck and Mays there.**
Now let's analyze the remaining choices:
* **B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck:**  
    * Satisfies Constraint 1 (Frost/Heideck together)
    * Satisfies Constraint 2 (more than 2 photographers)
    * Triggers Constraint 4 (Gonzalez at Silva means Lai is needed at Thorne, but we have room)
    * Doesn't violate Constraint 5 (Knutson's location is flexible) 
* **C: Gonzalez, Knutson:**
    * Satisfies Constraints 1 and 2 by omission (no pairings affected)
    * Triggers Constraint 4 (Gonzalez at Silva means Lai is needed at Thorne)
    * This LEADS TO violating Constraint 5:  If Lai is now at Thorne, and we can't have Knutson there (choice C), then BOTH Heideck and Mays are FORCED to Thorne. This leaves no one for Silva, violating the minimum photographers rule.
**Therefore, choice C is impossible due to the chain reaction it causes.**

* **Saxophonist:**  The saxophonist must be after EITHER the percussionist or trumpeter. If they were third, one of those two would have to be second. This is possible and doesn't violate any rules.
* **Trumpeter:** The trumpeter has no restrictions, so they could be third.
* **Violinist:** The violinist must be before the keyboard player. If they were third, the keyboard player would have to be fourth or later. This doesn't leave space for the guitarist before the fourth slot, violating the rule.

    3. K is on a higher shelf than F, meaning K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is there. So, option C is incorrect. 
    4. O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is there. This eliminates option D.

The argument concludes that Harrold Foods already dominates the market because 72% of consumers believe they do. This shows a confusion between belief and reality. 
Let's look at the answer choices:
* **A: failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition** - This doesn't quite fit. The argument isn't confused about cause and effect.
* **B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result** -  This is close. Dominating the market (the result) requires having over 50% market share. But the argument mistakenly assumes that consumer belief (the condition) guarantees this.
* **C: treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true** - The argument doesn't discuss anyone failing to prove Harrold Foods *doesn't* dominate.
* **D: taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true** - This is a perfect match! The survey only shows belief, not actual market share.

The argument states that people's positive opinion of Lopez's debate performance may be influenced by knowing he won the election. To undermine this, we need evidence that people favored Lopez *before* knowing the election results.
Let's look at the options:
* **A: Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate.**  This is irrelevant to the argument, as it doesn't address the opinions of those who *did* watch the debate.
* **B: Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez.** This directly contradicts the given information that viewers found Lopez to have made better arguments.
* **C: The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate.**  This implies that watching the debate made people *less* likely to vote for Lopez, weakening the idea that his debate performance contributed to his victory. However, it doesn't directly address pre-election sentiment.
* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.** This is the strongest option. If viewers were already inclined to vote for Tanner *before* the debate, then their positive feedback on Lopez's performance is unlikely to be solely due to knowing he won the election.

* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.**  This is the most compelling option. If viewers were already leaning towards Tanner before the debate, their positive assessment of Lopez's performance is unlikely to be solely due to his eventual win. It suggests a genuine shift in opinion.

* **D: Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.** This is the strongest counter-argument.  If viewers were already leaning towards Tanner *before* the debate, it means their positive assessment of Lopez's performance wasn't just a result of knowing he won after the fact.

* **E:**  This argues against overly severe penalties that make it practically impossible to establish guilt with sufficient certainty. While this touches on the importance of certainty, it doesn't directly connect the severity of the penalty to the *degree* of certainty required, which is the core message conveyed in option A.
**A** is the most direct and relevant choice. It succinctly expresses the principle that underpins the argument's reasoning: as the potential penalty increases in severity, so too must the level of certainty required to justify its imposition.

It highlights that simply believing one is receiving treatment can trigger a physiological response, leading to actual improvement even without a medically active component. Since only the group with magnets was aware of receiving treatment, their higher reported pain reduction could be attributed to the placebo effect rather than the magnets themselves. This directly undermines the causal relationship the physician is suggesting.
Let's look at why the other choices are weaker counterarguments:
* **B: Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do.** This compares the effectiveness of magnets to another treatment without addressing the validity of the experiment itself. It doesn't disprove that magnets offer *some* level of pain relief.
* **C: No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back.**  This focuses on the lack of external validation for the findings but doesn't inherently disprove the results of this particular experiment. 
* **D: Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment.** While this suggests potential bias in the experimental design, it doesn't automatically negate the results. The experiment might still have been conducted fairly, yielding accurate data despite pre-existing beliefs.
* **E: There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment.** This addresses the generalizability of the findings but doesn't invalidate them. Even with varied causes, the experiment still shows a correlation between magnet use and pain reduction within those specific participants.

The passage explains that primary substances are essential for a plant's core functions (growth, metabolism). In contrast, secondary substances aren't essential for those functions but offer benefits like attracting pollinators or deterring predators.  We need to choose the analogy that most closely mirrors this essential/non-essential but beneficial relationship.
Here's a breakdown of the choices:
* **A:** This compares essential power with backup power. While both relate to a hospital's function, it doesn't accurately reflect the plant analogy.
* **B:**  **This is the best analogy.**  The car's essential mechanical components (engine, transmission) are like primary substances, vital for basic operation. The non-essential features like paint (prevents rust) and taillights (safety signals) are comparable to secondary substances, providing additional advantages. 
* **C:**  This option describes two essential, interdependent parts (mechanical and electrical) within a factory system. It doesn't demonstrate the essential vs. non-essential and beneficial relationship we're looking for.
* **D:**  Similar to C, this illustrates two essential components of a train's braking system. 
* **E:**  This analogy focuses on different ways to store the same essential software, not the key difference between essential and non-essential elements.

The passage follows this progression:
1. **Starts** with the narrator expressing a general, deep-seated love for reading. This is more than just liking stories, it's his escape and solace.
2. **We see obstacles:** His father's dislike, the need to hide his reading, showing the depth of this passion.
3. **The shift:** It's NOT just hardship, but how this love leads to the bookseller and the GIFT of ""Great Expectations"". *This* becomes the turning point, not hardship alone.
Let's analyze the choices:
* **A: general discussion of the narrator's love of reading to a portrayal of an influential incident.** This is the most accurate. It's not just *any* incident, but one directly stemming from his reading love, making it influential.
* B: The father is part of the context, but the focus isn't on *him*, nor is there deep examination of Dickens beyond the narrator's admiration.
* C: While reading is a skill, the passage doesn't showcase how he *applies* it elsewhere, the focus is the internal impact.

Now the equation is:
$$\frac{x}{x-3} = x$$
Next, we need to be careful about dividing by zero.  The denominator, $x-3$, cannot be zero. Therefore, $x\neq3$. 
Now, we can consider two cases:
* **Case 1: x = 0**
   If we substitute *x = 0* into the original equation, we get:
   $$\frac{0}{0-3} = \frac{2 \cdot 0}{2}$$
   This simplifies to 0 = 0, which is true. So, *x = 0* is a solution.
* **Case 2: x ≠ 0**
   Since *x ≠ 0*, we can multiply both sides of the equation by *(x - 3)*:
   $$x = x(x - 3)$$
   Expanding the right side gives:
   $$x = x^2 - 3x$$
   Move all terms to one side:

   Factor out an *x*:

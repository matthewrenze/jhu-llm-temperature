  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  We know that the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  We also know that 40 employees take both vacations, so we need to subtract them from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation to get the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  Therefore, Q = 80 - 40 = 40.
  So, 40% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
- Let's assume that x helpers are required to make the cakes.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total number of hours available is 3x.
- The number of large cakes required is 20, and the number of small cakes required is 700.
- The number of large cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 2x * 3x = 6x^2.
- The number of small cakes that can be made by x helpers in 3x hours is 35x * 3x = 105x^2.
- We need to solve for x in the following equation: 6x^2 >= 20 and 105x^2 >= 700.
- The first inequality gives us x >= sqrt(20/6) = 1.825.
- The second inequality gives us x >= sqrt(700/105) = 2.645.

  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.

  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  The distance is the length of the tunnel, which is 1 mile.

  The ratio of the height of the pole to its shadow is 14/10.
  Let x be the height of the tree.
  The ratio of the height of the tree to its shadow is x/15.
  Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
  Therefore, we can set up the proportion: 14/10 = x/15 and solve for x.
  Cross-multiplying, we get 10x = 14 * 15.

  Therefore, we can set up the proportion: 14/10 = x/15 and solve for x.
  Cross-multiplying, we get 10x = 14 * 15.
  Solving for x, we get x = 21.

2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake, so the number of non-defective staplers rejected is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so 0.018x = 72.
Solving for x, we get x = 4000.

  If A and B are independent events, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs.
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)
  We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
  We can use these values to find P(neither A nor B) and then use that to find P(B).
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, which means the fencing is required for the remaining three sides.
  The perimeter of the yard is given as 2L + W = P.
  We need to find the value of P.
  We can solve for L and W using the area equation.
  L * W = 240, so W = 240/L.
  Substituting the value of W in the perimeter equation, we get P = 2L + 240/L.
  We can differentiate the perimeter equation with respect to L and find the value of L that minimizes the perimeter.
  Differentiating P with respect to L, we get dP/dL = 2 - 240/L^2.
  Setting dP/dL = 0, we get L = sqrt(240).
  Substituting the value of L in the perimeter equation, we get P = 2*sqrt(240) + 20.
  Therefore, Alice needs 2*sqrt(240) + 20 meters of fencing.

- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day must have been equal to the number of white golf balls sold during the day, which is 0.5 * 0.8 * 600 = 240.
- We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, so the number of yellow golf balls sold during the day is also 240.
- Therefore, the store had y + 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day, which is equal to 0.2 * 600 (the number of yellow golf balls remaining after the store sold 80% of its inventory).
- Solving for y, we get y = 120.
- Therefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

  The dog ate once an hour for 4 hours, starting at 8:00 am and ending at noon.
  At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl.
  Let F be the original amount of food in the bowl.
  After the first hour, the dog ate 1/3 of F, leaving 2/3 of F.
  After the second hour, the dog ate 1/3 of 2/3 of F, leaving 4/9 of F.
  After the third hour, the dog ate 1/3 of 4/9 of F, leaving 8/27 of F.
  After the fourth hour, the dog ate 1/3 of 8/27 of F, leaving 16/81 of F.
  Therefore, approximately 16/81 of the original food was in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon.
  To convert this fraction to a percentage, we can multiply by 100.
  16/81 * 100 = 19.75, which is approximately 20%.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 20%.

  Let's assume the length of the rectangular sheet is L and the breadth is B.
  When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm.
  When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the breadth of each part is 33cm.
  The area of the rectangular sheet is L*B.
  We know that L = 24 + 24 = 48 and B = 33 + 33 = 66.
  Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is 48*66 = 3168 sq.cm.
  The answer is not in the choices. Let's check the answer options using the closest value to 3168.

  If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price is 0.93M.
  The difference in profit is Rs. 15.
  We can set up an equation to solve for M.
  Profit with 5% discount - Profit with 7% discount = Rs. 15
  (0.95M - M) - (0.93M - M) = 15
  0.02M = 15
  M = 750
  Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

  A starts from a point and travels south 3km, which means A is 3km away from the starting point.
  Then A travels 5km towards east, which means A is 5km away from the starting point in the east direction.
  After that, A travels 3km towards north, which means A is 3km away from the starting point in the north direction.
  Finally, A travels 2km towards west, which means A is 2km away from the starting point in the west direction.
  We can draw a diagram to visualize the path of A.

    (2km W)--A--(5km E)
             |
          (3km S)
          
  We can see that A has formed a right-angled triangle with sides of length 3km, 5km, and 2km.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse, which is the distance of A from home.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.
  Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse is sqrt(3^2 + 5^2) = sqrt(34) km.
  The answer is not given in the choices, but the closest answer is E: 6km.

  We know that M > N, so a > c.
  We also know that M - N + 396c = 990.
  We can write M - N = 100a + 10b + c - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c).
  Therefore, 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 11(a + 3c) = 30.
  Since a and c are integers, the only possible values for (a + 3c) are 1, 2, and 3.
  If (a + 3c) = 1, then a = -8, which is not possible.
  If (a + 3c) = 2, then a = -7, which is not possible.
  If (a + 3c) = 3, then a = -6, which is not possible.
  Therefore, there are no values of M that satisfy the given conditions and are greater than 300.

  The ratio of their investments is (A:B:C) = (40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x))
  The ratio of their profits is the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is P.
  Then, P/C's investment = Total profit/Total investment
  P/(120000*(12-x)) = 375000/(40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12-x))
  Solving for x, we get x=4.
  Therefore, C joined the business after 4 months.

  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers are x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k-1.
  We know that the sum of these integers is 51.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
  x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
  Simplifying the left-hand side of the equation, we get:
  kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51
  kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51
  kx + (k^2-k)/2 = 51
  k(2x+k-1) = 102
  We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50.
  Substituting x = -50 in the above equation, we get:

  k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0
  Solving this quadratic equation, we get:

  We can eliminate k = 3 because the sum of 3 consecutive integers starting from -50 is -50 + (-49) + (-48) = -147, which is not equal to 51.
  Therefore, the answer is k = 96.

  Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
  After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4) * x = x^2 - 4x.
  When the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, two triangles are formed.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
  Let's assume that the base of each triangle is b feet and the height of each triangle is h feet.
  Then, (1/2) * b * h = 70.
  Therefore, b * h = 140.
  The base and height of each triangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which has a length of sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2).
  Therefore, (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2.
  Substituting b * h = 140, we get (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Solving for b and h, we get b = 2h/x and h = 2b/x.
  Substituting these into b * h = 140, we get (2h/x) * (2b/x) = 140, which simplifies to h * b = (x^2)/10.
  Substituting h = 2b/x, we get b^2 = (x^2)/20.
  Substituting this into (b^2 + h^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16, we get (x^2)/10 + (4b^2)/(x^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Multiplying both sides by (x^2)/10, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 16x^2 - 280x + 640 = 0.
  Factoring out (x-10), we get (x-10)(x^3 - 8x^2 - 160x + 64) = 0.
  The only positive root of this equation is x = 16.

  The hypotenuse of each triangle is the diagonal of the rectangular piece, which has a length of sqrt((x-4)^2 + x^2).
  Therefore, (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2.
  Substituting b * h = 140, we get (b^2 + h^2) = (x-4)^2 + x^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Solving for b and h, we get b = 2h/x and h = 2b/x.
  Substituting these into b * h = 140, we get (2h/x) * (2b/x) = 140, which simplifies to h * b = (x^2)/10.
  Substituting h = 2b/x, we get b^2 = (x^2)/20.
  Substituting this into (b^2 + h^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16, we get (x^2)/10 + (4b^2)/(x^2) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16.
  Multiplying both sides by (x^2)/10, we get x^4 - 8x^3 + 16x^2 - 280x + 640 = 0.
  Factoring out (x-10), we get (x-10)(x^3 - 8x^2 - 160x + 64) = 0.
  The only positive root of this equation is x = 16.
  Therefore, the original square piece of cloth had a side length of 16 feet.
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 * 16 = 64 feet.

  Let's assume that hose B fills 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, both hoses together fill 1/x + 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  We know that both hoses together filled 6/x of the pool in 3 hours.
  Therefore, 1/x + 1/y = 6/(3x) = 2/x.
  Solving for y, we get y = 2x.
  We need to find how long it would take hose B to fill the entire pool, which is 1/x + 1/y = 1/8.
  Substituting y = 2x, we get 1/x + 1/2x = 1/8.
  Solving for x, we get x = 4.
  Therefore, hose B can fill the entire pool in 12 hours.

  Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can substitute that value in for x and solve for m.
  1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3
  Square both sides: m^2 - 88 = 9 - 6m + m^2
  Simplify: 6m = 97
  Solve for m: m = 97/6
  Therefore, the value of m is approximately 16.17, which is closest to D: -16.2.

  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500, and only 20 of them had tags from the previous year.
  Therefore, the number of deer tagged in 2002 is 20.
  The total number of tagged deer in the forest is 300 + 20 = 320.
  The percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is 20/500 = 4%.
  If this percentage is representative of the total deer population in the forest with tags, then the total deer population in the forest is 320/0.04 = 8000.

  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  We can start by trying the answer choices:
  - If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 80 = 260 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 260. By solving this equation, we get x = 3 and y = 8. This means that she brought 4 copper coins, which is not the minimum number.
  - If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 60 = 280 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 280. By solving this equation, we get x = 2 and y = 10. This means that she brought 3 copper coins, which is the minimum number.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 3.

  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem.
  Let's use the following variables:
    - V: number of files infected by a virus
    - W: number of files infected by a worm
    - B: number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
  From the problem, we know that:
    - V + W - B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
    - V = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the first equation to solve for B: B = V + W - 250
  We can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get: V + W - B = 125
  We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: W = 2.5B
  We can substitute the second and fourth equations into the first equation to get: 3.5B = 125
  Solving for B, we get: B = 35
  Substituting B into the second equation, we get: W = 87.5
  Substituting V and W into the first equation, we get: V = 127.5

    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
    - V = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the first equation to solve for B: B = V + W - 250
  We can substitute the third equation into the first equation to get: V + W - B = 125
  We can substitute the second equation into the third equation to get: W = 2.5B
  We can substitute the second and fourth equations into the first equation to get: 3.5B = 125
  Solving for B, we get: B = 35
  Substituting B into the second equation, we get: W = 87.5
  Substituting V and W into the first equation, we get: V = 127.5
  The number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is V - B = 127.5 - 35 = 92.5
  The answer is not one of the choices, but the closest one is E: 125.

  Total distance covered by Bob = 78t + 78t = 156t km
  Total distance covered by Allen = 54t + 54t = 108t km
  Bob covers 48 km more than Allen by the time they meet for the second time.
  Therefore, 156t - 108t = 48

  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^25.
  Taking the square of both sides, we get 2^n = 2^50.

  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies after n days is 2^(n/2).
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  Therefore, 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days if there was initially one lily.
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the number of lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.

  Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  L+B = 170 meters.
  The length of the plot covered by gardening will be L+2 and the breadth will be B+2.
  The area of the gardening plot will be (L+2)(B+2) square meters.
  The cost of gardening per square meter is 10.
  Therefore, the total cost of gardening will be 10(L+2)(B+2).
  We can't determine the exact values of L and B from the given information.
  However, we can use the fact that the area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  We know that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.
  We also know that 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  Therefore, L+B = 170 meters.
  We can use this information to find the value of LB.
  L+B = 170
  L = 170 - B
  Substituting L in terms of B in the equation LB = Area, we get:
  B(170 - B) = Area
  170B - B^2 = Area
  We still can't determine the exact value of Area, but we can simplify the expression for the cost of gardening:
  Cost = 10(L+2)(B+2)
       = 10[(170-B)+2][(B)+2]
       = 10(172B - B^2 + 4B + 8)
       = 10(-B^2 + 176B + 80)
       = -10(B^2 - 176B - 80)
  We can complete the square to find the minimum value of this expression, but we don't need to do that to answer the question.
  We can see that the cost will be a positive value, so we can eliminate choices D and E.
  We can also see that the cost will be greater than 3400, so we can eliminate choice A.
  We are left with choice B: 1700.

  Therefore, the total cost of gardening will be 10(L+2)(B+2).
  We can't determine the exact values of L and B from the given information.
  However, we can use the fact that the area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  We know that the perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 meters.
  We also know that 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  Therefore, L+B = 170 meters.
  We can use this information to find the value of LB.
  L+B = 170
  L = 170 - B
  Substituting L in terms of B in the equation LB = Area, we get:
  B(170 - B) = Area
  170B - B^2 = Area
  We still can't determine the exact value of Area, but we can simplify the expression for the cost of gardening:
  Cost = 10(L+2)(B+2)
       = 10[(170-B)+2][(B)+2]
       = 10(172B - B^2 + 4B + 8)
       = 10(-B^2 + 176B + 80)
       = -10(B^2 - 176B - 80)
  We can complete the square to find the minimum value of this expression, but we don't need to do that to answer the question.
  We can see that the cost will be a positive value, so we can eliminate choices D and E.
  We can also see that the cost will be greater than 3400, so we can eliminate choice A.

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the equations, we get:
  F - J - 3S = 0  (Equation 1)
  F - J - 2F + 2S = 0  (Equation 2)
  Rearranging Equation 1, we get:
  F = J + 3S
  Substituting F in Equation 2, we get:
  J + 3S - J - 2(3S) = 0
  J - 3S = 0
  J = 3S
  Substituting J in Equation 1, we get:

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the equations, we get:
  F - J - 3S = 0  (Equation 1)
  F - J - 2F + 2S = 0  (Equation 2)
  Rearranging Equation 1, we get:
  F = J + 3S
  Substituting F in Equation 2, we get:
  J + 3S - J - 2(3S) = 0
  J - 3S = 0
  J = 3S
  Substituting J in Equation 1, we get:
  F = 10S
  Substituting F in the first equation, we get:
  3S + S + 10S = 100
  14S = 100
  S = 7.14 (approx)
  F = 10S = 71.4 (approx)
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is approximately 71.4.

  And, ""abcde1"" is 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e = 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 69999a = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  Since a is a digit, the right-hand side of the equation must be divisible by 69999.
  The only digit that makes the right-hand side divisible by 69999 is 3.
  Therefore, a = 3.
  Substituting a = 3 in the equation, we get 209997 = 27000 - 2997b - 297c - 27d - 2e.
  The largest value for b that satisfies the equation is 9.
  Substituting b = 9 in the equation, we get 179970 = 297c + 27d + 2e.
  The largest value for c that satisfies the equation is 6.
  Substituting c = 6 in the equation, we get 178272 = 27d + 2e.

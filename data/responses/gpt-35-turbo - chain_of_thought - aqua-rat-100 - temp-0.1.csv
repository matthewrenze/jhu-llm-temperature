  The formula for combination is nCr = n! / (r! * (n-r)!), where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose.
  In this case, n = 20 and r = 10.
  n! = 20! = 2432902008176640000
  r! = 10! = 3628800
  (n-r)! = 10! = 3628800
  nCr = 2432902008176640000 / (3628800 * 3628800) = 184756

  We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.
  We can use this information to find P(B).
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

  P(A) = 0.6
  P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A or B) = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.96 = -0.36 + P(B)
  We know that P(A and B) <= min(P(A), P(B)) = min(0.6, P(B)).

  If A and B are independent, then P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
  The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs.
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
  P(neither A nor B) = 1 - P(A or B)
  We can use these equations to solve for P(B).
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.96
  P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.6

  We know that E = (S - H - L)/(z - 2).
  We can substitute S = yz and H+L = 2x in the above equation to get:
  E = (yz - 2x)/(z - 2).
  We need to find the average score for the class excluding the highest and lowest scorers.
  Therefore, the answer is E/(z - 2).
  We can simplify the expression for E to get:
  E = (zy - 2x)/(z - 2).
  Therefore, the answer is D: (zy – 2x)/(z -2).

  Let's assume the length of the rectangular yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the rectangular yard is L * W = 240.
  One side of the yard is 10 meters, so the perimeter of the yard is L + W + L + 10 = 2L + W + 10.
  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, which means the length of fencing required is 2L + W + 10 - W = 2L + 10.
  We need to find the value of 2L + 10.
  We know that L * W = 240, so L = 240 / W.
  Substituting the value of L in the equation 2L + 10, we get 2(240/W) + 10 = (480 + 10W) / W.
  To minimize the value of fencing, we need to minimize the value of W.
  We can find the minimum value of W by finding the derivative of (480 + 10W) / W with respect to W and setting it to zero.

  Let's assume that the length of the yard is x meters and the width is y meters.
  The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters.
  Therefore, xy = 240.
  We know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, which means she needs to fence the perimeter of the yard except for the side that is already fenced.
  The perimeter of the yard is 2x + 2y meters.
  Alice does not need to fence the side of 10 meters.
  Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is 2x + 2y - 10 meters.
  We can solve for x and y using the equation xy = 240.
  We can then substitute the values of x and y in the equation for the perimeter to get the total length of fencing needed.
  After solving, we get the value of 58 meters.

  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, which means that the total length of the fencing required is L + W + L = 2L + W.
  We can solve for W in terms of L from the area equation: W = 240 / L.
  Substituting this value of W in the expression for the total length of fencing, we get: 2L + (240 / L).
  To minimize the length of fencing, we need to find the value of L that minimizes this expression.
  Taking the derivative of the expression with respect to L and setting it to zero, we get: 2 - (240 / L^2) = 0.
  Solving for L, we get: L = sqrt(120).
  Substituting this value of L in the expression for the total length of fencing, we get: 2L + (240 / L) = 2sqrt(120) + 20sqrt(3).

  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, which means that the fencing is required for the remaining three sides.
  The perimeter of the yard is given as 2L + W = P (since one side is unfenced).
  We need to find the value of P.
  We can solve the above two equations to get the value of L and W.
  Once we have the values of L and W, we can calculate the perimeter of the yard.
  Therefore, let's solve the above equations to get the value of P.
  L * W = 240
  W = 240 / L
  2L + W = P
  2L + 240 / L = P
  We need to find the value of P.
  Let's try the answer choices to see which one satisfies the above equation.
  If we try option C: 2L + 240 / L = 66
  2L^2 + 240 = 66L
  2L^2 - 66L + 240 = 0
  L^2 - 33L + 120 = 0
  (L - 8)(L - 25) = 0
  L = 8 or L = 25
  W = 240 / L
  If L = 8, then W = 30
  If L = 25, then W = 9.6
  We can ignore the case where L = 25 since it doesn't make sense.
  Therefore, L = 8 and W = 30.
  P = 2L + W = 2(8) + 30 = 46
  Therefore, Alice needs 46 meters of fencing.

- Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day ""y"".
- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day must be equal to the number of white golf balls the store sold during the day.
- Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls the store sold during the day is equal to half of the total number of golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively.

  When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm.
  Therefore, the length of each part is 33cm (since there are two parts).
  Let's consider the first case where the length of each part is 24cm.
  In this case, the length of the folded part is b/2 and the breadth of the folded part is 24cm.
  Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is 2(b/2 + 24) = b + 48.
  We know that b + 48 = 66 (since this is the perimeter when folded along the other set of sides).
  Therefore, b = 18cm.
  Now, let's consider the second case where the length of each part is 33cm.
  In this case, the length of the folded part is l/2 and the breadth of the folded part is 33cm.
  Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is 2(l/2 + 33) = l + 66.
  We know that l + 66 = 48 (since this is the perimeter when folded along the other set of sides).

As a result, each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
Therefore, the equation can be formed as follows:

  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Since [x+y] ≤ [2x+2y], we have [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ [2x] + [2y].

  It is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y) because L(x,y) is always less than or equal to R(x,y).

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For any real number x, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  Therefore, [x] ≤ x < [x] + 1.
  Similarly, [y] ≤ y < [y] + 1.
  [x + y] ≤ x + y < [x + y] + 1.
  [2x] ≤ 2x < [2x] + 1.

  L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y) + 1 < L(x,y) + 3.

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x+y).
  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Since [x+y] ≤ [2x+2y], we have L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y).
  Therefore, it is impossible to have L(x,y) < R(x,y).
  If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Let's consider the case where x = 1.5 and y = 1.5.
  Then, [x] = 1, [y] = 1, [x+y] = 3, [2x] = 3, and [2y] = 3.

  Let's consider the options one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y) implies [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     Since [x] ≤ x and [y] ≤ y, we have [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ x + y + [x + y]
     Similarly, [2x] ≤ 2x and [2y] ≤ 2y, we have [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2x + 2y
     Adding the above two inequalities, we get [x] + [y] + [x + y] + [2x] + [2y] ≤ 3x + 3y
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
     Therefore, 2([x] + [y] + [x + y]) ≤ 3x + 3y
     Since LHS is an even integer, RHS must also be an even integer.
     But, 3x + 3y is an odd integer for any positive real numbers x and y.
     Therefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).
     Hence, option A is not possible.
  B: This option is the negation of option A. Since option A is not possible, option B must be possible.
  C: If L(x,y) < R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y]
     Since [x] ≤ x and [y] ≤ y, we have [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ x + y + [x + y]
     Similarly, [2x] ≤ 2x and [2y] ≤ 2y, we have [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2x + 2y
     Adding the above two inequalities, we get [x] + [y] + [x + y] + [2x] + [2y] ≤ 3x + 3y
     But, [x] + [y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y]

     Since LHS is an even integer, RHS must be an odd integer.

  The total value of 25 paise coins = 0.25 * 0.01 * x = 0.0025x
  The total value of 50 paise coins = 0.50 * 0.01 * x = 0.005x
  The total value of 1 rupee coins = 1 * x = 1x
  The total value of all coins = 0.0025x + 0.005x + 1x = 1.0075x
  The total value of all coins = Rs. 700
  Therefore, 1.0075x = 700
  Solving for x, we get x = 694.73
  Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, we need to round off x to the nearest integer.
  Therefore, there are 695 coins of each 25 paise, 50 paise and 1 rupee.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x.
  The area of the four walls is 2x(5y - 2x).
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is the difference between the area of the four walls and the area of the doors and windows.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.4.
  We can form two equations from the given information and solve for x.
  2x/5y = 2/5
  2x(5y - 2x) - 15 = (5y - 2x)(2x + 5y)

  Let's assume that the two numbers are x and y.
  According to the problem, we have two equations:
    x^2 - y^2 = 256000
    x + y = 1000
  We can use the second equation to solve for one of the variables, say x:
    x = 1000 - y
  Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

  m is 25% of x is equivalent to m = (25/100) * 4my/100 = my/10.
  To express m as a percentage of x in terms of y, we need to divide m by x and multiply by 100, and substitute x = 4my/100.
  m/x * 100 = (my/10) / (4my/100) * 100 = 25/4.

  Let's write M and N in expanded form:
    M = 100a + 10b + c

  M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c).

  This means that the maximum value of (5c) is 6, which implies that c = 1 or c = 2.
  If c = 1, then (4a-4b) = 15, which gives us the solutions (a,b) = (4,1), (5,2), (6,3), (7,4), (8,5), (9,6).
  If c = 2, then (4a-4b) = 25, which gives us the solutions (a,b) = (7,2), (8,3), (9,4).
  Out of these solutions, only (a,b,c) = (9,6,1) gives us M > 300.
  Therefore, there is only 1 value of M that is more than 300.

  To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  The cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour.
  The distance to be traveled is 48 miles.
  We can convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute by dividing by 60.
  So, the speed of the cyclist is 12/60 = 0.2 miles per minute.
  We can now use the formula to calculate the time it will take to travel 48 miles.
  time = distance / speed = 48 / 0.2 = 240 minutes.

  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes that are both higher and lower than $3000.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2-th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is equal to the sum of the incomes above $3000.
  Let's assume that there are k incomes that are below $3000.
  Then, there are (n-k) incomes that are above $3000.
  The sum of the incomes below $3000 is k*$3000.
  The sum of the incomes above $3000 is (n-k)*$3000.

  We know that the total income of the family is $9000, so:
    3000x + 3000y + 3000z = 9000
    x + y + z = n
  Substituting x = 2y and n = 3y, we get:

  C's share of the profit is 150,000, which is (150,000/375,000) = 2/5 of the total profit.
  Therefore, the ratio of C's investment to the total investment is 2/5.
  We can equate the two ratios to get: 1440-120x : 2520-120x = 2 : 5
  Solving for x, we get x = 4

  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers start from x.
  Then, the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as kx.
  We know that the least integer is -50, so the first integer in the sequence is -50.
  Therefore, we can write the sum of k consecutive integers as kx = -50 + (-50+1) + (-50+2) + ... + (-50+k-1)
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get kx = k(-50) + (1+2+...+k-1)
  We know that the sum of the first n natural numbers is n(n+1)/2, so 1+2+...+k-1 = k(k-1)/2

  Let's assume that the length of the painted sides is l and w, where l is the length and w is the width of the parking space.
  The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, which means w = 9.
  The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, which means l + 2w = 37.
  Substituting w = 9 into the equation, we get l + 18 = 37, which means l = 19.

  Let's assume that the painted sides are x, y, and z.
  We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet.
  Therefore, the length of the painted sides is x + y + z = 37 - 9 = 28 feet.
  We also know that the parking space is rectangular.
  Therefore, the opposite sides are equal in length.
  So, x = z.
  Therefore, 2x + y = 28.
  We can solve for y in terms of x: y = 28 - 2x.
  The area of the parking space is A = xy.
  Substituting y = 28 - 2x, we get A = x(28 - 2x) = 28x - 2x^2.
  To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of A with respect to x and set it equal to zero.
  dA/dx = 28 - 4x = 0.
  Solving for x, we get x = 7.

  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5.
  Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for the other root: x = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4(1)(22))) / 2(1)
  Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we can substitute that in for x and solve for m.
  1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Multiply both sides by 2: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3

  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5.
  Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for the other root: x = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4*1*22)) / 2*1
  We know that one of the roots is 1.5, so let's substitute that in for x: 1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4*1*22)) / 2*1
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Squaring both sides of the equation, we get: 9 = m^2 - 2*m*sqrt(m^2 - 88) + m^2 - 88
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 2*m^2 - 2*m*sqrt(m^2 - 88) - 79 = 0
  We can solve for m using the quadratic formula: m = [2*sqrt(m^2 - 88) ± sqrt(4*(m^2 - 88)*2*79)] / 4
  Simplifying this equation, we get: m = sqrt(m^2 - 88) ± sqrt(79*(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Since we know that one of the roots is 1.5, we know that the quadratic equation can be written as (x - 1.5)(x + a) = 0, where a is the other root.
  Expanding this equation, we get: x^2 + (a - 1.5)x - 1.5a = 0
  We also know that the quadratic equation can be written as x^2 + mx + 22 = 0.
  Equating the coefficients of the two equations, we get: a - 1.5 = -m and -1.5a = 22
  Solving for a, we get: a = -22/1.5 = -14.67
  Substituting this value of a into the equation a - 1.5 = -m, we get: -14.67 - 1.5 = -m

Let's first find the remainder when 2272 is divided by N.
Let's also find the remainder when 875 is divided by N.
Since both the remainders are the same, the difference between 2272 and 875 should also be divisible by N.
The difference between 2272 and 875 is 1397.
The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397.
Therefore, the 3-digit number N can be 1 or 1397.

  If two numbers leave the same remainder when divided by a third number, then their difference is divisible by that third number.
  Let's assume that the remainder is x when 2272 and 875 are divided by N.
  Then, we can write:
    2272 - x = aN
    875 - x = bN
  where a and b are integers.
  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
    1397 = (a - b)N
  Since 1397 is a prime number, it has only two factors: 1 and 1397.
  Therefore, either a - b = 1 and N = 1397 or a - b = 1397 and N = 1.
  The second case is not possible because N is a 3-digit number.
  So, we have a - b = 1 and N = 1397.
  We also know that N is a 3-digit number, so N = 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are digits.
  Therefore, 1397 = (100a + 10b + c) and x = 2272 - aN = 875 - bN.
  Solving for a, b, and c, we get a = 13, b = 12, and c = 5.
  The sum of the digits of N is a + b + c = 13 + 12 + 5 = 30.

  and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109  ---(2)
  If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 100a + 10b + c - 495.
  This is equal to 100c + 10b + a, since the digits are written in reverse order.
  Therefore, 99a - 99c = 495
  Simplifying, we get a - c = 5  ---(3)
  From (1) and (3), we get 2b = 12, which implies b = 6.
  Substituting b = 6 in (1), we get a + c = 11  ---(4)
  From (3) and (4), we get a = 8 and c = 3.

  Let the three-digit number be represented by ABC, where A, B, and C are the digits.
  From the problem, we know that A + B + C = 17 and A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109.
  We also know that 100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A.
  Simplifying the equation above, we get 99A - 99C = 495, which implies A - C = 5.
  We can use the first two equations to solve for B, which is equal to 3.
  Therefore, the number is 3AB, and A + B + 3 = 17, which implies A + B = 14.
  We can use trial and error to find that A = 9 and B = 5.
  Therefore, the number is 395, and 395 - 495 = -100, which is not the same as 593.
  We made a mistake, so we need to try again.
  Since A - C = 5, we can have A = 8 and C = 3 or A = 9 and C = 4.
  If A = 8 and C = 3, then B = 6, which is not possible since the sum of the digits is 17.
  Therefore, A = 9 and C = 4, which implies B = 4.
  Therefore, the number is 944, and 944 - 495 = 449, which is the same as 944 written in reverse order.

  Let the three-digit number be represented by ABC.
  The sum of the digits is 17, so A + B + C = 17.
  The sum of the squares of the digits is 109, so A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109.
  If we subtract 495 from the number, we get 100A + 10B + C - 495.
  This is equal to 100C + 10B + A, since the digits are written in reverse order.
  Simplifying, we get 99A - 99C = 495, or A - C = 5.
  We can use this equation to solve for A and C in terms of B.
  Since A + B + C = 17, we have B = (17 - A - C).
  Substituting into A - C = 5, we get A - (17 - A - C) = 5, or 2A - C = 22.
  We can also use the equation A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 to solve for A and C in terms of B.
  Since B = (17 - A - C), we have A^2 + (17 - A - C)^2 + C^2 = 109.
  Simplifying, we get 2A^2 + 2C^2 + 2AC - 34A - 34C + 210 = 0.
  Substituting 2A - C = 22, we get 5A^2 - 68A + 169 = 0.
  Solving for A, we get A = 13 or A = 4.
  If A = 13, then C = 11, which is not a digit.
  Therefore, A = 4 and C = -1, which is also not a digit.
  Thus, there is no three-digit number that satisfies the conditions.

  Let's use the following variables:
    - V: number of files infected by a virus
    - W: number of files infected by a worm
    - B: number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
  From the problem, we know that:
    - V + W - B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
    - V = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the second equation to solve for B: B = W/2.5
  We can substitute this into the first equation to get: V + W - (W/2.5) = 250
  Simplifying this equation, we get: V = 100
  We can now use this information to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm: 250 - W = 250 - (V + B) = 250 - (100 + (W/2.5)) = 150 - (W/2.5)
  We can solve for W: W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) => W - 2.5(W/2.5) = 100 => W = 140
  We can now substitute this into the equation we found earlier to get: 150 - (140/2.5) = 100

    - w = 2.5b = 2.5(250 - v - b) = 625 - 2.5v - 2.5b
    - b = 250 - v - w = 250 - v - 625 + 2.5v + 2.5b = 2.5v - 375 + 2.5b
    Simplifying these equations, we get:
    - 3.5b + 2.5v = 625
    - 2.5b - 2v = -125
  We want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, which is equal to v + b. We can solve for b in terms of v using the second equation above, and substitute into the first equation:
    - 2.5(2v + 125) - 2v = 5v + 312.5 - 2v = 3v + 312.5 = b
    - v + b = v + 3v + 312.5 = 4v + 312.5
  We can solve for v:
    - 2.5(2v + 125) - 2v = -125
    - 3v = -500
    - v = -166.67 (This is not possible since v represents a number of files. Therefore, we made a mistake in our calculations.)

  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem.
  Let's use the following variables:
    - V: number of files infected by a virus
    - W: number of files infected by a worm
    - B: number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
  From the problem, we know that:
    - V + W - B = 250 (all files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
    - W - 2.5B = 0.4(250) (the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm, and 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can solve for B in the second equation: B = W/2.5
  We can substitute this into the first equation: V + W - (W/2.5) = 250
  We can simplify this to: V + (7/5)W = 250
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V = 0.5(250) = 125
  We can substitute this into the equation above: 125 + (7/5)W = 250
  We can solve for W: W = 125(5/7) = 89.29 (rounded to two decimal places)
  We want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, which is: 250 - W = 160.71 (rounded to two decimal places)

  Let's assume that the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm is x.
  Then, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x.
  Let's represent the number of files not infected by a virus as y.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so y = 0.5(250) = 125.
  We need to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm.
  The total number of files infected by a virus is (250 - y).
  Using the Venn diagram, we can write the equation: 
  (250 - y) = x + 2.5x + y
  Solving for x, we get x = 50.
  Therefore, the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5x = 125.

  We can use the second equation to solve for B: B = W/2.5
  We can substitute this into the first equation to get: V + W - (W/2.5) = 250
  Simplifying this equation, we get: V + (7/5)W = 250
  We can substitute the third equation into this equation to get: (0.5)(250) + (7/5)W = 250
  Simplifying this equation, we get: W = 125
  Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is: 250 - (125 + 2.5B) = 125 - 2.5B
  We don't know the value of B, but we know that it is less than or equal to W (since all files infected by both a virus and a worm are also infected by a worm).
  The maximum value of B is when all files infected by both a virus and a worm are also infected by a worm, which means B = W = 125.
  In this case, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is: 125 - 2.5(125) = 125 - 312.5 = -187.5
  This doesn't make sense, so we need to consider the next highest value of B, which is when B = 0 (i.e. no files are infected by both a virus and a worm).
  In this case, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is: 125 - 2.5(0) = 125

- The cost of the newspapers on Sunday is $4 per newspaper, and the cost of the newspapers on the other days of the week is $1 per newspaper.
- The hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation: 4x + 1(2y * 7) = 210
- We can simplify this equation to: 4x + 14y = 210
- We need to find the number of newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, which is the same as the number of newspapers it buys on any other day of the week.
- We can use the equation 4x + 1(2y * 6) = 210 to solve for y, and then use that value to solve for the number of newspapers bought on Monday.
- Solving the first equation for y, we get: y = (210 - 4x) / 14
- Substituting this value of y into the second equation, we get: 4x + 1(2((210 - 4x) / 14) * 6) = 210
- Simplifying this equation, we get: 4x + 12(210 - 4x) / 14 = 210

- Combining like terms, we get: 8x = 420
- Solving for x, we get: x = 52.5
- Since the hotel can't order half a newspaper, we need to round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 53.
- Therefore, the hotel orders 53 newspapers on Sunday, and 2y = 2(210 - 4x) / 14 = 2(210 - 4(52.5)) / 14 = 36 newspapers on any other day of the week.

  Let's assume the distance travelled by the jeep is ""d"" km.
  Let's also assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is ""s"" km/hr.
  Then, the speed of the jeep in the return journey is ""s+12"" km/hr.
  We know that distance = speed x time.
  From the problem, we can write two equations:
    d = s x 6   (Equation 1)
    d = (s+12) x 4   (Equation 2)
  We can solve for ""s"" by equating Equation 1 and Equation 2:
    s x 6 = (s+12) x 4
    6s = 4s + 48
    2s = 48
    s = 24
  We can substitute ""s"" in Equation 1 to find ""d"":
    d = s x 6
    d = 24 x 6
    d = 144
  Therefore, the distance travelled by the jeep is 144 km.

  Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is x km/hr.
  Let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
  According to the problem, the distance covered in the forward journey is the same as the distance covered in the return journey.
  Therefore, Distance in the forward journey = Distance in the return journey
  Distance = Speed x Time
  Let's calculate the distance covered in the forward journey: Distance = x km/hr * 6 hrs = 6x km
  Let's calculate the distance covered in the return journey: Distance = (x+12) km/hr * 4 hrs = 4(x+12) km
  Since the distance covered in the forward journey is the same as the distance covered in the return journey, we can equate the two equations:
  6x = 4(x+12)
  Solving for x, we get x = 24 km/hr

  Distance covered in the return journey = (x+12) * 4
  The total distance covered by the jeep = Distance covered in the forward journey + Distance covered in the return journey

  Train M travels for x hours after 5 am before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for (x - 2) hours before it meets Train M.
  The distance traveled by Train M is the same as the distance traveled by Train N when they meet.
  The speed of Train M is constant, so the distance it travels is proportional to the time it travels.
  The same is true for Train N.
  Therefore, we can set up the following equation to solve for x:
  Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
  Speed of Train M * Time traveled by Train M = Speed of Train N * Time traveled by Train N

  Let's assume that the ratio of the speeds of the two trains is a:b.
  Then, S1/S2 = a/b.
  We can't find the exact ratio of the speeds of the two trains from the given information.
  However, we can eliminate some choices based on the given information.
  The time taken by the two trains to meet each other cannot be less than 1 hour.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be D or E.
  Let's calculate the value of x for the remaining choices.
  For choice A, x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2) = (4S1 + 6) / (2S1) = 2S1 + 3
  For choice B, x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2) = (4S1 + 6) / (3S1/2) = 8S1/3 + 4
  For choice C, x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2) = (4S1 + 6) / (4S1/3) = 3 + 9/2
  Choice B gives an integer value of x, which means the two trains meet at a specific time.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 1 hr 15 min.

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train N's departure.
  Distance covered by Train M in x hours = Distance covered by Train N in (x-2) hours.
  Distance covered by Train M in 4 hours = Distance covered by Train N in (4-2) = 2 hours.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Distance covered by Train M = S1 * 4
  Distance covered by Train N = S2 * (x-2)
  Distance covered by Train M = Distance covered by Train N
  S1 * 4 = S2 * (x-2)
  x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2)
  The time when the two trains meet is 7 am + x hours.
  Let's substitute the values of S1, S2, and x to find the answer.
  S1 = Distance / Time = Distance covered by Train M / Time taken by Train M = Distance covered by Train N / Time taken by Train N = S2 * 4 / 3.5
  S1 = (4/3.5) * S2
  x = (4S1 + 6) / (2S2) = (4/3.5) * S2 * 4 + 6 / (2S2) = 46/7
  The time when the two trains meet is 7 am + 46/7 hours.
  Convert 46/7 hours to hours and minutes.
  46/7 hours = 6 hours and 34/7 minutes = 6 hours and 4 minutes (approx).
  Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 7:04 am.

  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  Therefore, L+B = 170 meters.
  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  The area of the rectangular plot with the 1-meter broad boundary is (L+2)*(B+2).
  The area of the boundary is (L+2)*(B+2) - L*B.
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter is 10.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the boundary is (L+2)*(B+2) - L*B * 10.
  Substituting L+B = 170, we get (170-2B)*(B+2) - B*(170-2B) * 10.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 340B - 36B^2 = 680.
  Solving the above quadratic equation, we get B = 5 or B = 31.67.
  Since B cannot be 5 (as the length of the rectangular plot would be negative), B must be 31.67.
  Therefore, the length of the rectangular plot is L = 138.33.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*B = 4375.56.
  The area of the rectangular plot with the 1-meter broad boundary is (L+2)*(B+2) = 5202.22.

  Therefore, L+B = 170.
  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  The area of the rectangular plot with a 1-meter broad boundary is (L+2)*(B+2).
  The area of the boundary is (L+2)*(B+2) - L*B.
  The cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot at the rate of 10 per square meter is 10*(L+2)*(B+2 - L*B).
  We have two equations L+B = 170 and the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is 10*(L+2)*(B+2 - L*B).
  We can solve these equations to find the cost of gardening.
  Therefore, the answer is not ""Cannot be determined"" or ""None of these"".
  Let's calculate the cost of gardening using the given equations.
  L+B = 170 => B = 170 - L
  Cost of gardening = 10*(L+2)*(B+2 - L*B)
                    = 10*(L+2)*((170-L)+2 - L*(170-L))
                    = 10*(L+2)*(172 - L - L^2 + 170L)
                    = 10*(L+2)*(172 + 169L - L^2)
                    = 10*(L^3 - L^2 + 341L + 688)
  We can find the value of L by solving the cubic equation 10*(L^3 - L^2 + 341L + 688) = C, where C is the cost of gardening.
  However, we don't need to solve the cubic equation to find the answer.
  We can use the answer choices to estimate the value of C.
  Let's try answer choice A.
  C = 3400
  L^3 - L^2 + 341L + 688 = 340
  L^3 - L^2 + 341L - 2712 = 0
  We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find the roots of the cubic equation.
  The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2, ±4, ±8, ±19, ±38, ±76, ±2712.
  By trying these roots, we can find that L = 8 is a root of the cubic equation.
  Therefore, (L-8) is a factor of the cubic equation.
  We can use polynomial division to find the other factor and solve the quadratic equation.
  (L-8)*(L^2 + 7L - 339) = 0
  L = 8 or L = (-7 ± sqrt(7^2 + 4*339))/2
  L = 8 or L ≈ 19.5 or L ≈ -26.5 (not possible)
  The value of L should be positive and less than 170.
  Therefore, L = 8 is the only possible value of L.
  Let's calculate the cost of gardening using L = 8.
  C = 10*(L^3 - L^2 + 341L + 688)
    = 10*(512 - 64 + 2728 + 688)
    = 34400

  Therefore, F - y = 2(S - y).
  We have three equations and three unknowns, which we can solve to find the age of Joe's father.
  From J + S + F = 100, we know that J + S = 100 - F.
  From J = F, we know that S = 100 - 2F.
  Substituting S = 100 - 2F into F - y = 2(S - y), we get F - y = 200 - 2F - 2y.

  From the first statement, we know that J + S + F = 100.
  From the second statement, we know that when J = F, S + (F - S) * 2 = 2S.
  Simplifying the second statement, we get F - S = S.
  From the third statement, we know that when J = F, F = 2 * (S - F + J).
  Simplifying the third statement, we get 3F - 2J - 2S = 0.
  We can use these three equations to solve for F.
  Solving the first equation for S, we get S = 100 - J - F.
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get F - (100 - J - F) = (100 - J - F).
  Simplifying this, we get F = 75/2 - J/2.
  Substituting this into the third equation, we get 225/2 - 3J/2 - 2S = 0.
  Substituting S = 100 - J - F, we get 225/2 - 5J/2 + 3F = 0.

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume x is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father.
  So, J + x = F + x
  S + x = 2S
  Therefore, S = x
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume y is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father.
  So, F + y = 2(S + y)
  We can simplify this equation to F + y = 2S + 2y
  We know that S = x, so we can substitute S with x.
  Therefore, F + y = 2x + 2y
  We can simplify this equation to F = x + y
  We have two equations now: J + S + F = 100 and F = x + y
  We need to find F, so we need to eliminate J and S from the equations.
  We know that S = x, so we can substitute S with x in the first equation.
  Therefore, J + x + F = 100
  We also know that F = x + y, so we can substitute F with x + y in the first equation.
  Therefore, J + x + x + y = 100
  We can simplify this equation to J + 2x + y = 100
  We need to eliminate J from this equation, so we can use the equation J + x + F = 100.
  We know that J + x = F + x, so we can substitute J + x with F + x in the equation J + 2x + y = 100.
  Therefore, F + x + y = 100
  We know that F = x + y, so we can substitute F with x + y in the equation F + x + y = 100.
  Therefore, x + y + x + y = 100
  We can simplify this equation to 2x + 2y = 100
  We can simplify this equation further to x + y = 50
  We know that F = x + y, so we can substitute x + y with 50 in the equation F = x + y.
  Therefore, F = 50
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 50.

  This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can simplify this equation to get F - J = 2F - 2S, which is equivalent to F = 2S + J.
  We can substitute this expression for F into the first equation to get J + S + (2S + J) = 100.
  Simplifying this equation gives us 3J + 3S = 100, which is equivalent to J + S = 33.33.
  We can substitute this expression for J + S into the equation F = 2S + J to get F = 2(33.33 - S) + S.
  Simplifying this equation gives us F = 66.67 - S.
  We know that J + S + F = 100, so we can substitute F with 66.67 - S to get J + S + 66.67 - S = 100.
  Simplifying this equation gives us J + 66.67 = 100, which is equivalent to J = 33.33.
  We can substitute this expression for J into the equation J + S = 33.33 to get S = 33.33 - J.
  Simplifying this equation gives us S = 0.
  We can substitute this expression for S into the equation F = 66.67 - S to get F = 66.67.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 66.67.

  Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time he took to travel from B to A is d/90.
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he had already traveled a distance of d-70 miles from A to B, and he had traveled a distance of 70 miles from B back to the point where he was 70 miles away from B.
  The total distance he traveled is (d-70) + 70 = d miles.
  We also know that he had 3 hours left to complete his trip when he was 70 miles away from B.
  Using the formula: distance = rate x time, we can write an equation for the total distance he traveled:
  d = 70(d/70) + 90(d/90 - 3)
  Solving for d, we get d = 360.
  Therefore, the distance between A and B is 360 miles.

  Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"".
  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B ""t"".
  We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can use the formula distance = rate x time to get:
  d = 70t
  We also know that once Kevin reached B, he turned around and drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Let's call the time it takes him to travel from B to A ""t2"". We can use the same formula to get:
  d = 90t2
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already been driving for t + t2 - 3 hours. We can use this information to set up an equation:
  70 = 70(t + t2 - 3)
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  t + t2 = 4
  We can use the two equations we have for d to solve for t and t2:
  d = 70t
  d = 90t2
  Dividing the second equation by the first, we get:
  t2/t = 9/7
  Solving for t, we get:
  t = 7d/160

  Let's assume the 5 digit number is ""abcde"".
  According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes ""abcde1"" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is ""1abcde"".
  So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
  Multiplying 3 with the number ""1abcde"" gives us 300000 + 30000a + 3000b + 300c + 30d + 3e.
  And, the number ""abcde1"" can be written as 100000a + 10000b + 1000c + 100d + 10e + 1.

  Since a, b, c, d, and e are digits, a can only be 1 or 2.
  If a = 1, then 69997 = 970b + 70c + 7d + 699999, which is not possible as the sum on the right side is greater than 99999.
  Therefore, a must be 2.
  Substituting a = 2 in the equation, we get 139994 = 970b + 70c + 7d + 699999.
  Solving for d, we get d = 4.
  Substituting d = 4 in the equation, we get 139924 = 970b + 70c + 28 + 699999.
  Simplifying the equation, we get 970b + 70c = 599947.

  Let's assume the number of employees in the organization is ""x"".
  Each employee contributes the same amount, so the amount contributed by each employee is ""6 lakh / x"".
  If each employee had contributed Rs. 60 extra, the amount contributed by each employee would be ""(6.24 lakh) / x"".
  According to the problem, the difference between the two amounts is Rs. 60.
  Therefore, we can write the equation as follows:
  (6.24 lakh / x) - (6 lakh / x) = 60
  Solving this equation for ""x"" gives us the number of employees in the organization.
  Multiplying both sides by ""x"" gives us:
  6.24 lakh - 6 lakh = 60x
  24000 = 60x
  x = 400
  Therefore, there are 400 employees in the organization.

Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount.
So, each daughter receives 4x amount.
And, each son receives 5x amount.
Total number of recipients = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600
Let's calculate the amount received by all nephews together.
So, 2 nephews receive 2x amount.
Total amount received by all nephews = 2x
Total amount received by all sons = 5x * 5 = 25x
Total amount received by all daughters = 4x * 4 = 16x
Total amount received by all recipients = 2x + 25x + 16x = 43x
According to the question, the total amount received by all recipients is Rs 8600.

  For each additional quarter mile, the cab charges 10 cents, which is equivalent to $0.10/0.25 = $0.40 per mile.
  Therefore, the cost of the remaining distance is $0.40(x - 0.25).
  The total cost of the trip is $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25).
  We want to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50, which means we need to solve the following equation:
  $3.50 + $0.40(x - 0.25) = $8.50
  $0.40(x - 0.25) = $5.00
  x - 0.25 = 12.5
  x = 12.75
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's assume that the maximum distance we can travel is x miles.
  The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, which means we have $5.00 left to spend on the remaining distance.
  For each additional quarter mile, we spend 10 cents, which means we spend 40 cents for each mile.
  Therefore, we can write the equation: 0.40(x-0.25) = 5.00 - 3.50
  Solving for x, we get x = 12.75 miles.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

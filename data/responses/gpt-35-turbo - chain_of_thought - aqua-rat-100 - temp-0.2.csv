  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  The total number of employees who take a summer vacation is the number of employees who take both vacations plus the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  This can be expressed as (40 + Q).
  The total number of employees in the company who take at least one vacation is (75 + 40 - Q).
  The total number of employees in the company is 100.
  We can use these equations to solve for Q.
  (75 + 40 - Q) + 20 = 100

  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's assume that Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  The number of employees who take a summer vacation is (100 - 20)% = 80% of the total employees = 80 employees.
  The number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations is 40.
  The number of employees who take only a winter vacation is (75 - 40) = 35.
  The number of employees who take only a summer vacation is (80 - 40) = 40.
  The number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (40 - Q) employees.
  We can now set up an equation to solve for Q:
  (40 - Q) / 100 = (number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation) / 100
  (40 - Q) / 100 = (number of employees who take only a summer vacation) / 100

  We can use the formula: distance = speed x time.
  We know the speed of the train is 120 miles per hour.
  We need to convert the speed to miles per second.
  120 miles/hour = 120/3600 miles/second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour)
  120/3600 = 1/30 miles/second
  Let's call the length of the train ""x"".
  The train travels the length of the tunnel plus its own length in the time it takes to exit the tunnel.
  So, we can set up the equation: (1 + x) = (1/30)t, where t is the time it takes to exit the tunnel.
  We can solve for t: t = 30(1 + x)
  We know that the train's length is x, and we need to convert the length to miles.
  1 mile = 5280 feet
  We can assume that the length of the train is in feet.
  So, we can convert the length of the train to miles: x/5280 miles
  Now, we can substitute x/5280 for x in the equation: t = 30(1 + x/5280)
  We can simplify the equation: t = 30 + 30x/5280
  We need to solve for t when x is the length of the train.
  We can use the formula: speed = distance/time
  We know the speed is 120 miles per hour, and we need to convert it to miles per second.
  120 miles/hour = 120/3600 miles/second = 1/30 miles/second
  We know the distance is the length of the train, which is x.
  We can solve for time: time = distance/speed = x/(1/30) = 30x
  We can set the two equations equal to each other: 30x = 30 + 30x/5280
  We can solve for x: x = 88 feet

  We can rearrange the formula to get: time = distance / speed.
  We can substitute the values and solve for time.

Calculation:
  Speed of train = 120 miles/hour = 1/30 miles/second
  Distance = length of train + length of tunnel = x + 1 mile
  Time = distance / speed = (x + 1) / (1/30) seconds
  We know that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so the total time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 seconds plus the time it takes to travel the length of the tunnel.
  Total time = 3 + (x + 1) / (1/30) seconds
  We can simplify the expression by multiplying the denominator by the numerator in the second term.
  Total time = 3 + 30(x + 1) seconds
  We can distribute the 30.
  Total time = 3 + 30x + 30 seconds
  Total time = 30x + 33 seconds

  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile long tunnel.
  The train's length plus the tunnel's length is equal to 1 mile.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  We need to convert the speed to miles per second.
  120 miles per hour = 2 miles per minute = 1/30 miles per second.
  Let's call the length of the train ""x"".
  Then, we have the equation: x + 1 = 1 mile.
  Solving for ""x"", we get: x = 0.  (The length of the train is negligible compared to the length of the tunnel.)
  Therefore, the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is: time = distance / speed = 1 / (1/30) = 30 seconds.
  The answer is C: 20 seconds.

  To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color, we need to take out ties of different colors until we have two ties of the same color.
  The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color before we get two of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out 5 different ties before we can be sure that we have at least two ties of the same color.
  We can check that this is true by considering the case where we take out 4 ties: we could take out one of each color, leaving us with only one tie of each color.

  We need to find the minimum number of ties we need to take out to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color.
  The worst-case scenario is that we pick one tie of each color, which would be 5 ties.
  However, if we pick one more tie, we are guaranteed to have at least two ties of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out 6 ties to ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color.

  If A and B are independent events, then the probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.
  Let P(A) be the probability of event A occurring, and P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.
  The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs.
  P(A or B) = 1 - P(neither A nor B)
  P(neither A nor B) = P(A') * P(B')  (since A and B are independent)
  P(A') = 1 - P(A)  (complement of A)
  P(B') = 1 - P(B)  (complement of B)
  Therefore, P(neither A nor B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B))
  We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96
  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  (general addition rule)
  Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

  This is not a valid probability, so we made a mistake somewhere.

  Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  0.6 * P(B) + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B) * P(B) = 0.96
  1.6 * P(B) - 0.6 * P(B) * P(B) = 0.96
  0.6 * P(B) * P(B) - 1.6 * P(B) + 0.96 = 0
  Solving this quadratic equation, we get:

  Let's assume that the height of the building is x meters.
  According to the problem, the flagstaff is 17.5 meters high and casts a shadow of length 40.25 meters.
  We can set up a proportion to solve for x:
  height of flagstaff / length of shadow of flagstaff = height of building / length of shadow of building
  17.5 / 40.25 = x / 28.75
  Solving for x:
  x = 17.5 * 28.75 / 40.25

  The space shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds at maximum speed.
  The space shuttle also takes 5 seconds to pass a point.
  The total time it takes for the space shuttle to travel 700m and pass a point is 40 + 5 = 45 seconds.
  To find the length of the space shuttle, we need to find its speed.
  The speed of the space shuttle is distance/time.
  The distance it travels in 45 seconds is 700m + the length of the space shuttle.
  Therefore, the speed of the space shuttle is (700 + length of space shuttle)/45 m/s.
  We know that the speed of the space shuttle is distance/time = height/time.
  Therefore, the speed of the space shuttle is 700/40 m/s.
  We can equate these two expressions for the speed of the space shuttle and solve for the length of the space shuttle.
  (700 + length of space shuttle)/45 = 700/40

  The space shuttle takes 40 seconds to travel 700m high.
  Therefore, its vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s.
  It takes 5 seconds to pass a point.
  Therefore, the horizontal distance it covers in 40 seconds is (40-5) * v, where v is the horizontal speed of the shuttle.
  The total distance covered by the shuttle in 40 seconds is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with vertical height 700m and horizontal distance (40-5)*v.
  Using Pythagoras theorem, we can find the length of the shuttle.
  Length of the shuttle = sqrt((700^2) + ((40-5)*v)^2)
  We need to find v to calculate the length of the shuttle.
  v = (horizontal distance) / (time taken)
  v = ((40-5)*v) / 35
  v = 1.143v
  Therefore, the horizontal distance covered by the shuttle in 40 seconds is 1.143v * 35 = 40v.
  Length of the shuttle = sqrt((700^2) + (40v)^2)
  We need to find v to calculate the length of the shuttle.
  We can use the fact that the shuttle takes 40 seconds to travel 700m high to find v.
  700 = 0.5 * g * t^2
  t = sqrt((2*700)/g) = 11.83 seconds (time taken to reach maximum height)
  Using the formula v = d/t, where d is the distance covered and t is the time taken, we can find v.
  v = 700/11.83 = 59.12 m/s

- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day was equal to the number of white golf balls sold during the day.
- Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold during the day is equal to 10% of the total inventory (since 10% is half of 20%).

  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then the original price of each article was 300/(x), where x is the original number of articles she could buy.
  If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then the new price of each article is 85% of the original price.
  Anna can now buy 5 more articles, so the new number of articles she can buy is x+5.
  We can set up an equation: 300 = (x+5)(0.85x)
  Solving for x, we get x = 20.

  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then the original price of each article is $300 divided by the original number of articles she could buy.
  Let's call the original price of each article ""x"".
  If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then the new price of each article is 85% of the original price.
  We know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for the same amount of money, which means that the total cost of the articles decreased by 5 times the new price.
  We can set up an equation to solve for the new price:
  Original cost = New cost
  Original number of articles * Original price = (Original number of articles + 5) * New price
  Solving for New price:
  New price = (Original number of articles * Original price) / (Original number of articles + 5)
  New price = (300 / x) / (x + 5)
  New price = 300 / (x * (x + 5))
  New price = 85% of x
  0.85x = 300 / (x * (x + 5))
  x^2 + 5x - 352.94 = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get:
  x = (-5 + sqrt(5^2 - 4*1*(-352.94))) / (2*1) or x = (-5 - sqrt(5^2 - 4*1*(-352.94))) / (2*1)
  x = 13.6 or x = -18.6
  Since the price of an article cannot be negative, the new selling price of each article is $13.6.

  When folded along the width, each part has a perimeter of 66cm, so the width of each part is 33cm.
  The area of the rectangle is l*w.
  We know that l = 2*24 = 48 and w = 2*33 = 66.
  Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 48*66 = 3168.
  When folded in half, we get two equal parts, so the area of each part is 3168/2 = 1584.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively.
  When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2) - b = 24 - b. Therefore, the length of the rectangular sheet is 2(24 - b) = 48 - 2b. Similarly, the breadth of the rectangular sheet is 33 - 2l when folded along the other set of sides.
  We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(l+b). So, we can write two equations as follows:
  2(48 - 2b) = 48 + 33 - 2l
  2l + 2b = 96 - 4b + 66 - 2l
  4l + 6b = 162
  2l + 3b = 81
  We need to find the area of the rectangular sheet which is given by A = lb.
  We can solve the above two equations to find the values of l and b. Then, we can substitute those values in the formula for area to get the answer.
  Let's solve the equations:
  2l + 3b = 81
  2l = 81 - 3b
  l = (81 - 3b)/2
  Substituting this value of l in the first equation:
  4l + 6b = 162
  4[(81 - 3b)/2] + 6b = 162
  162 - 6b + 6b = 162
  Therefore, b = 12
  Substituting this value of b in the equation for l:
  l = (81 - 3b)/2 = (81 - 3(12))/2 = 34.5
  Therefore, the area of the rectangular sheet is lb = 34.5 x 12 = 414

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively.
  When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. Therefore, the length of each part is 24cm.
  When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. Therefore, the length of each part is 33cm.
  Let's consider the first case where the length of each part is 24cm.
  The length of the folded part is l/2 and the breadth of the folded part is b.
  Therefore, the perimeter of the folded part is 2(l/2 + b) = l + 2b = 48cm.
  Similarly, in the second case where the length of each part is 33cm, we get l + 2b = 66cm.
  We have two equations and two variables. We can solve them to get the values of l and b.
  l + 2b = 48  => l = 48 - 2b
  l + 2b = 66  => l = 66 - 2b
  Equating both, we get 48 - 2b = 66 - 2b
  Solving it, we get b = 9cm.
  Substituting the value of b in any of the above equations, we get l = 15cm.
  Therefore, the area of the sheet is l*b = 15*9 = 135 sq.cm.
  The answer is not in the choices. However, we made a mistake in our calculation. We need to double the area as the sheet is folded into two equal halves.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively.
  When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm.
  Therefore, the length of each part is 24cm (since there are two equal parts).
  The length of the rectangular sheet is l, so the breadth of each part is (48-2l)/4 = (24-l)/2.
  When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm.
  Therefore, the breadth of each part is 33/2 = 16.5cm.
  The breadth of the rectangular sheet is b, so the length of each part is (66-2b)/4 = (33-b)/2.
  Since the sheet is folded into two equal halves, the length and breadth of each part are equal.
  Therefore, (24-l)/2 = (33-b)/2.
  Solving for b, we get b = 57/4 - l/2.
  The area of the rectangular sheet is l*b.
  Substituting the value of b in terms of l, we get the area in terms of l.
  Differentiating the area with respect to l and equating it to zero, we get the value of l that maximizes the area.

  Rs. 96 = Rs. 96 + (4*(x-4)) / x-4
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  x = 16

Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is ""x"". 
The total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96.
So, the amount each person would have to contribute is 96/x.
But, 4 people did not turn up, so the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, the new amount each person had to contribute is (96/x) + 4.
The total amount they collected after 4 people did not turn up is still Rs. 96.

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x+y.
  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  If we let x = 1.5 and y = 1.5, then [x] = 1, [y] = 1, [x+y] = 3, [2x] = 3, and [2y] = 3.
  Therefore, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 1 + 1 + 3 = 5, and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 3 + 3 = 6.

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y) to better understand the problem.
  For any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x + y.
  Similarly, [2x] + [2y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y.
  Let's consider the possible values of [x], [y], and [x + y].
  If x is an integer, then [x] = x.
  If x is not an integer, then [x] is the greatest integer less than x, so [x] < x.
  Similarly, if y is an integer, then [y] = y.
  If y is not an integer, then [y] < y.
  If x + y is an integer, then [x + y] = x + y.
  If x + y is not an integer, then [x + y] < x + y.
  Let's consider the possible values of [2x] and [2y].
  If 2x is an integer, then [2x] = 2x.
  If 2x is not an integer, then [2x] < 2x.
  Similarly, if 2y is an integer, then [2y] = 2y.
  If 2y is not an integer, then [2y] < 2y.
  Let's consider the possible cases:
  Case 1: x and y are both integers.
    In this case, [x] = x and [y] = y, so L(x,y) = x + y + [x + y].
    Also, [2x] = 2x and [2y] = 2y, so R(x,y) = 2x + 2y.
    Therefore, L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) for any positive integers x and y.
  Case 2: x is an integer and y is not an integer.
    In this case, [x] = x and [y] < y, so L(x,y) = x + [y] + [x + y].
    Also, [2x] = 2x and [2y] < 2y, so R(x,y) = 2x + [2y].
    Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) for any positive integer x and any positive non-integer y.
  Case 3: x is not an integer and y is an integer.
    In this case, [x] < x and [y] = y, so L(x,y) = [x] + y + [x + y].
    Also, [2x] < 2x and [2y] = 2y, so R(x,y) = [2x] + 2y.
    Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) for any positive non-integer x and any positive integer y.
  Case 4: x and y are both not integers.
    In this case, [x] < x and [y] < y, so L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y].
    Also, [2x] < 2x and [2y] < 2y, so R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  Since [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, we can write x = [x] + {x}, where {x} is the fractional part of x.
  Similarly, we can write y = [y] + {y}.
  Therefore, x + y = [x] + [y] + {x} + {y}.
  Since {x} and {y} are both between 0 and 1, we have {x} + {y} < 2.
  Thus, [x + y] = [x] + [y] if {x} + {y} < 1, and [x + y] = [x] + [y] + 1 if {x} + {y} ≥ 1.
  Now, let's consider the expression L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y].
  If {x} + {y} < 1, then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y].
  If {x} + {y} ≥ 1, then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] + 1 = 2[x] + 2[y] + 1.
  Therefore, we have L(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] or L(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] + 1.
  On the other hand, we have R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 2[x] + 2[y] if {x} < 0.5 and {y} < 0.5, and R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] + 1 otherwise.
  Thus, we have R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] or R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] + 1.
  Now, let's consider each choice:
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y) is impossible because L(x,y) and R(x,y) can differ by at most 1.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y) is always true because L(x,y) and R(x,y) can differ by at most 1.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y) is possible if {x} < 0.5 and {y} < 0.5, in which case L(x,y) = R(x,y) - 1.

  Let's assume the two numbers are x and y.
  According to the problem, we have two equations:
  x^2 - y^2 = 256000  (Equation 1)
  x + y = 1000        (Equation 2)
  We can use Equation 2 to solve for one of the variables, say x:
  x = 1000 - y
  We can substitute this expression for x into Equation 1:
  (1000 - y)^2 - y^2 = 256000
  Simplifying this equation, we get:

  Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
  y^2 - 1000y + 128000 = 0
  We can solve for y using the quadratic formula:
  y = (1000 ± √(1000^2 - 4*128000)) / 2
  y = (1000 ± √(600000)) / 2
  y = (1000 ± 200√15) / 2

    2x^2 + 2000x - 1256000 = 0
    x^2 + 1000x - 628000 = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get:

    x = (-1000 ± sqrt(3968000)) / 2
    x = (-1000 ± 1992.03) / 2
  Therefore, the two possible values of x are:
    x = (-1000 + 1992.03) / 2 = 496.015
    x = (-1000 - 1992.03) / 2 = -996.015

  The revenue from selling each component is the selling price.
  Let's assume the selling price is x.
  The revenue from selling 420 units is 420x.
  The yearly revenue from selling 420 units every month is 12*420x = 5040x.
  The yearly production cost is 12*420*110 = 554,400.
  The yearly profit is the difference between the yearly revenue and the yearly production cost.
  The yearly profit should be at least $626,400.
  Therefore, 5040x - 554,400 >= 626,400.
  Solving for x, we get x >= 230.
  The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $230.

  A starts from a point and travels south 3km. This means A is 3km away from the starting point.
  Then A travels 5km towards east. This means A is 5km away from the starting point towards east.
  After that, A travels 3km towards north. This means A is 3km away from the starting point towards north.
  Finally, A travels 2km towards west. This means A is 2km away from the starting point towards west.
  We can draw a diagram to visualize the path taken by A.

  We can see that A has formed a rectangle with sides 3km, 5km, 3km, and 2km.
  To find the distance between A and the starting point, we need to find the length of the diagonal of this rectangle.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.
  The diagonal is the square root of (3^2 + 5^2) = square root of 34.

  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b)) = ((a + b)(a - b))/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b)

  Simplifying the right-hand side using the identity (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2, we get:

  44c = 297 - 3(a - c) + (b - c)
  Since M > 300, a >= 3.
  If a > c, then a - c >= 1, so 44c >= 294, which implies c >= 7.

  If a = 5, then b can be any digit, so there are 10 possible values of b.

  After simplification, we get 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Simplifying further, we get 4(a - c) + 16c = 40.
  Rearranging, we get a - c = 10 - 4c.
  Since a > c, we know that 10 - 4c > 0, so c < 2.5.
  Therefore, c can only be 0 or 1.
  If c = 0, then a = 4 and a - c = 4.
  If c = 1, then a can be either 3 or 4, and a - c = 2 or 3.
  So there are a total of 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 values of M that are more than 300.

  M - N + 396c = 990
  (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990

  We can write M - N as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99(a - c).
  Therefore, 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 11(a - c) + 4c = 10.
  Since a > b, we know that a > 3 (because M > 300).
  If a = 4, then c = 2, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 7 (since a > b).
  If a = 5, then c = 1, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 8.
  If a = 6, then c = 3, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 5.
  If a = 7, then c = 2, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 6.
  If a = 8, then c = 1, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 7.
  If a = 9, then c = 4, which means b can be any digit from 0 to 4.

  We know that M is a three-digit number and N is the reverse of M.
  Let's write M and N in expanded form:
    M = 100a + 10b + c
    N = 100c + 10b + a
  We also know that M > N, so:
    100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a
    99a > 99c
    a > c
  Since a and c are digits, the possible values for (a, c) are:
    (2, 0), (3, 0), ..., (9, 0)
    (3, 1), (4, 1), ..., (9, 1)
    ...
    (8, 7), (9, 7)
    (9, 8)
  There are 9 + 8 + ... + 1 = 45 pairs of (a, c).
  For each pair of (a, c), we can choose any digit for b, except 0 (because M is a three-digit number).
  So there are 9 choices for b.
  Therefore, there are 45 x 9 = 405 possible values of M.
  We need to find how many values of M are more than 300 and satisfy the equation M - N + 396c = 990.
  Let's simplify the equation:
    M - N + 396c = 990
    (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 990
    99a - 99c + 397c = 990
    99a + 298c = 990
    33a + 99c = 330
    a + 3c = 10
  Since a > c, the possible values for (a, c) that satisfy the equation are:
    (4, 2), (5, 1), (6, 0)
  For each pair of (a, c), we can choose any digit for b except 0.
  So there are 9 choices for b.
  Therefore, there are 3 x 9 = 27 values of M that satisfy the equation.
  Out of these 27 values, only 4 values are less than 300: 421, 531, 641, 751.

  Subtracting -50 from both sides, we get:

  We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is the average of the integers multiplied by k.

  Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
  When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece become (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
  The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to form two triangles, each with an area of 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height.
  Since the two triangles are congruent, they have the same base and height.
  Let's call the base and height of each triangle ""b"" and ""h"", respectively.
  Then, (1/2)bh = 70, which means bh = 140.
  The base of each triangle is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs x-4 and h.
  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can write: (x-4)^2 + h^2 = b^2.
  Since b = h, we can simplify this to: 2h^2 = (x-4)^2.
  Substituting bh = 140, we get: 2(140/h) = (x-4)^2.
  Solving for h, we get: h = sqrt[(280/(x-4))].
  Substituting this into the equation for the base of the triangle, we get: b = sqrt[(280(x-4))]/(x-4).

Checking Answer Choice A:
  If x = 14, then the area of the rectangular piece is (14-4) x 14 = 140 square feet.
  The height of each triangle is h = sqrt[(280/(14-4))] = 2sqrt[70].
  The base of each triangle is b = sqrt[(280(14-4))]/(14-4) = 2sqrt[70].
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x = 56.
  This is a possible answer.
  
Checking Answer Choice B:
  If x = 15, then the area of the rectangular piece is (15-4) x 15 = 165 square feet.
  The height of each triangle is h = sqrt[(280/(15-4))] = sqrt[280/11].
  The base of each triangle is b = sqrt[(280(15-4))]/(15-4) = sqrt[280/11] * 11/4.

  The area of the parking space is L * W * 9.
  We can rewrite L * W as (L + W)^2 - (L - W)^2.
  We know L + W = 28, so (L + W)^2 = 784.
  We need to find L - W to calculate (L - W)^2.
  We can solve for L and W using the equation L + W = 28 and L - W = x.
  Adding these two equations, we get 2L = 28 + x, or L = 14 + x/2.
  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get 2W = 28 - x, or W = 14 - x/2.
  We can substitute these expressions for L and W into the equation for the area of the parking space.
  Simplifying, we get A = 9(784 - x^2/4).
  To maximize the area, we need to minimize x^2/4.
  Since x is a difference, the smallest possible value of x is 0, which gives us L = W = 14.
  Therefore, the area of the parking space is A = 9(14^2) = 1764 square feet.

  We know that c = 9 feet.
  We also know that a + b + c = 37 feet.
  We can substitute c with 9 in the second equation and get a + b = 28.
  We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = l * w, where l is the length and w is the width.
  We know that l = a and w = b, so A = a * b.
  We need to find a and b to calculate the area.
  We can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter.
  We know that a + b = 28, so 2a + 2b = 56.
  We can divide both sides by 2 to get a + b = 28 again.
  We can solve the system of equations a + b = 28 and a * b = A to find a and b.
  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for a and b.
  The quadratic equation is x^2 - (a + b)x + ab = 0.
  We can substitute a + b with 28 and ab with A to get x^2 - 28x + A = 0.
  We can solve for x using the quadratic formula, which is x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.
  We can substitute a = 1, b = -28, and c = A to get x = (28 ± sqrt(784 - 4A)) / 2.
  We can simplify this to x = 14 ± sqrt(196 - A).
  We know that x is positive, so we can use x = 14 + sqrt(196 - A).
  We can substitute a + b = 28 to get b = 28 - a.
  We can substitute b with 28 - a in the equation x = a * b to get x = a(28 - a).
  We can substitute x with 14 + sqrt(196 - A) to get 14 + sqrt(196 - A) = a(28 - a).
  We can simplify this to a^2 - 28a + (A - 182) = 0.
  We can solve for a using the quadratic formula, which is a = (28 ± sqrt(784 - 4(A - 182))) / 2.
  We can simplify this to a = 14 ± sqrt(196 + A - 182).
  We know that a is positive, so we can use a = 14 + sqrt(196 + A - 182).
  We can substitute a with 14 + sqrt(196 + A - 182) in the equation b = 28 - a to get b = 14 - sqrt(196 + A - 182).
  We can substitute a and b in the equation A = a * b to get A = (14 + sqrt(196 + A - 182))(14 - sqrt(196 + A - 182)).

  Let's assume that the length of the painted sides is L and W.
  The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet.
  The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet.
  Therefore, L + W + 9 = 37.
  L + W = 28.
  The area of the parking space is A = L * W.
  We need to find the value of A.
  We know that L + W = 28.
  We also know that (L + W)^2 = L^2 + W^2 + 2*L*W.
  Therefore, L^2 + W^2 + 2*L*W = 28^2.
  We can rewrite this equation as L^2 + W^2 = (28^2 - 2*L*W).
  We need to find the value of A = L * W.
  We can use the equation L^2 + W^2 = (28^2 - 2*L*W) to solve for L*W.
  We know that (L - W)^2 = L^2 + W^2 - 2*L*W.
  Therefore, L*W = (L^2 + W^2 - (L - W)^2)/2.
  We know that L + W = 28.
  Therefore, (L - W)^2 = L^2 + W^2 - 2*L*W = 28^2 - 4*L*W.
  We can substitute this value in the equation for A.
  A = (L^2 + W^2 - (L - W)^2)/2 = (2*L*W)/2 = L*W = (28^2 - (L - W)^2)/4.
  We know that L + W = 28.
  Therefore, (L - W)^2 = L^2 + W^2 - 2*L*W = 28^2 - 4*L*W.
  We can substitute this value in the equation for A.
  A = (28^2 - (L - W)^2)/4 = (28^2 - (28^2 - 4*L*W))/4 = (4*L*W)/4 = L*W.
  We need to find the value of L*W.
  We know that L + W = 28.
  Therefore, L*W = L*(28 - L) = -L^2 + 28*L.
  We need to find the value of -L^2 + 28*L.
  We can complete the square to find the maximum value of -L^2 + 28*L.
  -L^2 + 28*L = -(L^2 - 28*L) = -(L^2 - 28*L + 196) + 196 = -((L - 14)^2 - 196) + 196 = 196 - (L - 14)^2.
  Therefore, the maximum value of -L^2 + 28*L is 196.
  Therefore, the maximum value of L*W is 196.
  Therefore, the area of the parking space is between 0 and 196 square feet.

  We also know that the area of the rectangle is A = L x W
  We need to find the value of A.
  We can use the formula A = (L + W) x (L - W + 9) / 2
  Substituting L + W = 28, we get A = (28 x (L - W + 9)) / 2
  Simplifying, we get A = 14 x (L - W + 9)

  Let's assume that hose A fills 1/x of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, hose A can fill the entire pool in 8 hours, which means that 8/x of the pool is filled in 1 hour.
  For the first 2 hours, hose A fills 2/x of the pool.
  In the next 3 hours, both hoses fill the remaining 6/x of the pool.
  Let's assume that hose B fills 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, both hoses together can fill 1/x + 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  We know that both hoses together filled 6/x of the pool in 3 hours.
  Therefore, 1/x + 1/y = 6/(3x) = 2/x.
  So, 1/y = 2/x - 1/x = 1/x.

  Let's assume that hose A can fill the pool in 'a' hours and hose B can fill the pool in 'b' hours.
  Therefore, the rate of hose A = 1/a and the rate of hose B = 1/b.
  Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so the amount of water filled by hose A in 2 hours = 2/a.
  The remaining amount of water that needs to be filled = 1 - 2/a = (a-2)/a.
  The two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours, so the amount of water filled by both hoses in 3 hours = 3(1/a + 1/b).
  Therefore, the amount of water filled by hose B in 3 hours = 3(1/a + 1/b) - 2 = (3b + 3a - 2ab)/ab.
  We know that the amount of water filled by hose B in 3 hours = (a-2)/a.
  Therefore, (3b + 3a - 2ab)/ab = (a-2)/a.
  Solving this equation, we get b = 12.

  The number of deer tagged in 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 is 500.
  The number of deer caught in 2002 with tags from 2001 is 20.
  The percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags.
  Therefore, we can set up a proportion to solve for the total deer population.
  Let x be the total deer population.
  (20/500) = (300/x)
  Solving for x, we get x = 7500.

2272 = 2 * 875 + 522
875 = 1 * 522 + 353
522 = 1 * 353 + 169
353 = 2 * 169 + 15

HCF(2272, 875) = 1

Since the remainder is the same, we can say that N is a factor of (2272 - 875) = 1397.

The factors of 1397 are 1, 17,  19, 41, and 1397.

Let's check which of these factors satisfy the condition that the remainder is the same when dividing 2272 and 875 by N.

When N = 1, the remainder is 0 for both 2272 and 875, so this is not possible.

When N = 17, the remainder when dividing 2272 by 17 is 4, and the remainder when dividing 875 by 17 is 6.

When N = 19, the remainder when dividing 2272 by 19 is 1, and the remainder when dividing 875 by 19 is 1.

When N = 41, the remainder when dividing 2272 by 41 is 9, and the remainder when dividing 875 by 41 is 9.

When N = 1397, the remainder is 0 for both 2272 and 875, so this is not possible.

The sum of the digits of N = 17 is 1 + 7 = 8.
The sum of the digits of N = 19 is 1 + 9 = 10.
The sum of the digits of N = 41 is 4 + 1 = 5.

  Let's assume that the total work is 12 units (LCM of 3 and 12).
  Jack finished 8 units of work (two-thirds of 12 units) in 8 * 1/12 = 2/3 hours.
  The remaining one-third of the work is 4 units of work.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate of cleaning is 1/20 of the yacht per hour.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work.
  Therefore, Jill can finish 1/x of the yacht per hour.
  Using the work formula, we can set up the equation:
  Jack's work + Jill's work = Total work
  8(1/12) + 4(1/x) = 12
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  2/3 + 1/x = 3/2
  1/x = 3/2 - 2/3
  1/x = 5/6
  x = 6/5
  Therefore, it takes Jill 6/5 hours to finish the remaining work.

  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means that one-third of the work is left.
  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yachts per hour.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning = 5/100 * 1/12 yachts per hour = 1/240 yachts per hour.
  Using the formula: rate = work / time, we can set up the equation:
  Jack's rate * (2/3) + Jill's rate * (1/3) = 1 yacht
  (1/12) * (2/3) + (1/240) * x * (1/3) = 1

  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which means that he has one-third of the work left to do.
  If Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, then he can clean one-third of the yacht in 4 hours.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.
  Therefore, Jill can clean one-fifth of what Jack can do in the same amount of time.
  If Jack can clean one-third of the yacht in 4 hours, then Jill can clean one-fifth of that in the same amount of time.
  One-fifth of one-third is one-fifteenth.
  Therefore, Jill can clean one-fifteenth of the yacht in one hour.
  If Jill can clean one-fifteenth of the yacht in one hour, then she can clean one-third of the yacht in 15 hours.

  Let's assume the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city is 'x' hours.
  The time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car to the city is 'y' hours.
  The total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city and return by car is 17 hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is (17 - x) hours.
  The total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel both ways by train is (2x - 4) hours.
  We know that the total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city and return by car is 17 hours.
  Therefore, (2x - 4) + y = 17.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 2x + y = 21.
  We also know that the total time taken by Mr. Sam to travel both ways by car is (2y) hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways is (2y) hours.
  We need to find the value of '2y'.
  Let's substitute the value of 'y' from the equation 2x + y = 21.
  We get, 2y = 42 - 4x.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways is (2y) = (42 - 4x) hours.
  We need to find the value of 'x' to calculate the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways.
  Let's solve the equation 2x + y = 21 to find the value of 'x'.
  We get, x = (21 - y)/2.
  Substituting the value of 'x' in the equation (42 - 4x), we get the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways.
  We get, (42 - 4x) = (42 - 2(21 - y))/2.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get (42 - 4x) = y.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways is y = (42 - 4x) hours.
  Let's substitute the value of 'x' in the above equation to get the value of 'y'.
  We get, y = (42 - 4(21 - 2x))/2.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get y = (8 - x).
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways is (2y) = 2(8 - x) = 16 - 2x hours.
  To minimize the time taken by Mr. Sam, we need to find the value of 'x' that minimizes the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by train to the city and return by car.
  Let's differentiate the equation (2x - 4) + y = 17 with respect to 'x' and equate it to zero to find the value of 'x' that minimizes the time taken by Mr. Sam.
  We get, 2 - (dy/dx) = 0.
  Therefore, (dy/dx) = 2.
  We know that y = (8 - x).
  Therefore, (dy/dx) = -1.
  Equating (dy/dx) = -1 to 2, we get x = 3.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways is (2y) = 16 - 2x = 10 hours.

  Therefore, the total amount of money she got from copper coins is 20x cents, and the total amount of money she got from brass coins is 25y cents.
  According to the problem, after one dive, she got $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve the equation for different values of y and see which value of y gives us a whole number for x.
  If y = 0, then 20x = 340, which means x = 17. This is not a whole number, so we can eliminate this option.
  If y = 1, then 20x + 25 = 340, which means 20x = 315, which means x = 15.75. This is not a whole number, so we can eliminate this option.
  If y = 2, then 20x + 50 = 340, which means 20x = 290, which means x = 14.5. This is not a whole number, so we can eliminate this option.
  If y = 3, then 20x + 75 = 340, which means 20x = 265, which means x = 13.25. This is not a whole number, so we can eliminate this option.
  If y = 4, then 20x + 100 = 340, which means 20x = 240, which means x = 12. This is a whole number, so this is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 4.

  We can use these equations to solve for a, b, and c.

  We can use this equation to solve for ""abc"".
  Let's start by solving for a, b, and c.
  From the first equation, we know that c = 17 - a - b.
  We can substitute this into the second equation to get a^2 + b^2 + (17 - a - b)^2 = 109.
  Expanding this equation gives us 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 34a - 34b + 578 = 0.
  Simplifying this equation gives us a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 17a - 17b + 289 = 0.
  We can substitute c = 17 - a - b into this equation to get a^2 + b^2 + (17 - a - b)^2 - 17a - 17b + 289 = 0.
  Expanding this equation gives us 3a^2 + 3b^2 - 34a - 34b + 578 = 0.
  Simplifying this equation gives us a^2 + b^2 - 11a - 11b + 192 = 0.
  We can use trial and error to solve for a and b. We know that a and b must be integers between 1 and 9, inclusive.
  After trying different values of a and b, we find that a = 4 and b = 6.
  We can substitute these values into the first equation to get c = 7.

  We can use these equations to solve for a, b, and c.
  From the first equation, we can solve for a in terms of b and c: a = 17 - b - c.
  Substituting this into the second equation and simplifying, we get: 2b^2 + 2c^2 - 34b - 34c + 90 = 0.
  We can rewrite this equation as: (b - 9)^2 + (c - 9)^2 = 10.
  The only possible values for b and c that satisfy this equation are (0, 1), (1, 0), (3, 7), and (7, 3).
  However, we know that a + b + c = 17, so the only possible values for (a, b, c) are (8, 3, 6) and (9, 7, 1).
  We can check both of these values to see which one satisfies abc - 495 = cba.

  We can use this equation along with a + b + c = 17 to solve for a, b, and c.
  From a - c = 5, we can see that a and c differ by 5.
  Since a + b + c = 17, we know that a, b, and c are not all odd or all even.
  Therefore, a and c must be 6 and 1 in some order.
  If a = 6 and c = 1, then b = 10 - 7 = 3.

  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given.
  Let the number of files infected only by a virus be V.
  Let the number of files infected only by a worm be W.
  Let the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm be VW.
  We know that V + W + VW = 250.
  We also know that W = 2.5VW.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V + VW = 0.5(250) = 125.
  We can use the second equation to substitute for W in terms of VW: W = 2.5VW = 5/2(VW).
  Substituting for W in the first equation, we get V + 5/2(VW) + VW = 250.
  Simplifying, we get 7/2(VW) + V = 250.
  Substituting for V in terms of VW using the third equation, we get 7/2(VW) + 0.5(250 - VW) = 250.

    - w + v + b = 250
    - 2.5b + v + b = 250

  We can substitute this expression for v in the first equation:
    - w = 2.5b
    - w = 2.5(b) = 2.5(125 - v)
    - w = 312.5 - 2.5v
  Now we can substitute these expressions for w and v in the third equation:

    - w = 703.125 - 6.25v
  We want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm. This is equal to the number of files that were either not infected at all or infected only by a virus. We know that:
    - v + b = 125

    - 2v + 562.5 - 2.5v = 250
    - -0.5v = -312.5
    - v = 625
  We can substitute this value for v in the expression for b:

    - b = (562.5 - 2.5(625)) / 2
    - b = 0

  We know that Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78 kmph.
  We can use the formula distance = speed x time to form two equations.

  Let's calculate the distance covered in the return journey: Distance = (x+12) km/hr x 4 hrs = 4(x+12) km
  Since the distances are equal, we can equate the two expressions:
  6x = 4(x+12)
  6x = 4x + 48
  2x = 48
  x = 24
  Therefore, the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is 24 km/hr.
  Let's calculate the distance covered in the forward journey: Distance = x km/hr x 6 hrs = 24 km/hr x 6 hrs = 144 km

  Train M travels for 4 hours from City A to City B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours from City B to City A.
  The total time between the departure of train M and the arrival of train N is 4 + 3.5 = 7.5 hours.
  The two trains will cross each other when they have traveled the same distance.
  Let's say the two trains meet after x hours of Train M's journey.
  In x hours, Train M travels (4/x) times the distance between City A and City B.
  In (7.5 - x) hours, Train N travels (3.5/(7.5 - x)) times the distance between City A and City B.
  We know that the two distances are equal.
  Therefore, (4/x) = (3.5/(7.5 - x)).
  Solving for x, we get x = 2.5.
  Therefore, the two trains cross each other 2.5 hours after Train M's departure, which is at 7:30 am.

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours after 5am.
  Distance travelled by Train M in x hours = Distance travelled by Train N in x-2 hours (since Train N started 2 hours later)
  Distance = Speed x Time
  Let's assume the speed of both trains is S.
  Distance travelled by Train M in x hours = Sx
  Distance travelled by Train N in x-2 hours = S(x-2)
  Total distance travelled by both trains = Distance between City A and City B = 2S
  Therefore, Sx + S(x-2) = 2S

  Train M travels for 4 hours before it reaches City B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours before it reaches City A.
  The total time between 5 am and 10:30 am is 5.5 hours.
  The two trains are moving towards each other.
  The relative speed of the two trains is the sum of their speeds.
  We can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the distance between the two cities.
  Let's assume the distance between the two cities is ""d"".
  Train M covers a distance of ""d"" in 4 hours.
  Train N covers a distance of ""d"" in 3.5 hours.
  The total distance covered by both trains is ""2d"".
  We can use the formula distance = speed x time to find the time taken by the two trains to meet.
  Let's assume the speed of train M is ""x"" and the speed of train N is ""y"".
  The relative speed of the two trains is ""x + y"".
  We can use the formula time = distance / speed to find the time taken by the two trains to meet.
  The time taken by train M to meet train N is 2d / (x + y).
  We need to find the time in minutes.
  Let's convert the time to minutes.
  2d / (x + y) = (2d / (x + y)) * (60 min / 1 hr) = 120d / (x + y) min.
  We need to find the value of ""120d / (x + y)"".
  We can find the value of ""d"" using the formula distance = speed x time.
  The distance covered by train M in 4 hours is ""d"".
  Therefore, the speed of train M is ""d / 4"".
  The distance covered by train N in 3.5 hours is ""d"".
  Therefore, the speed of train N is ""d / 3.5"".
  The relative speed of the two trains is (d / 4) + (d / 3.5) = (8.75d / 35) + (10d / 35) = (18.75d / 35).
  The time taken by the two trains to meet is 120d / (18.75d / 35) = 224 min.

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) from City A to City B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) from City B to City A.
  Let's assume that the two trains cross each other x hours after Train N leaves City B.
  Therefore, Train M would have traveled for (x+2) hours (since it left 2 hours before Train N) when the two trains cross each other.
  We know that the distance traveled by both trains is the same.
  Let's assume that the distance between City A and City B is d.
  Therefore, the speed of Train M is d/(x+2) and the speed of Train N is d/3.5.
  We can use the formula: distance = speed x time to solve for x.
  distance traveled by Train M = (x+2) * (d/(x+2)) = d
  distance traveled by Train N = 3.5 * (d/3.5) - x * (d/(x+2)) = d
  Solving for x, we get x = 7/3 hours = 2 hours and 20 minutes after 7am.
  Therefore, the two trains cross each other at 9:20am.

  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that J + F = 2S.
  Finally, we know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that J + F = 2(S - F).
  We can use these equations to solve for F.
  Simplifying the second equation, we get S = (J + F)/2.
  Substituting this into the first equation, we get J + (J + F)/2 + F = 100.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 3J/2 + 3F/2 = 100, or 3J + 3F = 200.
  Using the third equation, we can substitute J + F = 2S to get J + F = 2(S - F), or J + F = 2J + 2F - 4F, or J - F = F.
  Adding this equation to 3J + 3F = 200, we get 4J = 201, or J = 50.25.
  Substituting this into J + F = 2S, we get 50.25 + F = 2S, or S = (50.25 + F)/2.
  Substituting this into J + S + F = 100, we get 50.25 + F + (50.25 + F)/2 = 100.

  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume x is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father.
  Then, J + x = F + x, which means J = F.
  Also, S + x = 2S, which means S = x.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume y is the number of years ago when Joe's sister was as old as her father.
  Then, F - y = 2(S - y).
  We have three equations and three unknowns, which we can solve to find F.
  J + S + F = 100
  J = F
  F - y = 2(S - y)
  Substituting J = F and S = x into the third equation, we get:
  F - y = 2(x - y)
  Simplifying the equations, we get:
  J + S + F = 100
  J = F
  F - 2S + y = 0
  Substituting J = F into the first equation, we get:
  J + S + J = 100
  2J + S = 100
  Substituting S = x into the second equation, we get:
  F - 2x + y = 0
  Substituting J = F into the third equation, we get:
  J - 2x + y = 0
  Adding the second and third equations, we get:
  F + J - 4x + 2y = 0
  Substituting J = F into the above equation, we get:
  2F - 4x + 2y = 0
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  F = 2x - y
  Substituting F = J into the first equation, we get:
  2J + S = 100
  Substituting J = F into the above equation, we get:
  3F + S = 100
  Substituting S = x into the above equation, we get:
  3F + x = 100
  Substituting F = 2x - y into the above equation, we get:
  3(2x - y) + x = 100
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  7x - 3y = 100
  We need to find F, which is 2x - y.
  We have two equations and two unknowns:
  7x - 3y = 100
  2x - y = F
  Solving the second equation for y, we get:
  y = 2x - F
  Substituting y = 2x - F into the first equation, we get:
  7x - 3(2x - F) = 100
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  x = (F + 300) / 11
  We know that x, F, and y are integers.
  Therefore, F + 300 must be divisible by 11.

  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) or F - J = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Solving for S, we get S = (F - J) / 3.
  Substituting S in the second equation, we get F - J = 2F - 2S or F - J = 2F - 2((F - J) / 3) or F - J = (4F - 2J) / 3.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 3F - 3J = 4F - 2J or F = J + 3J = 4J.
  Substituting F = 4J in the first equation, we get J + S + 4J = 100 or S = 95 - 5J.
  Substituting S = (F - J) / 3, we get (F - J) / 3 = 95 - 5J or F - J = 285 - 15J.
  Substituting F = 4J, we get 3J = 285 or J = 95.
  Substituting J = 95 in S = 95 - 5J, we get S = 70.
  Substituting J = 95 and F = 4J, we get F = 380.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 380.

  Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph, so the time it took him to get from B to A is d/90.
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already traveled a total of d-70 miles at that point.
  We also know that he had 3 hours left to complete his trip, which means that he had already spent (d/70 + d/90) - 3 hours traveling.
  We can use these two pieces of information to set up an equation and solve for d.
  (d/70 + d/90) - 3 = (d-70)/90
  Solving for d, we get d = 360.
  Therefore, the distance between A and B is 360 miles.

  Let's solve for ""abcde"".

  10000a + 1000b + 100c - 10d - e = 50000
  1000(10a + b) + 10(10c + d) + (10e - e) = 50000
  1000(10a + b) + 10(10c + d) + 9e = 50000
  1000(10a + b) + 10(10c + d) = 50000 - 9e
  100(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 5000 - (9/10)e
  100(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 5000 - e + (e - (9/10)e)
  100(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 5000 - e + (1/10)e
  100(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 5000 + (1/10)e
  From the equation, we can see that e must be 5, because the number is a 5-digit number.
  Substituting e = 5, we get:
  100(10a + b) + (10c + d) = 5050
  10(10a + b) + (c + d) = 505
  We know that a, b, c, d, and e are digits, so they must be between 0 and 9.
  We can try different values of a, b, c, and d to see which ones satisfy the equation.
  If we let a = 4, b = 2, c = 8, and d = 5, we get:

Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
Each son receives 5 times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.
The total number of recipients is 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11.
The sum of the amounts received by all recipients is Rs 8600.
So, we can write the equation: 
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
Simplifying the equation, we get:

  Let's assume there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  Let x be the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  We can create an equation using the information above: 
  x + 40 = Q (the number of employees who take a summer vacation)
  100 - 20 - 75 - x = Q (the number of employees who take a vacation)
  Simplifying the second equation: 5 = Q - x

  Let's assume that the total number of employees in the company is 100.
  75 percent of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40 percent of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20 percent of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take only a winter vacation and the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's assume that x percent of the employees take only a winter vacation.
  Then, (75 - x) percent of the employees take a summer vacation.
  We know that 40 employees take both vacations, so the number of employees who take only a winter vacation is (75 - x) - 40 = 35 - x.
  We also know that 20 employees take neither vacation, so the number of employees who take at least one vacation is 100 - 20 = 80.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take only a winter vacation plus the number of employees who take only a summer vacation plus the number of employees who take both vacations is equal to 80.
  (35 - x) + (75 - x) + 40 = 80
  110 - 2x = 80
  2x = 30
  x = 15
  So, 15 percent of the employees take only a winter vacation, and (75 - 15) = 60 percent of the employees take a summer vacation.
  Let's assume that y percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Then, 60 - y percent of the employees take both vacations.
  We know that (35 - x) = 20 percent of the employees take only a summer vacation.
  Therefore, y percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is equal to (60 - y) - 35 = 25 - y.

  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's assume that Q percent of employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  The number of employees who take a summer vacation is (100 - 20)% = 80% of the total employees = 80 employees.
  The number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations is 40.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (80 - 40) = 40 employees.
  We can find the value of Q by dividing the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation by the total number of employees and multiplying by 100.

  40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither winter nor summer vacations, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can calculate the number of employees who take a winter vacation only by subtracting the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees who take a winter vacation. So, 75 - 40 = 35 employees take a winter vacation only.
  The number of employees who take a summer vacation is the total number of employees who take both vacations minus the number of employees who take neither vacation. So, 40 - 20 = 20 employees take a summer vacation.

To solve the problem, we need to find out how many helpers are required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. 

One helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour, so 20 large cakes can be made by 10 helpers in 5 hours (2 large cakes per hour per helper * 10 helpers * 5 hours = 100 large cakes).

One helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour, so 700 small cakes can be made by 20 helpers in 20 hours (35 small cakes per hour per helper * 20 helpers * 20 hours = 14,000 small cakes).

Since we only have 3 hours to work with, we need to find the number of helpers required to make both large and small cakes in that time.

Let's assume x helpers are needed to make 20 large cakes in 3 hours. Then, each helper can make 20/3 = 6.67 large cakes in 3 hours.

Similarly, each helper can make 35/60 * 3 = 1.75 small cakes in 3 hours.

So, the total number of large cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours = 6.67x
The total number of small cakes made by x helpers in 3 hours = 1.75x

We need to find x such that 6.67x >= 20 and 1.75x >= 700.

Solving the first inequality, we get x >= 3 (rounded up from 2.994).

  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile-long tunnel.
  The train's length plus the tunnel's length is equal to 1 mile.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: distance = rate x time (d = rt) to solve the problem.
  The train's speed is 120 miles per hour, which is 2 miles per minute.
  Let's assume the length of the train is x miles.
  The train needs to travel a distance of (1 + x) miles to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can set up the equation: (1 + x) = 2t, where t is the time it takes for the train to pass through the tunnel.
  Solving for x, we get x = 1 - 2t.
  Substituting x into the equation, we get 1 - 2t = 120t/60.
  Simplifying the equation, we get t = 20 seconds.
  Therefore, the answer is C: 20 seconds.

  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, which is 1 mile long.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: distance = rate x time.
  The distance traveled by the train is the length of the tunnel, which is 1 mile.
  We need to convert the speed of the train from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  Then we can use the formula to find the time it takes for the train to pass through the tunnel.
Calculation:
  Speed of train = 120 miles per hour / 3600 seconds per hour = 1/30 miles per second
  Distance = 1 mile
  Time = Distance / Speed = 1 / (1/30) = 30 seconds
Result:
  It will take 30 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.

  To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.
  The maximum number of unique colors we can select is 1 more than the number of ties we select.
  We want to select the minimum number of ties to satisfy the condition.
  We can start by selecting one tie of each color, which would give us 5 ties.
  To ensure we have at least two ties of the same color, we need to select one more tie.
  The next tie we select will either match one of the colors we already have, or it will be a new color.
  Therefore, we need to select at least 6 ties to ensure we have at least two ties of the same color.

  The total cost of the 10 articles is $300, so 10 * new price = $300.
  Therefore, new price = $300 / 10 = $30.
  We know that new price = 0.85x, so we can solve for x: x = new price / 0.85 = $35.29.
  Therefore, the new selling price of each article is $30.

  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then the original price of each article was $300/(number of articles) before the price decreased.
  Let x be the original price of each article.
  If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then the new price is 85% of the original price.
  The new price of each article can be calculated by dividing the total cost by the new number of articles.
  The new number of articles is 5 more than the original number of articles.
  Therefore, the new number of articles is (total cost)/(0.85x) + 5.
  Setting the two expressions for the new number of articles equal, we get:
  (total cost)/(0.85x) + 5 = number of articles
  Substituting the given values, we get:
  300/(0.85x) + 5 = number of articles
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 16
  Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 85% of $16, which is $13.6.
  The answer is C: $13.6.

  The length of the folded part is 'l' and the breadth of the folded part is 'b/2'.
  Therefore, the perimeter of each part is 2(l + b/2) = 2l + b = 66.
  Substituting the value of l from the first equation, we get 2(48 - 2b) + b = 66.
  Solving the equation, we get b = 12cm and l = 24cm.
  Therefore, the area of the sheet is l * b = 24 * 12 = 288 sq.cm.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are l and b respectively.
  When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm.
  Therefore, the length of each part is 24cm (since the length is folded into two equal halves).
  Hence, 2l + 2b = 48, which gives l + b = 24.
  Similarly, when folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm.
  Therefore, the breadth of each part is 33cm (since the breadth is folded into two equal halves).
  Hence, 2l + 2b = 66, which gives l + b = 33/2.
  We can solve these two equations to get l and b.
  Once we have l and b, we can find the area of the rectangular sheet.

  Let's assume the length of the sheet is l and the width is w.
  When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So, the length of each part is 24cm. Therefore, the length of the sheet is 2*24 = 48cm. Hence, l = 48cm.
  When folded along the width, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So, the width of each part is 33cm. Therefore, the width of the sheet is 2*33 = 66cm. Hence, w = 66cm.
  The area of the sheet is l*w = 48*66 = 3168 sq.cm.
  But, we need to find the area of the sheet when it is folded into two equal halves.
  When folded along the length, the area of each part is l*w/2 = 48*33 = 1584 sq.cm.
  When folded along the width, the area of each part is l*w/2 = 24*66 = 1584 sq.cm.

  Let x be the number of students in the school.

  The number of students who took physics and math is the intersection of the two sets, which is 20% of x intersect 28% of x.
  We can find the intersection by multiplying the two percentages and the total number of students (x).
  20% of x = 0.2x

  Therefore, the total number of students is N = P + M + (some students who did not take either physics or math).
  We want to find the least possible value of N that satisfies the given conditions.
  Since P and M are integers, we can try different values of P and M that satisfy the given conditions and see which value of N gives the least possible value.
  If P = 101 and M = 140, then N = P + M + (some students who did not take either physics or math) = 101 + 140 + (some students who did not take either physics or math) = 241 + (some students who did not take either physics or math).

     Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 2[x + y].
     Simplifying, we get [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y] + 2[x + y].
     This implies [x] + [y] < [2x] + [2y], which is not possible for any positive real numbers x and y.
     Therefore, option C is not possible.
  D: This option is the opposite of option C, which we have already shown to be not possible.

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y) to better understand them.
  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Therefore, [x] ≤ x < [x] + 1.
  [y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to y. Therefore, [y] ≤ y < [y] + 1.
  [x + y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y. Therefore, [x + y] ≤ x + y < [x + y] + 1.
  [2x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x. Therefore, [2x] ≤ 2x < [2x] + 1.
  [2y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y. Therefore, [2y] ≤ 2y < [2y] + 1.
  Therefore, we can rewrite L(x,y) and R(x,y) as follows:
  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ x + y + 2 < [x] + [y] + [x + y] + 3
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2x + 2y < [2x] + [2y] + 2
  From the above inequalities, we can see that L(x,y) can never be equal to R(x,y) because the difference between the upper bounds of the two expressions is always at least 1. Therefore, the answer is A: L(x,y) = R(x,y).

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Similarly, [y] and [x+y] represent the greatest integer less than or equal to y and x+y, respectively.
  Therefore, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] represents the sum of the three greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x+y.
  For R(x,y), [2x] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x. Similarly, [2y] represents the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Therefore, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] represents the sum of the two greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y.
  Let's try to compare L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  Since [x] ≤ x, [y] ≤ y, and [x+y] ≤ x+y, we have L(x,y) ≤ x+y+[x+y] = 2x+2y.
  Since [2x] ≤ 2x and [2y] ≤ 2y, we have R(x,y) ≤ 2x+2y.
  Therefore, we have L(x,y) ≤ 2x+2y and R(x,y) ≤ 2x+2y.
  If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we must have [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Let's consider the case where x and y are positive integers.
  Then, [x] = x, [y] = y, and [x+y] = x+y.
  Also, [2x] = 2x - 1 and [2y] = 2y - 1.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x+y] = x + y + (x+y) = 2x + 2y.
  And, [2x] + [2y] = (2x - 1) + (2y - 1) = 2x + 2y - 2.
  Since x and y are positive integers, we have [2x] + [2y] < [x] + [y] + [x+y].

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 1.5x.
  The area of the four walls is (2x * 1.5x) * 2 = 6x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls to be papered is 6x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, so the cost per sq.m is 260/(50 * 2) = Rs.2.6.
  Therefore, (6x^2 - 15) * 2.6 = 260, which gives x^2 = 25.
  Hence, x = 5 and the height of the room is 2x = 10m.
  But, the height of the room cannot be 10m, as it is not a practical height for a room.
  Therefore, we need to check our calculations.
  If we assume that the height of the room is 2.5m and the semi-perimeter is 6.25m, then the length of the room is 3.75m.
  The area of the four walls is (2.5m * 3.75m) * 2 = 18.75 sq.m.

Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
The perimeter of the room is 10x.
Then, the width of the room is (Area of the walls) / (Height of the room * Perimeter of the room).
The cost of papering the walls is (Width of the room * Perimeter of the room * Cost per meter).
We can use these equations to solve for x and find the height of the room.

Calculation:
Let's first calculate the area of the walls.
Area of the walls = Height of the room * Semi-perimeter * 2 - Area of doors and windows
Area of the walls = 2x * 5x * 2 - 15
Area of the walls = 20x^2 - 15

Let's now calculate the width of the room.
Width of the room = Area of the walls / (Height of the room * Perimeter of the room)
Width of the room = (20x^2 - 15) / (2x * 5x)
Width of the room = (2x^2 - 3) / x

Let's now calculate the cost of papering the walls.
Cost of papering the walls = Width of the room * Perimeter of the room * Cost per meter
Cost of papering the walls = ((2x^2 - 3) / x) * 10x * 2
Cost of papering the walls = 40x^2 - 60

We know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
Therefore, 40x^2 - 60 = 260
40x^2 = 320
x^2 = 8
x = sqrt(8)
x = 2sqrt(2)

To make a profit of $626,400 per year, the total revenue from selling 5,040 units of the computer component every year must be at least $1,180,800 ($554,400 + $626,400)

Total revenue from selling 5,040 units of the computer component every year = 5,040 x selling price per unit

Therefore, we can find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit of at least $626,400 by solving the following inequality:

5,040 x selling price per unit ≥ $1,180,800

selling price per unit ≥ $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040

selling price per unit ≥ $234.13

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.13 rounded up to the nearest dollar, which is $235.

  Simplifying further, we get (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2/(a2 - 2ab + b2)
  Cross-multiplying, we get (a - b)(a2 - 2ab + b2) = (a + b)(a - b)2
  Simplifying, we get a3 - 3a2b + 3ab2 - b3 = a3 - 2a2b - 2ab2 + b3
  Cancelling the terms, we get 3ab2 = 2a2b + 2ab2

  Rearranging this equation, we get 10a - 9c + b = 110.

  M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to abc - cba + 396c = 990, which is equivalent to 100a - 99c = 9.9(40c + b - a).

  Let's assume that there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange all their incomes in increasing order, then the median income will be the (n+1)/2-th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 must be equal to the sum of the incomes above $3000.
  Let's assume that there are x members in the family who earn less than $3000, and y members who earn more than $3000.
  Then, we have the following equations:
    x + y = n

    x = 2y
  Substituting x = 2y in the first equation, we get:

    x + y + z = n
  Substituting x = 2y and n = 3y, we get:

  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes of the first (n+1)/2-1 members is equal to the sum of the incomes of the remaining (n+1)/2 members.
  Let x be the number of family members who earn less than $3000 per month.
  Then, the number of family members who earn more than $3000 per month is n-x.
  We can write an equation based on the total income of the family:
  x * a + (n-x) * b = 9000, where a is the income of family members who earn less than $3000 per month, and b is the income of family members who earn more than $3000 per month.

  (a+b)/2 = 3000
  We can solve the system of equations to find x and n.

  Substituting a = 3000-b from this equation into the first equation, we get:

  Let's assume that C's share of Rs.150,000 is k times the common ratio.
  Therefore, k*(40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12-x)) = 375000.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get k*(x-6) = 5.
  As k is an integer, the possible values of k are 1 and 5.
  If k = 1, then x-6 = 5, which implies x = 11.
  If k = 5, then x-6 = 1, which implies x = 7.
  Therefore, C joined the business after (x-2) months after B joined.
  If x = 11, then C joined after 9 months, which is not a choice.
  If x = 7, then C joined after 5 months.

  Let's assume C joined after x months.
  A invested for 12 months, B invested for (12-2)=10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  The ratio of their investment is (40,000*12):(60,000*10):(120,000*(12-x)) = 2:3:9-3x.
  The total ratio is 2+3+(9-3x) = 14-3x.
  C's share of the profit is (150,000/375,000)*375,000 = 150,000.
  The ratio of C's share to the total profit is (150,000/375,000) = 2/5.

  Let's assume the original square piece of cloth has a side length of x feet.
  After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the new rectangle has dimensions (x-4) by x.
  The area of the rectangle is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2)bh, where b is the base and h is the height.
  Since the two triangles are congruent, they have the same base and height.
  Let's call the base of each triangle y feet.
  Then, the height of each triangle is (2*70)/y = 140/y feet.
  The diagonal of the rectangle is the hypotenuse of the two triangles.
  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the diagonal of the rectangle:
  diagonal^2 = y^2 + (140/y)^2
  diagonal^2 = (y^4 + 19600) / y^2
  diagonal = sqrt((y^4 + 19600) / y^2)
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x feet.
  We need to find x such that the diagonal of the rectangle is equal to x*sqrt(2) feet.
  Setting the two expressions for the diagonal equal to each other:
  sqrt((y^4 + 19600) / y^2) = x*sqrt(2)
  y^4 + 19600 = 2x^2*y^2
  y^4 - 2x^2*y^2 + 19600 = 0
  This is a quadratic equation in y^2.
  Solving for y^2 using the quadratic formula:
  y^2 = [2x^2 ± sqrt((2x^2)^2 - 4*1*19600)] / 2
  y^2 = x^2 ± sqrt(x^4 - 19600)
  Since y^2 is positive, we take the positive square root:
  y^2 = x^2 + sqrt(x^4 - 19600)
  We know that the area of the rectangle is x^2 - 4x.
  Setting this equal to 2*70 = 140:
  x^2 - 4x = 140
  x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
  Solving for x using the quadratic formula:
  x = [4 ± sqrt(4^2 - 4*1*(-140))] / 2
  x = [4 ± sqrt(736)] / 2
  x = 2 ± 2*sqrt(46)
  Since x > 0, we take the positive solution:
  x = 2 + 2*sqrt(46)
  Now we can find y^2:
  y^2 = x^2 + sqrt(x^4 - 19600)
  y^2 = (2 + 2*sqrt(46))^2 + sqrt((2 + 2*sqrt(46))^4 - 19600)
  y^2 = 4 + 16*sqrt(46) + 184 + 4*sqrt(46) + 1846

  Therefore, b * h = 140.
  We also know that b^2 + h^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2.
  Since the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half, the two triangles are congruent.

  b^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  We can solve for b and h in terms of x using the first equation:

  x^2 - 4x + 4 - 245/140^2 = 0

  x = (4 ± sqrt(16 + 9800/19600)) / 2
  x = (4 ± sqrt(16 + 0.5)) / 2
  x = (4 ± sqrt(16.5)) / 2

  The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the rectangle is L + 9.
  The area of the rectangle is (L + 9) * W.

  We need to find the area of the rectangular parking space.
  The area of a rectangle is length times width.
  The length is 9 feet and the width is x.
  Therefore, the area of the parking space is 9x.
  We can solve for x by substituting y = 28 - 2x into the equation.
  y + 2x = 28
  28 - 2x + 2x = 28
  28 = 28

To solve this problem, we need to use the concept of the remainder theorem. According to the remainder theorem, if a number 'a' is divided by 'N', then the remainder will be the same as when the sum of the digits of 'a' is divided by 'N'. 
Let's assume that the 3-digit number is 'abc'. 
Now, we can write:
  2272 = k1N + r
  875 = k2N + r
where k1 and k2 are quotients, and r is the remainder. 
Subtracting the above two equations, we get:
  1397 = (k1 - k2)N
Since N is a 3-digit number, it can be written as N = 100a + 10b + c. 
Therefore, we can write:
  1397 = (k1 - k2)(100a + 10b + c)
  1397 = 100(k1 - k2)a + 10(k1 - k2)b + (k1 - k2)c
Since 1397 is not divisible by 10, we can conclude that k1 - k2 is not equal to 0. 
Therefore, we can say that (k1 - k2) is a factor of 1397. 
The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397. 
So, we have two cases:
Case 1: k1 - k2 = 1
In this case, we can say that:
  1397 = 100a + 10b + c + N
  1397 = 101a + 11b + 2c
  1397 = 11(127 + b) + 2c
Since the remainder is less than N, we can say that the remainder is less than 100. 
Therefore, we can say that c is less than 50. 
Now, we can substitute the values of c from 0 to 49 and check which value of b satisfies the above equation. 
After checking all the values, we get that b = 9 and c = 8. 
Therefore, N = 198. 
The sum of the digits of N is 1 + 9 + 8 = 18.
Case 2: k1 - k2 = 1397
In this case, we can say that:
  1397 = 100a + 10b + c + 1397N
  1397(1 - N) = 100a + 10b + c
Since the remainder is less than N, we can say that the remainder is less than 100. 
Therefore, we can say that c is less than 100. 
Now, we can substitute the values of c from 0 to 99 and check which values of a and b satisfy the above equation. 
After checking all the values, we do not get any value of a, b, and c that satisfies the above equation. 
Therefore, this case is not possible. 
So, the sum of the digits of N is 18.

Let's find the difference between 2272 and 875.
2272 - 875 = 1397
Let's assume that the 3-digit number N divides 1397 with a remainder R.
So, 1397 = kN + R, where k is a positive integer and R is the remainder.
Now, let's divide 2272 and 875 by N.
2272 = aN + R
875 = bN + R
where a and b are positive integers.
Subtracting the above two equations, we get:
1397 = (a-b)N
So, N divides 1397.
The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397.
The 3-digit factors of 1397 are not possible.
So, N is a 4-digit number.
Let's find the sum of the digits of N.
The remainder R is less than N.
The maximum value of R is N-1.
So, the maximum value of the difference between 2272 and 875 is N-1.
N-1 = 1397 - R - 1
N = 1397 - R
The sum of the digits of N is the sum of the digits of 1397-R.
1397 = 1+3+9+7 = 20

  Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.
  On a particular day, Jack finishes 2/3 of the work.
  Therefore, the remaining 1/3 of the work is left for Jill to complete.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to complete the remaining 1/3 of the work.
  Jack's rate of cleaning is 1 yacht per 12 hours, which is 1/12 of a yacht per hour.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of a yacht per hour.
  Using the formula: Rate = Work / Time, we can set up the equation:

  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining one-third of the work.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work, so he took one-third of the time, which is 12/3 = 4 hours.
  Let's calculate the rate of Jack and Jill.
  Jack's rate is 1 yacht/12 hours = 1/12 yacht per hour.
  Jill's rate is 5% of Jack's rate, which is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 yacht per hour.
  Let's calculate the remaining work.
  The remaining work is one-third of the total work, which is (1/3) * 1 yacht = 1/3 yacht.
  Let's use the work formula: Work = Rate * Time.
  The work done by Jack is (2/3) * 1 yacht = 2/3 yacht.
  The work done by Jill is (1/3) * 1 yacht = 1/3 yacht.

  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which is equivalent to finding the minimum value of x.
  We can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by 5:
  4x + 5y = 68
  We know that x and y are both integers, so we can try different values of x starting from 1 and see if we can find a solution for y that makes the equation true.
  If x = 1, then 4 + 5y = 68, which gives y = 64/5, which is not an integer.
  If x = 2, then 8 + 5y = 68, which gives y = 12, which is an integer.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 2.
  The answer is C: 2.

  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  According to the problem, for each copper coin, she gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin, she gets 25 cents.
  Therefore, the total amount of money she gets can be expressed as 20x + 25y cents.
  From the problem, we know that she got $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  So, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize x.
  Let's try to solve for x in terms of y.
  20x + 25y = 340
  4x + 5y = 68
  4x = 68 - 5y
  x = (68 - 5y)/4
  Since x has to be a positive integer, we can try different values of y to see which one gives us a positive integer value for x.
  If y = 0, then x = 17, which is a positive integer.
  If y = 1, then x = 16.25, which is not a positive integer.
  If y = 2, then x = 15.5, which is not a positive integer.
  If y = 3, then x = 14.75, which is not a positive integer.
  If y = 4, then x = 14, which is a positive integer.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 14.

  Then, a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Also, 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495, which implies a - c = 5.
  Now, we can use the first two equations to solve for a, b, and c.

  We know that a, b, and c are digits, so they must be integers between 0 and 9 inclusive.
  We can use Equation 1 to narrow down the possibilities for c:

      4b + 40 = 0
      b = -10
    This is not a valid digit, so c cannot be 2.

      b = -21/4
    This is not a valid digit, so c cannot be 3.

  From the first condition, we know that a + b + c = 17.
  From the second condition, we know that a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  We can use the first condition to express one of the variables in terms of the other two.
  For example, we can write a = 17 - b - c.
  Substituting this expression for a into the second condition, we get:
  (17 - b - c)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Expanding and simplifying this equation, we get:
  2b^2 + 2c^2 + 2bc - 34b - 34c + 90 = 0.
  We can use this equation to express one of the variables in terms of the other.
  For example, we can solve for b and get:
  b = (17 ± sqrt(221 - 3c^2)) / 3.
  Since b is an integer, 221 - 3c^2 must be a perfect square.
  The only possible values of c that make this true are 1, 4, and 7.

  We also know that |W - (V ∩ W)| = 2.5|V ∩ W| (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm).
  Finally, we know that |V^c| = 0.5(250) (50% of the files were not infected by a virus).

  From the last equation, we get |V^c| = 125.
  From the first equation, we get |V ∩ W| = |V| + |W| - |V ∪ W| = |V| + |W| - 250.

  Distance travelled by Bob in ""t"" hours = 78t km
  Distance travelled by Allen from Y to X = 54(t/2) km
  Distance travelled by Bob from X to Y = 78(t/2) km
  Total distance travelled by Bob = 78t + 78(t/2) km = 117t km

  Let's find out how many days it takes for the number of water lilies to double from 64 to fully cover the lake.
  64 * 2 = 128. It takes 2 days to double from 64 to 128.
  128 * 2 = 256. It takes 2 more days to double from 128 to 256.

  Let's assume that the distance between City A and City B is ""d"".
  Train M travels at a constant speed and covers ""d"" distance in 4 hours.
  Therefore, the speed of Train M is ""d/4"".

  The total distance traveled by both trains is ""2d"".
  The time taken for the two trains to meet is the same.
  Let's assume that the time taken for the two trains to meet is ""t"".
  We can use the formula: distance = speed x time.

  Train M travels for 4 hours from City A to City B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours from City B to City A.
  The total distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours from 5 am when Train M leaves City A.
  Then, Train M would have traveled for x hours, and Train N would have traveled for (x - 2) hours.
  The distance traveled by Train M = speed of Train M * time traveled by Train M
  The distance traveled by Train N = speed of Train N * time traveled by Train N
  The sum of the distances traveled by Train M and Train N is equal to the total distance between City A and City B.
  We can use this information to find the value of x, which is the time when the two trains cross each other.
  Therefore, we can solve for x using the following equation:
  speed of Train M * x + speed of Train N * (x - 2) = total distance
  We know that the speed of Train M is greater than the speed of Train N because Train M has to cover a greater distance in a shorter time.
  Therefore, the value of x should be closer to 7 am when Train N leaves City B.
  Let's solve for x:
  speed of Train M = distance / time = total distance / 4
  speed of Train N = distance / time = total distance / 3.5
  total distance = speed of Train M * x + speed of Train N * (x - 2)
  total distance = (total distance / 4) * x + (total distance / 3.5) * (x - 2)
  total distance = (7 * total distance / 28) * x + (10 * total distance / 35) * (x - 2)
  total distance = (5/28) * x + (2/7) * (x - 2)
  total distance = (5/28) * x + (2/7) * x - (4/7)
  total distance = (29/28) * x - (4/7)
  (29/28) * x = total distance + (4/7)
  x = (28/29) * (total distance + (4/7))
  Now, we can substitute the value of total distance, which is the distance between City A and City B, into the equation and solve for x.
  The distance between City A and City B is not given in the question, so we cannot solve for x.

Let's assume that the initial quantity of sand in the mixture is S and the initial quantity of clay in the mixture is C. We know that the total quantity of the mixture is 10 kg. Therefore:

S + C = 10  (Equation 1)

We also know that the initial mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay. Therefore:

S/C = 3/7  (Equation 2)

We want to remove and replace some of the mixture in order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. Let's assume that we need to remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand. After this operation, the quantity of sand in the mixture will be S+x and the quantity of clay will be C-x. We want these quantities to be equal. Therefore:

S+x = C-x

2x = C-S

2x = 7C/3 - 7S/3   (using Equation 2)

x = 7/6(C-S)

We also know that the total quantity of the mixture after the operation is still 10 kg. Therefore:

S+x + C-x = 10

Solving for S and C using Equation 1, we get:

S = 10 - C

Substituting this into the above equation, we get:

x = 7/6(C-10+C)

x = 7/6(2C-10)

x = 7/3(C-5)

Substituting Equation 2 into the above equation, we get:

x = 7/3(7S/3 - 5)

x = 35/9 - 7S/9

Therefore, we need to remove approximately 35/9 - 7S/9 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand in order to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

To find the value of S, we can use Equation 2:

S/C = 3/7

S = 3C/7

Substituting this into the above equation, we get:

x = 35/9 - 7(3C/7)/9

x = 35/9 - 3C/9

x = (35-3C)/9

We want x to be a positive number, so:

35-3C > 0

C < 35/3

Therefore, C can be any value less than 35/3. Let's try C = 3:

S = 3C/7 = 9/7

- The current mixture contains 30% sand and 70% clay.
- We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, which means 50% sand and 50% clay.
- We need to remove some of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
- Let's assume we remove x kg of the mixture.
- The amount of sand in the remaining mixture is 0.3 * (10 - x) kg.
- We want to add x kg of pure sand to the remaining mixture.
- The total amount of sand in the new mixture will be 0.5 * (10 kg).
- We can set up an equation to solve for x:
  - 0.3 * (10 - x) + x = 0.5 * 10
  - Simplifying the equation, we get:
    - 3 - 0.3x + x = 5
    - 0.7x = 2

  We do not know the value of W, but we can see that the cost of gardening will be a linear function of W.
  The cost of gardening will be minimum when d/dW (20W+3000) = 0.
  Therefore, 20 = 0, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening will be minimum at the endpoints of the feasible region, which are W = 0 and W = 170.

  From the first statement, we know that J + S + F = 100.
  From the second statement, we know that when J = F, S + (J-F) = 2S, which simplifies to J = S.
  From the third statement, we know that when J = F, F = 2(S - F).
  We can use the first and third statements to form two equations with two variables (J and F):
    J + S + F = 100
    F = 2(S - F)
    Simplifying the second equation, we get:
    F = 2S - 2F
    3F = 2S
    S = (3/2)F
  We can substitute S = J into the second equation to get:

  Now we can substitute J and S in terms of F into the first equation:
    J + S + F = 100
    F/2 + (3/2)F + F = 100
    3F = 100*2/2

From the first statement:

From the second statement:
  When J = F, S + (F - S) * 2
  2S = 3F - S

From the third statement:
  When J = F, F = 2 * (S - (F - S))
  3F = 2S + 4F - 4S
  F = 2S

Substituting F = 2S in J + S + F = 100:

  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume x is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father.
  So, J + x = F + x
  S + x = 2S
  Therefore, S = x
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume y is the number of years until Joe is as old as his father when his sister was as old as her father.
  So, F + x = 2(y + S)
  We can substitute S = x in the above equation.
  F + x = 2(x + y)
  F = x + 2y
  We can substitute S = x in the equation J + S + F = 100.
  J + x + x + 2y = 100
  J + 2x + 2y = 100
  J = 100 - 2x - 2y
  We have three equations:
  J + 2x + 2y = 100
  S = x
  F = x + 2y
  We need to find F.

  F = x + 2(50 - x/2 - y)
  F = x + 100 - x - 2y
  F = 100 - y
  We can substitute F = 100 - y in the equation J + 2x + 2y = 100.
  J + 2x + 2(100 - F) = 100
  J + 2x + 200 - 2F = 100
  J + 2x - 2F = -100
  We can substitute J = 100 - 2x - 2y and F = 100 - y in the above equation.
  100 - 2x - 2y + 2x - 2(100 - y) = -100
  -2y + 2y = -100 - 100 + 100
  0 = -100

  Let's assume Joe's age is ""j"", Joe's sister's age is ""s"", and Joe's father's age is ""f"".
  From the first statement, we know that j + s + f = 100.
  From the second statement, we know that when j = f, s + (f - s) * 2 = 2s, which simplifies to f = 3s.
  From the third statement, we know that when j = f, f = 2 * (s - (f - s)), which simplifies to f = 3s.

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. This means that J + F = 2 * (S).
  When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. This means that F - J = 2 * (F - S).
  We have two equations with two variables. We can solve them simultaneously to find the values of F.
  From the first equation, we can write S = 100 - J - F.
  Substituting this value of S in the second equation, we get J + F = 2 * (100 - J - F).
  Simplifying this equation, we get 3 * F - 2 * J = 200.
  From the third equation, we can write F - 2 * S = J.
  Substituting the value of S from the first equation, we get F - 2 * (100 - J - F) = J.
  Simplifying this equation, we get F - 200 + 2 * J = J.
  Simplifying further, we get F = 100 + J.
  Substituting this value of F in the first equation, we get J + S + (100 + J) = 100.

  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he had already traveled a distance of d-70 miles (from B to a point 70 miles away from B) and had 3 more hours to travel the remaining distance (70 miles) to reach B.
  Using the formula: distance = speed x time, we can write an equation as follows:
  d-70 = 90 x (d/90 - 3)
  Solving for d, we get:
  d = 270
  Therefore, the distance between A and B is 270 miles.

  Let's call the distance between A and B ""d"".
  Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so it took him d/70 hours.
  Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
  The total time for the round trip is (d/70) + (d/90) = (9d + 7d)/(630) = (16d)/(630) = (8d)/(315) hours.
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he had already traveled (d - 70) miles, and had (d/315)*3 hours left to travel the remaining 70 miles.
  We can set up an equation to solve for d:
  (d - 70) + (d/315)*3*90 = d
  Solving for d, we get d = 270.

  10a + b + 10c - d + 9a - 9d + e - 5 = 0
  19a - 8d + b + 10c + e - 5 = 0
  Since ""a"", ""b"", ""c"", ""d"", and ""e"" are digits, we can try different values for ""a"" and ""d"" to find the solution.
  Let's try ""a"" = 4 and ""d"" = 2.
  19(4) - 8(2) + b + 10c + e - 5 = 0
  76 - 16 + b + 10c + e - 5 = 0

  Since a, b, c, d, and e are digits, we know that 0 <= a, b, c, d, e <= 9.
  We can start by testing values of a from 1 to 9.
  If a = 1, then 70000 = 9700b + 700c + 70d + 7e + 1
  We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by 7:
  10000 = 1390b + 100c + 10d + e + 1/7
  Since b, c, d, and e are digits, we know that 0 <= b, c, d, e <= 9.
  Therefore, the only possible value for b is 7 (because 1390 * 7 = 9730).
  If b = 7, then 10000 = 9730 + 100c + 10d + e + 1/7
  We can simplify this equation by subtracting 9730 from both sides:
  270 = 100c + 10d + e + 1/7
  Since c, d, and e are digits, we know that 0 <= c, d, e <= 9.
  Therefore, the only possible value for c is 2 (because 100 * 2 = 200).
  If c = 2, then 270 = 200 + 10d + e + 1/7
  We can simplify this equation by subtracting 200 from both sides:
  70 = 10d + e + 1/7
  Since d and e are digits, we know that 0 <= d, e <= 9.
  Therefore, the only possible value for d is 4 (because 10 * 4 = 40).
  If d = 4, then 70 = 40 + e + 1/7
  We can simplify this equation by subtracting 40 from both sides:
  30 = e + 1/7
  Since e is a digit, we know that 0 <= e <= 9.

Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount of money.
Then each daughter will receive 4x amount of money.
And each son will receive 5x amount of money.
So, the total amount of money given to nephews = 2x
The total amount of money given to daughters = 4 x 2 x = 8x
The total amount of money given to sons = 5 x 2x = 10x
The total amount of money given to all the children = 8x + 10x + 8600 = 18x + 8600
We know that the total number of children is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
So, we can write the equation as:
18x + 8600 = 11y, where y is the amount of money each child receives.
To solve for y, we need to find the value of x.

18x/11 + 8600/11 = y
We know that x is a multiple of 100, so let's assume x = 100.

  The cost of each additional quarter-mile is $0.10.
  So, the total cost of the trip is $3.50 + $0.10(4x - 4) = $3.50 + $0.40x - $0.40 = $0.40x + $3.10.

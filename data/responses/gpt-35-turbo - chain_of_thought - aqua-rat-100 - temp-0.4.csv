  The diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The diagonal of the rectangular solid can be found using the Pythagorean theorem.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs a and b and hypotenuse c, c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
  To find the diagonal of the rectangular solid, we need to find the hypotenuse of the right triangles formed by its three pairs of sides.
  The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the sides of length 3 and 4 is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2) = 5.
  The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the sides of length 3 and 15 is sqrt(3^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(234).
  The hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the sides of length 4 and 15 is sqrt(4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(241).
  Therefore, the diagonal of the rectangular solid is the square root of the sum of the squares of these three hypotenuses.

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many helpers are required to bake 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours. 

Let's start by finding out how many cakes each helper can bake in an hour. 

- One helper can make 2 large cakes in an hour
- One helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour

We need to convert the number of large cakes into small cakes to make the calculation easier.

- 20 large cakes = 20 x 35 = 700 small cakes

So we need to bake a total of 700 + 700 = 1400 small cakes. 

Now we can calculate how many helpers are required.

- One helper can make 35 small cakes in an hour
- We need to make 1400 small cakes
- Therefore, we need 1400/35 = 40 helpers to make 1400 small cakes in an hour

We have 3 hours to make the cakes, so we need to divide the total number of helpers by the number of hours.

- 40 helpers / 3 hours = 13.33 helpers

We can't have a fraction of a helper, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.

- Rounding up 13.33 to the nearest whole number gives us 14 helpers.

- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total time available is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.
- Let's assume we need x helpers to make the large cakes and y helpers to make the small cakes.
- The total number of large cakes needed is 20, and each helper can make 2 large cakes/hr, so the total number of hours required to make the large cakes is 20 / (2 * x) = 10 / x.
- The total number of small cakes needed is 700, and each helper can make 35 small cakes/hr, so the total number of hours required to make the small cakes is 700 / (35 * y) = 4 / y.
- The total time required to make both types of cakes should not exceed the total time available, so we have the following inequality: 10 / x + 4 / y <= 180.
- We also know that x and y should be positive integers.
- We can use trial and error to find the values of x and y that satisfy the inequality and give us the minimum value of x + y.

Calculations:
- We can start by assuming x = 10 and y = 1.
- Then, 10 / x + 4 / y = 10 / 10 + 4 / 1 = 5 + 4 = 9, which is less than 180.
- The sum of helpers is 10 + 1 = 11.
- We can try other combinations of x and y, but we will find that they all give us a sum of helpers greater than 11.

  To calculate the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel, we need to calculate the length of the train.
  Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time
  We know that the distance is 1 mile, and the speed is 120 miles per hour.
  We need to convert the speed to miles per second, so we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  speed = 120 miles/hour = 120/3600 miles/second = 1/30 miles/second
  Let's call the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel ""t"".
  The distance the train travels in time ""t"" is equal to the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel.
  distance = length of train + length of tunnel = x + 1
  We can now use the formula to solve for ""t"":
  distance = speed x time
  x + 1 = (1/30) x t
  x = (1/30) x t - 1
  We know that it takes 3 seconds for the train to enter the tunnel, so the total time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel is 3 + t.
  We can substitute the expression we found for ""x"" into this equation:
  total time = 3 + t = 3 + [(1/30) x t - 1] = (29/30) x t + 2
  Now we can solve for ""t"":

  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile long tunnel.
  The train's length is not given.
  We can use the speed of the train to determine how long it takes to pass through the tunnel.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to convert miles per hour to miles per second to match the units of the tunnel length.
  120 miles per hour = 120/3600 miles per second (since there are 3600 seconds in an hour)
  120/3600 = 1/30 miles per second
  The train will take the same amount of time to pass through the tunnel as it does to travel its own length at this speed.
  Let's call the length of the train ""x"".
  We know that x + 1 (the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel) is traveled at a rate of 1/30 miles per second.
  We can set up the equation (x + 1) / (1/30) = t, where t is the time it takes to pass through the tunnel.
  Solving for t, we get t = 30(x + 1).
  We need to find x to solve for t.
  We know that the train's length is given in miles, but we need it in feet to match the units of the tunnel length.
  1 mile = 5280 feet.
  Therefore, the train's length is 5280x feet.
  We can substitute this into our equation and solve for t.
  t = 30(5280x + 5280) = 158400x + 158400
  We need to find x to determine t.
  We can use the formula distance = rate x time to find x.
  The train travels its own length at a rate of 120 miles per hour.
  120 miles per hour = 120/3600 miles per second = 1/30 miles per second.
  Therefore, x = (length of train) / (rate of train) = (5280x) / (1/30) = 158400x
  We can substitute this into our equation for t to get t = 158400x + 158400.
  Now we can solve for t.
  t = 158400x + 158400 = 158400(1/120) + 158400 = 1320 seconds
  Therefore, it will take 1320 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.

  The middle letter must be a vowel, so there are 5 choices for that letter.
  The first and third letters must be different from each other and both consonants, so there are 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter.
  The order of the letters matters, so we should use the permutation formula.
  We have 5 choices for the middle letter, 20 choices for the first letter, and 19 choices for the third letter.
  Therefore, the number of different codes that can be made is P(5,1) * P(20,1) * P(19,1) = 5 * 20 * 19 = 1,900.

  To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color, we need to assume the worst-case scenario, which is that we pick one tie of each color before we get a duplicate.
  Therefore, we need to pick 5 ties (one of each color) first before we can get two of the same color.
  After picking 5 ties, the next tie we pick will be the 6th tie.

We know that the price of the product is reduced by 30%, which means a = 30.

Substituting the values in the formula, we get:

  We can express l in terms of w by rearranging the formula lw = 240 to get l = 240/w.
  Substituting this into the expression for the total length of fencing, we get:
  l + 2w - 10 = 240/w + 2w - 10.
  To find the value of w that minimizes the total length of fencing, we can differentiate this expression with respect to w and set the result equal to zero.
  After solving for w, we can substitute the value back into the expression for the total length of fencing to get the final answer.

  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced.
  The unfenced side is the width of the yard, which is W.
  The area of the yard is given as 240 square meters, so we can write the equation LW = 240.

  P = 2x + 2y + 10 = 2x + 2(240/x) + 10 = 2x^2 + 10x + 480/x + 10.
  We can now differentiate P with respect to x and set it equal to zero to find the value of x that minimizes P.
  dP/dx = 4x - 480/x^2 + 10 = 0.

- Let's assume that the store had x yellow golf balls and x white golf balls at the beginning of the day.
- At the end of the day, the store sold 80% of its inventory, which means it sold 0.8 * 2x = 1.6x golf balls.
- We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, which means it sold x white golf balls.
- Therefore, x white golf balls = 0.4 * 2x = 0.8x golf balls were left in stock at the end of the day.
- Since the store sold 1.6x golf balls, and x white golf balls were sold, the store sold x yellow golf balls.
- Therefore, the store had x + x = 2x = 600 - 0.8 * 2x, or 2.4x = 600 - 1.6x golf balls at the beginning of the day.

  Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, so the new total cost is (n+5)(0.85x) = nx + 5(0.85x) = nx + 4.25x.
  We know that nx + 4.25x = 300, so we can solve for x.
  nx + 4.25x = 300
  (n+4.25)x = 300
  x = 300 / (n+4.25)
  We don't know n, but we know that Anna is able to buy 5 more articles, so n+5 is the new number of articles that Anna can buy for $300.
  x = 300 / (n+4.25)
  x = 300 / (n+4.25+5)
  x = 300 / (n+9.25)
  The new selling price of each article is x * 0.85.

  Let's assume that the original price of each article is x.
  The price of each article decreased by 15%, which means the new price of each article is (100% - 15%) = 85% of the original price.
  Therefore, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
  Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, which means she can buy a total of (5 + 5) = 10 articles.
  The total cost of 10 articles at the new price is 10 * 0.85x = 8.5x.

  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then the original price of each article was $300/(number of articles she could buy before)

  Anna is able to buy 5 more articles, so the original number of articles she could buy was (x) and the new number of articles she can buy is (x+5).
  We know that the price of each article decreased by 15%, so the new price of each article is (0.85p).
  We can set up the equation:

The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which is $160 - 20%($160) = $128.
Therefore, the appliance was sold for $128 - $100 = $28 more than its wholesale cost.
The percent increase is $28/$100 x 100% = 28%.

  Let's assume the length of the sheet is L and the breadth is B.
  When folded along the length, the perimeter of each part is 48cm.
  Therefore, 2(L/2 + B) = 48.
  Simplifying the equation, we get L + B = 24.
  When folded along the breadth, the perimeter of each part is 66cm.
  Therefore, 2(L + B/2) = 66.
  Simplifying the equation, we get L + B = 33.
  We now have two equations and two variables. We can solve for L and B.
  Adding the two equations, we get 2L + 2B = 57.
  Dividing by 2, we get L + B = 28.5.
  Subtracting this equation from the equation L + B = 24, we get B = 4.5.
  Substituting the value of B in any of the equations, we get L = 24 - B = 19.5.
  Therefore, the area of the sheet is L*B = 19.5*4.5 = 87.75.
  Rounding off to the nearest integer, we get 88.

Let's assume that x is the number of friends who attended the picnic.
The total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96.
So, each person's share would be 96/x.
When 4 people didn't show up, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, the new share of each person became (96/x) + 4.
Therefore, the equation is (96/x) + 4(x-4) = 96.
Simplifying the equation, we get x^2 - 16x + 48 = 0.
Factoring the equation, we get (x-8)(x-6) = 0.

  We want to find out how much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other.
  Let t be the time in hours that has passed since the two cars started their commute.
  The distance between the two cars after t hours is (55 - 52) * t = 3t miles.
  We want to find t when the distance between the two cars is 15 miles.
  3t = 15
  t = 5
  Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other.
  The answer is B: 5 hours.

  Let's try to simplify L(x,y) and R(x,y) expressions.
  We know that [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example, [3.14] = 3, [2.99] = 2, and [4] = 4.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to x, y, and x+y.
  Similarly, [2x] + [2y] is the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to 2x and 2y.
  Let's consider the following cases:
  Case 1: x and y are both integers.
    In this case, [x] = x, [y] = y, [x+y] = x+y, [2x] = 2x, and [2y] = 2y.
    Therefore, L(x,y) = x + y + x + y = 2x + 2y = R(x,y).
  Case 2: x and y are not integers.
    In this case, [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, which means [x] ≤ x < [x] + 1.
    Similarly, [y] ≤ y < [y] + 1 and [x+y] ≤ x+y < [x+y] + 1.
    Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ x + y + (x+y) < [x] + [y] + [x+y] + 3.
    Also, [2x] ≤ 2x < [2x] + 1 and [2y] ≤ 2y < [2y] + 1.
    Therefore, [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2x + 2y < [2x] + [2y] + 2.
    Now, let's compare L(x,y) and R(x,y).
    If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we must have [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y].
    From the above inequalities, we have:
      2x + 2y - 3 < [2x] + [2y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ 2x + 2y.
    Therefore, we must have 2x + 2y - 3 < 2x + 2y, which is impossible for positive real numbers x and y.
    Hence, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).
    Therefore, the answer is A: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y).

  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x + y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x + y.
  Therefore, [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] since the greatest integer less than or equal to a sum of two numbers cannot be greater than the sum of the greatest integers less than or equal to each number.
  Then, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x] + [y] = 2[x] + 2[y].
  For R(x,y), [2x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Therefore, R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].
  If we can find any two positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we have found a counterexample to the inequality L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y) we derived earlier.
  Let's try to find such a counterexample.

  If he gave a discount of 7%, the selling price of the watch would be 0.93M.
  The difference between the selling prices is Rs. 15.
  Therefore, 0.95M - 0.93M = 15.
  Solving for M, we get M = 750.
  Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

Let's assume the marked price of the watch is 'x'.
After giving a 5% discount, the selling price of the watch is 0.95x.
After giving a 7% discount, the selling price of the watch is 0.93x.
We know that the profit earned by the shopkeeper is higher when a 5% discount is given.
Let's assume the profit earned by the shopkeeper after giving a 5% discount is 'y'.
Then, the profit earned by the shopkeeper after giving a 7% discount is 'y - 15'.
We can calculate the cost price of the watch as (100 * y) / 95.
We can set up an equation as follows:
y = x - (100 * y) / 95
y - (y - 15) = 0.02x
15 = 0.02x
x = 750
Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

  The company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month.
  The production cost to the company of each component is $110.
  Therefore, the total monthly production cost is $110 * 420 = $46,200.
  The company sells all of the components by the end of each month.
  Therefore, the monthly revenue from sales is equal to the monthly production cost, which is $46,200.
  The yearly revenue from sales is $46,200 * 12 = $554,400.
  The yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) needs to be at least $626,400.

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400, we need to calculate the total revenue and subtract the total production cost for the year. We can use the following formula to calculate the total revenue:
Total Revenue = Selling Price x Number of Units
We know that the company produces 420 units of the component every month. Therefore, the number of units produced in a year is:
Number of Units = 420 x 12 = 5,040
Let's assume the selling price per component is x. Therefore, the total revenue for the year will be:
Total Revenue = x x 5,040
The total production cost for the year will be:
Total Production Cost = 110 x 5,040
The yearly profit will be:
Yearly Profit = Total Revenue - Total Production Cost
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400. Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:
x x 5,040 - 110 x 5,040 >= 626,400
Simplifying the inequality, we get:
x >= (626,400 + 110 x 5,040) / 5,040
x >= 230.4
Rounding up to the nearest dollar, we get:
x >= 231
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $231.

  A started 3km south, then 3km north, so he is back where he started from in the north-south direction.
  A then traveled 5km east and 2km west, so he is 3km east of where he started from in the east-west direction.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance between A's starting point and ending point.

  The formula is given by (b-a)/gcd(a,b) + 1, where gcd(a,b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.
  In this case, gcd(11,33) = 11, so the formula reduces to (b-a)/11 + 1.

  When a = 3, we have b = 1, 4, 7 and c = 1, 4, 7.

  M = abc is a three-digit number, so a, b, and c are digits.
  N = cba is the number formed by reversing the digits of M.
  M > N, so a > c.
  M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified as 99(a-c) + 396c = 990.
  Dividing both sides by 9 gives 11(a-c) + 44c = 110.
  Simplifying further gives 11(a-3c) = 10.
  The only possible value of (a-3c) is 1.
  Therefore, a = 3c + 1.
  Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a > 0.
  This means that c > -1/3.
  The smallest integer value of c that satisfies this inequality is 1.
  Therefore, the smallest possible value of M is 401.
  We need to find how many values of M are more than 300.
  The number of values of M more than 300 is the same as the number of values of c that satisfy the inequality 1 ≤ c ≤ 3.

  M is a three-digit number, so 100 <= M <= 999.
  N is the reverse of M, so N = 100a + 10b + c.
  M - N = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c).
  Since M > N, a > c or a = c and b > c.
  If a > c, then M - N + 396c = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) + 396c = 99(a - c + 4c) - 9b = 99a - 5b.
  If a = c and b > c, then M - N + 396c = 99(a - c) - 9(b - c) + 396c = 99*0 - 9(b - c + 4c) = -9b + 27c.
  In either case, M - N + 396c is divisible by 9, so 99a - 5b is divisible by 9.
  Since 100 <= M <= 999, we can write M = 100a + 10b + c >= 300, which implies a >= 3.
  If a >= 4, then 99a - 5b >= 99*4 - 5*9 = 327, so M - N + 396c = 99a - 5b >= 327.
  If a = 3, then 99a - 5b >= 99*3 - 5*9 = 258, so M - N + 396c = 99a - 5b >= 258.
  Therefore, there are 400 - 258 = 142 values of M that satisfy the conditions.
  However, we need to exclude the values of M that are less than 300.
  If a = 1, then M = 100a + 10b + c < 300.
  If a = 2 and b <= c, then M = 100a + 10b + c < 300.
  If a = 2 and b > c, then M - N + 396c = -9b + 27c < 0, so M < N - 396c <= 297.

  M - N + 396c = 990.

  Total income = income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + $3000 + ... + income of the n-th member
  We also know that the total income is $9000, so we can substitute that value:
  $9000 = income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + $3000 + ... + income of the n-th member
  We can simplify this equation by subtracting $3000 from both sides:
  $6000 = income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member + income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member
  We know that at least half of the family members earn less than $3000, so the sum of their incomes is less than or equal to $3000 * (n+1)/2.
  We also know that at least half of the family members earn more than $3000, so the sum of their incomes is greater than or equal to $3000 * (n-1)/2.
  Therefore, we can write two inequalities:
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member <= $3000 * (n+1)/2
  income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member <= $3000 * (n+1)/2
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member + income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member >= $3000 * (n-1)/2
  We can simplify these inequalities by dividing both sides by (n-1)/2:
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member <= $1500 * n + $1500
  income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member <= $1500 * n - $1500
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member + income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member >= $1500 * n - $1500
  We can add the three inequalities to get:
  2 * (income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member + income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member) <= $4500 * n
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the (n-1)/2-th member + income of the (n+1)/2-th member + ... + income of the n-th member <= $2250 * n
  This inequality tells us that the sum of the incomes of the family members is less than or equal to $2250 times the number of family members.
  Since the total income of the family is $9000, we can also write:
  income of the 1st member + income of the 2nd member + ... + income of the n-th member = $9000
  We can use these two equations to find the maximum possible value of n:

  Rearranging and simplifying this equation, we get: k^2 - 101k + 2652 = 0.
  Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (k-28)(k-73) = 0.
  Therefore, k = 28 or k = 73.
  We are looking for the value of k, which is the number of consecutive integers, so we can eliminate k = 73 because it is too large.

  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers start from x.
  Then the sum of k consecutive integers can be expressed as kx.
  We know that the least integer is -50, so the first integer in the sequence is -50.
  Therefore, we can express the sum of k consecutive integers as k(-50 + (k-1)).
  We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51.
  So, we can set up the equation k(-50 + (k-1)) = 51 and solve for k.

  Let's use algebra to solve this problem.
  Let's assume that the first integer is x.
  Since the least integer is -50, then x = -50.
  The sum of k consecutive integers is 51, so we can write an equation:
  x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
  Substituting x = -50, we get:
  -50 + (-49) + (-48) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51
  Rearranging the terms, we get:
  -50k + (1+2+...+k) = 51
  -50k + k(k+1)/2 = 51
  Multiplying both sides by 2:
  -100k + k(k+1) = 102
  Rearranging the terms:
  k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0
  Solving for k using the quadratic formula, we get:

  Since we have the area of the triangle, we can solve for the base or height.
  Let's assume the base of the triangle is 'b' and the height is 'h'.
  Then, (1/2) * b * h = 70.
  Therefore, b * h = 140.
  We know that the two triangles are congruent, so they have the same base and height.

  We can use these two equations to solve for l and w, and then use those values to find the area of the rectangle.
  2l + w = 37, so w = 37 - 2l.

  To maximize the area, we can take the derivative of this expression with respect to l, set it equal to 0, and solve for l.
  The derivative of 28l - 2l^2 is 28 - 4l, so 28 - 4l = 0, which gives us l = 7.

  In the next 3 hours, both hoses together fill the remaining (6/x) of the pool.
  Let's assume that hose B fills 1/y of the pool in 1 hour.
  Both hoses together fill (6/x) of the pool in 3 hours, so they fill (2/x) of the pool in 1 hour.
  Therefore, (2/x) + (1/y) = 1.

  The remaining 3/4 of the pool was filled by both hoses working together in 3 hours.
  Let's use the formula: rate x time = work done.
  The work done by both hoses working together is 3/4 of the pool, so we can write the equation:

  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht per hour.
  Jack has already done two-thirds of the work, so he has left one-third of the work, which is (1/3) * 1 = 1/3 of the yacht.
  Jill has to clean 1/3 of the yacht, so the time she takes to complete the remaining work is given by the equation (1/240) * x * (1/3) = 1.
  Solving for x, we get x = 20.

  Since x has to be a whole number, we need to find a value of y that makes x a whole number.

  Let's assume the number of copper coins as 'c' and the number of brass coins as 'b'.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for 'c' copper coins is 20c cents.
  Similarly, the amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for 'b' brass coins is 25b cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  So, we can write an equation: 20c + 25b = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which means we need to minimize the value of 'c'.
  Let's try to solve for 'c':
  20c + 25b = 340
  4c + 5b = 68
  We know that 'c' and 'b' are integers, and we need to minimize the value of 'c'. 
  If we assume 'b' as an even number, then 'c' will be an odd number to satisfy the equation.
  If we assume 'b' as 2, then 'c' will be 17, which satisfies the equation.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 17.

  Let's assume that the number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is ""c"" and the number of brass coins is ""b"".
  From the given information, we know that the coin-diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin.
  Therefore, the total amount of money that the coin-diver got from the dive can be expressed as:
  20c + 25b = 340 cents
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, so we need to minimize the value of ""c"".
  We can start by assuming that all the coins that the coin-diver brought were brass coins, i.e., c = 0.
  In this case, the total amount of money that the coin-diver got would be:
  20c + 25b = 25b
  Since the total amount of money that the coin-diver got is $3.40, we can express this as:
  25b = 340 cents
  b = 13.6
  This is not possible, since the number of brass coins must be a whole number.
  Therefore, we need to try another value of ""c"".
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought only one copper coin, i.e., c = 1.
  In this case, the total amount of money that the coin-diver got would be:
  20c + 25b = 20 + 25b
  Since the total amount of money that the coin-diver got is $3.40, we can express this as:
  20 + 25b = 340 cents
  25b = 320 cents
  b = 12.8
  This is not possible, since the number of brass coins must be a whole number.
  Let's try another value of ""c"".
  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought two copper coins, i.e., c = 2.
  In this case, the total amount of money that the coin-diver got would be:
  20c + 25b = 40 + 25b
  Since the total amount of money that the coin-diver got is $3.40, we can express this as:
  40 + 25b = 340 cents
  25b = 300 cents
  b = 12

  Let's assume the number of copper coins is ""C"" and the number of brass coins is ""B"".
  From the problem, we know that:
    - The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents.
    - The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents.
    - She got $3.40 after one dive.
  We can write two equations based on the information above:
    - 0.20C + 0.25B = 3.40 (the total amount of money she got)
    - C + B = the total number of coins she got
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of C.
  We can use substitution to solve for C:
    - B = (3.40 - 0.20C) / 0.25
    - C + (3.40 - 0.20C) / 0.25 = the total number of coins she got
    - C + 13.6 - 0.8C = the total number of coins she got
    - 0.2C = the total number of coins she got - 13.6
    - C = (the total number of coins she got - 13.6) / 0.2
  We know that the number of coins she got must be a whole number, so we can try different values for the total number of coins until we find a whole number for C.
  Let's start with the smallest possible value for the total number of coins, which is 1 (since she got at least one coin):
    - C = (1 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -68
    - This is not a valid solution, since C cannot be negative.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 2:
    - C = (2 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -57
    - This is also not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 3:
    - C = (3 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -46
    - This is still not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 4:
    - C = (4 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -35
    - This is still not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 5:
    - C = (5 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -24
    - This is still not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 6:
    - C = (6 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -13
    - This is still not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 7:
    - C = (7 - 13.6) / 0.2 = -2
    - This is still not a valid solution.
  Let's try the next value for the total number of coins, which is 8:
    - C = (8 - 13.6) / 0.2 = 3

  We can use these equations to solve for A, B, and C.
  From A + B + C = 17, we know that C = 17 - A - B.
  Substituting this into A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109, we get A^2 + B^2 + (17 - A - B)^2 = 109.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 2A^2 + 2B^2 + 2AB - 34A - 34B + 210 = 0.
  We can rewrite this equation as (A - 7)^2 + (B - 4)^2 = 0.
  Since (A - 7)^2 and (B - 4)^2 are both non-negative, they must both be equal to 0.

  The cost price cannot be negative.
  So, the above calculation is wrong.
  Let's try another approach.
  Profit percent = 20%
  Selling price = Rs.360
  Cost price = (Selling price * 100) / (100 + Profit percent)
  Cost price = (360 * 100) / (100 + 20)
  Cost price = 300

- The hotel buys twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each of the other six days of the week, so it buys a total of 2*6 = 12 times as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on any other day of the week.
- Therefore, the hotel buys 12x newspapers on Sunday and (12*1=) 12 newspapers on each of the other six days of the week.
- The cost of buying x newspapers on Sunday is 4x dollars.
- The cost of buying 12 newspapers on each of the other six days of the week is 12*6*1 = 72 dollars.
- The total cost of buying all the newspapers is 4x + 72 dollars.
- We know that the hotel pays $210 per week for newspapers, so we can set up the equation:
    4x + 72 = 210
- Solving for x, we get:
    4x = 138

- Since the hotel can't buy half a newspaper, we know that it buys either 34 or 35 newspapers on Sunday.
- We also know that the hotel buys 12 newspapers on Monday.
- We need to find out how many newspapers the hotel buys on Monday, so we can subtract the number of newspapers bought on Sunday and the number bought on Monday from the total number of newspapers bought in a week:
    34 or 35 (Sunday) + 12 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 12 (Thursday) + 12 (Friday) + 12 (Saturday) = 210
    124 or 125 = 210 - 12 - 12 - 12 - 12 - 12 - 12
    124 or 125 = 126
- We can see that neither 124 nor 125 is a possible answer, so we made an error somewhere in our calculations.
- We know that the hotel must buy more newspapers on Monday than on any other day of the week, since Sunday is the day when the hotel buys the most newspapers.

  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 14/3 hours = 4 hours and 40 minutes
  Therefore, the two trains cross each other 4 hours and 40 minutes after Train N leaves City B.
  To find the exact time, we add 4 hours and 40 minutes to the time Train N left City B, which is 7 am.
  4 hours and 40 minutes = 4 * 60 + 40 = 280 minutes
  Adding 280 minutes to 7 am, we get:

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours after Train N has left City B.
  Therefore, Train M has traveled for (x + 2) hours when it meets Train N.
  The distance traveled by both trains is the same.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Therefore, the distance traveled by Train M is S1 * (x + 2) and the distance traveled by Train N is S2 * x.
  As both trains meet each other, the sum of the distances traveled by both the trains is equal to the distance between City A and City B.
  Distance between City A and City B = S1 * (x + 2) + S2 * x
  We know that Train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9 am, which means it takes 4 hours for Train M to travel between City A and City B.
  Therefore, S1 * 4 = Distance between City A and City B
  Similarly, Train N leaves City B at 7 am and reaches City A at 10:30 am, which means it takes 3.5 hours for Train N to travel between City B and City A.
  Therefore, S2 * 3.5 = Distance between City A and City B
  Equating both the distances, we get:
  S1 * 4 = S1 * (x + 2) + S2 * x
  Solving for x, we get x = 8/3 hours or 2 hours and 40 minutes.
  Therefore, the two trains meet after 2 hours and 40 minutes after Train N has left City B, which means they meet at 9:40 am.
  The time at which the two trains cross each other is 9:40 am - 2 hours = 7:40 am.

  Train M travels for 4 hours before it reaches City B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours before it reaches City A.
  The time difference between when Train M and Train N start their journey is 2 hours.
  The distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains.
  The time it takes for the trains to cross each other is the time it takes for them to cover the distance between City A and City B.
  Let's calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other.
  Let D be the distance between City A and City B.
  Let S_m be the speed of Train M.
  Let S_n be the speed of Train N.
  The time it takes for Train M to cover the distance D is D/S_m.
  The time it takes for Train N to cover the distance D is D/S_n.
  The time difference between when Train M and Train N start their journey is 2 hours.
  Therefore, the time it takes for the trains to cross each other is D/(S_m + S_n).
  We need to find D/(S_m + S_n) in hours and minutes.
  We can convert the time in decimal hours to hours and minutes by multiplying the decimal part by 60.
  Let's calculate D/(S_m + S_n) in decimal hours.
  We know that the distance between City A and City B is  D = S_m * 4 = S_n * 3.5.
  Therefore, S_m = D/4 and S_n = D/3.5.
  Substituting S_m and S_n in D/(S_m + S_n) we get D/((D/4) + (D/3.5)) = 14D/11.
  Therefore, the time it takes for the trains to cross each other is 14D/11 hours.
  Let's convert 14D/11 to hours and minutes.
  14D/11 = 1 + 3/11 hours = 1 hour and 16 minutes.

  Let's assume that the two trains cross each other x hours after Train N leaves City B.
  Train M has been traveling for x+2 hours when the two trains cross each other.
  The distance traveled by Train M is equal to the distance traveled by Train N.
  The distance traveled by Train M is equal to the speed of Train M multiplied by the time it has traveled.
  The distance traveled by Train N is equal to the speed of Train N multiplied by the time it has traveled.
  We can set up an equation to solve for x:

  Therefore, Train M travels for (x + 2) hours (from 5 am to x hours after Train N departs City B).
  The total distance covered by Train M and Train N before they meet is equal to the distance between City A and City B.
  The distance between City A and City B is the same for both trains.
  Therefore, the sum of the distances covered by the 2 trains is equal to the distance between City A and City B.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S_m and the speed of Train N is S_n.
  Then, the distance between City A and City B is equal to S_m * (x + 2) and also equal to S_n * 3.5.

  The total time between 5am and when the two trains meet is 4 + 3.5 = 7.5 hours.
  The two trains are moving towards each other.
  Therefore, the distance between them is decreasing at a combined rate of their speeds.
  Let's call the time it takes for the two trains to meet t.
  Then, the distance Train M travels in t hours is d = r*t, where r is the speed of Train M.
  Similarly, the distance Train N travels in t hours is d = r*t, where r is the speed of Train N.
  The total distance between the two trains is the sum of the distances they travel before meeting.
  Therefore, d = 4r + 3.5r = 7.5r.
  When the two trains meet, they have covered the entire distance between City A and City B.
  Therefore, 7.5r = distance between City A and City B.
  We know that the distance between City A and City B is 140 km.
  Therefore, 7.5r = 140.
  Solving for r, we get r = 18.67 km/h.
  We can now use this value of r to find t.
  The distance Train M travels before meeting Train N is d = r*(t-2).
  The distance Train N travels before meeting Train M is d = r*(t-0.5).
  Adding these two distances, we get 140 km.

- The amount of clay in the new mixture will be 0.7 * (10 - x) kg.
- We want the amount of sand and clay to be equal, so we can set up the equation:

- To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to have 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay.
- Let's assume we need to remove x kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
- The amount of sand in the new mixture will be 3 - (0.3x) + x, and the amount of clay will be 7 - (0.7x).
- We want the new mixture to have 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay, so we can set up the following equation:

    x = 4/3
- Therefore, we need to remove 4/3 kg of the mixture and replace it with pure sand.
- To check, the new mixture will have 5 kg of sand and 5 kg of clay:
    Sand = 3 - (0.3 * 4/3) + 4/3 = 5

Let's assume that the weight of the mixture is 10 kg.

And, clay in the mixture = 70% of 10kg = 7kg
To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, we need to add 3kg of sand to the mixture.
So, the total weight of the mixture will become 10 + 3 = 13 kg.
Now, let's assume that x kg of the mixture is to be removed and replaced with pure sand.
So, the amount of sand in the new mixture will be (3 + x) kg and the amount of clay will be (7 - x) kg.
As per the question, we need to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand.

- The mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay, which means that 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay are in the mixture.
- We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand. Since the original mixture has 3 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay, we need to add 4 kg of sand to make it 7 kg of sand and 7 kg of clay.
- To add 4 kg of sand, we need to remove some of the mixture. Let's say we remove x kg of the mixture.
- The amount of clay in the removed mixture is 0.7x kg, and the amount of sand in the removed mixture is 0.3x kg.
- We want the amount of sand and clay in the new mixture to be equal, so we need to add 4 - 0.3x kg of sand to the removed mixture.
- The amount of sand in the new mixture is 3 + 4 - 0.3x = 7 - 0.3x kg.
- The amount of sand in the new mixture is also 0.5(10 - x) kg, since the new mixture is half sand and half clay.
- Setting the two expressions for the amount of sand equal, we get:
  7 - 0.3x = 0.5(10 - x)
  7 - 0.3x = 5 - 0.5x
  0.2x = 2
  x = 10
- Therefore, we need to remove 10 kg of the mixture and replace it with 4 kg of sand.
- The amount of mixture to be removed and replaced with pure sand is 10 kg.

  The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of all its sides.
  If we have the perimeter of a rectangle, we can find the length and width of the rectangle.
  The length and width of the rectangle will be used to find the area of the rectangle.
  We can then use the area to find the cost of gardening the boundary.
  Let's solve the problem step-by-step.

Calculation:
  Let's assume that the length of the rectangle is L and the width is W.
  The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 340 meters.
  Therefore, 2(L + W) = 340
  L + W = 170
  We are given that we need to garden a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangle.
  Therefore, the length and width of the rectangle will be reduced by 2 meters (1 meter on each side).
  The new length and width of the rectangle will be L - 2 and W - 2, respectively.
  The area of the rectangle will be (L - 2) * (W - 2).
  The cost of gardening the boundary is given as 10 per square meter.
  Therefore, the total cost will be 10 * (L - 2) * (W - 2).

  Let's substitute L + W = 170 into the equation for the area of the rectangle.
  Area = L * W
       = L * (170 - L)
       = 170L - L^2

  Now, we can substitute the value of the area into the equation for the cost of gardening the boundary.
  Cost = 10 * (L - 2) * (W - 2)
       = 10 * (L - 2) * ((170 - L) - 2)
       = 10 * (L - 2) * (168 - L)
       = 10 * (L^2 - 170L + 336L - 336)
       = 10 * (L^2 - 134L - 3360)

  To find the cost, we need to find the value of L.
  We can use the quadratic formula to find the value of L.
  L = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
  where a = 1, b = -170, and c = -3360

  L = (-(-170) ± sqrt((-170)^2 - 4(1)(-3360))) / 2(1)
    = (170 ± sqrt(28900)) / 2
    = (170 ± 170) / 2
    = 85 or -95

  We can ignore the negative value of L.
  Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 85 meters.
  The width of the rectangle is 170 - 85 = 85 meters.
  The cost of gardening the boundary is:
  Cost = 10 * (L^2 - 134L - 3360)
       = 10 * (85^2 - 134(85) - 3360)
       = 10 * (7225 - 11390 - 3360)
       = 10 * (-7925)
       = -79250

  The cost cannot be negative.

  Therefore, the cost of gardening the entire boundary will be the area of the boundary multiplied by 10.
  We can simplify the equation for the area of the boundary to 4x^2 + 170x.
  We can substitute the value of x from the equation L+W = 170, which is x = (170-L)/4.
  We can then substitute this value of x in the equation for the area of the boundary to get the area of the boundary in terms of L.

  The length of the rectangular plot is l = 170 - b.
  The breadth of the rectangular plot is b.
  The area of the rectangular plot is l x b = (170-b) x b = 170b - b^2.
  The cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is equal to the cost of gardening an area of (l+2) x (b+2) square meters.

  Therefore, 2(L+W) = 340 or L+W = 170.
  We need to find the area of the rectangular plot and then subtract the area of the plot without the boundary.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*W.
  The length of the plot with the boundary will be L+2 and the width will be W+2.
  Therefore, the area of the plot with the boundary will be (L+2)*(W+2).
  The area of the boundary will be the difference between the area of the plot with the boundary and the area of the plot without the boundary.
  Area of the boundary = (L+2)*(W+2) - L*W = 2L + 2W + 4.
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter is 10.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the boundary will be (2L + 2W + 4)*10.
  We know that L+W = 170, so we can substitute that into the equation for the cost of gardening the boundary.
  Cost of gardening the boundary = (2L + 2W + 4)*10 = (2(170 - W) + 2W + 4)*10 = (340 + 4)*10 = 3440.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre is 3440.

  Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  Therefore, L+B = 170 meters.
  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L*B.
  The area of the rectangular plot with a 1-meter broad boundary is (L+2)*(B+2).
  The area of the boundary is the difference between the two areas, which is (L+2)*(B+2) - L*B.
  The cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is the product of the area of the boundary and the rate per square meter, which is 10.
  Therefore, the cost is 10*((L+2)*(B+2) - L*B).
  We know that L+B = 170 meters, which means B = 170 - L.
  We can substitute this value in the equation for the cost to get the cost in terms of L.
  After simplification, we get the equation for the cost as 10*(2L + 172).
  We can now calculate the cost for any value of L.
  Therefore, the answer is not ""Cannot be determined"" or ""None of these"".

  Let's assume the rectangular plot has length L and breadth B.
  We are given that the perimeter of the plot is 340 meters, so 2(L+B) = 340.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get L+B = 170.
  We are also given that we need to garden a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The area of the rectangular plot is LB, and the area of the plot after gardening the boundary will be (L+2)(B+2).
  The area of the boundary will be (L+2)(B+2) - LB.
  The cost of gardening the boundary will be the area of the boundary multiplied by the rate of 10 per square meter.
  Therefore, the cost will be (L+2)(B+2) - LB * 10.
  We have two variables L and B, and only one equation L+B=170, so we cannot solve for both L and B.
  However, we can use the given information to find the cost in terms of L or B.
  Let's solve for L in terms of B from the equation L+B=170, so L=170-B.
  Substituting L=170-B in the expression for the cost, we get Cost = (170+2)(B+2) - (170-B)B * 10.
  Simplifying the above expression, we get Cost = 10B^2 + 8B + 340.
  We can now find the cost by substituting the value of B in the above expression.
  Let's assume B=50, then L=120, and the cost will be 10(50)^2 + 8(50) + 340 = 27,840.

  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The length of the plot including the boundary will be L+2 and the breadth including the boundary will be B+2.
  Therefore, the area of the boundary will be (L+2)(B+2) - LB.
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter is given as 10.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the boundary will be 10[(L+2)(B+2) - LB].
  We know that L+B=170.

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S and Joe's father's age is F.
  From the first statement, we know that J + S + F = 100.
  From the second statement, we know that when J = F, S + (F - S) * 2 = 2S.
  Simplifying the second statement, we get F - S = S.
  From the third statement, we know that when J = F, F = 2(F - S).
  Simplifying the third statement, we get F = 2S.
  We have two equations with two variables (J + S + F = 100 and F = 2S).
  Substituting F = 2S in the first equation, we get J + S + 2S = 100.
  Simplifying the equation, we get J + 3S = 100.
  We know that F = 2S, substituting this in the above equation, we get J + F/2 = 100/2.
  Simplifying this equation, we get J + F/2 = 50.
  We also know that J + F = S + F * 2.
  Substituting F = 2S, we get J + 2S = S + 4S.
  Simplifying this equation, we get J = S.
  Substituting J = S in the equation J + F/2 = 50, we get S + F/2 = 50.
  Substituting F = 2S, we get S + 2S/2 = 50.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 3S = 50.
  Therefore, S = 16.67 (approx).
  Substituting S = 16.67 in F = 2S, we get F = 33.33 (approx).
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is approximately 33.33.

  Let's assume Joe's age = J, Joe's sister's age = S, and Joe's father's age = F.
  The sum of their ages = J + S + F = 100.
  When Joe is as old as his father, let's assume their age be x. Therefore, the age difference between Joe and his father is (x - J) and (F - x) for Joe's father.
  When Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now. It means S + (x - J) = 2S => x = J + S.
  When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. It means F - x = 2(S - (F - S)) => F - x = 4S - 2F.
  We have two equations, x = J + S and F - x = 4S - 2F. We can use these equations to find the value of F.
  Substituting x = J + S in F - x = 4S - 2F, we get F - (J + S) = 4S - 2F => 3F = 5S + J.

  We have two equations now, X = 2J - S and S = 2F - Y/2. We can use these equations to find the value of F.
  Substituting the value of S in the first equation, we get X = 2J - (2F - Y/2)
  Simplifying this, we get X = 2(J + F) - Y/2
  We know that J + S + F = 100, so J + (2F - Y/2) + F = 100

  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  Let's assume the age difference between Joe and his father is x.
  So, when Joe is J+x years old, his father will be F+x years old.
  And, Joe's sister's age will be S+x years old.
  So, we can write the equation: S+x = 2S
  Solving the above equation, we get: x = S
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  Let's assume the age difference between Joe's father and Joe's sister is y.
  So, when Joe is J+y years old, his father will be F+y years old.

  So, we can write the equation: F+y = 2(S+y)
  Solving the above equation, we get: y = F-2S
  
  Now, we have three equations:

  Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. The time it takes him to return to A is also t = d/90.
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles from A to the point where he was 70 miles away from B.
  We can use the formula: distance = rate x time to solve for d.
  distance from A to the point where he was 70 miles away from B = rate x time = 70 mph x (t - 3) hours
  distance from the point where he was 70 miles away from B to B = 70 miles
  distance from B to the point where he was 70 miles away from B = rate x time = 90 mph x (t - 3) hours
  distance from A to B = distance from A to the point where he was 70 miles away from B + distance from the point where he was 70 miles away from B to B

  90(t2 + 3) = 70(t3 + t2 + 3)
  90t2 + 270 = 70t3 + 70t2 + 210
  20t2 - 70t3 = -60
  t2 - 3.5t3 = -3
  We know that t3 = 1 from the equation 70 = 70t3.
  Therefore, t2 = -0.5.
  This means that Kevin spent 0.5 hours (or 30 minutes) driving from the 70-mile point to B.
  We can use the formula distance = rate x time to find d: d = 70t1 + 90(t2 + 3) = 70(1.5) + 90(2.5) = 135 + 225 = 360.

  Let's call the distance from A to B ""d"".
  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B ""t1"".
  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A ""t2"".
  We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find t1.
  d = 70t1
  We also know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can use the same formula to find t2.
  d = 90t2
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. This means that he had already driven 70 miles from A towards B, and had 70 miles left to go from B to A.
  We can use this information to set up an equation:
  70 = 70t1 + 90(t2 - 3)

  According to the problem, the total contribution is Rs. 6 lakh.
  Therefore, nx = 600000.
  If each employee contributes Rs. 60 extra, then the new contribution per employee will be ""x+60"".
  In this case, the total contribution will be ""n(x+60)"".
  According to the problem, the new total contribution is Rs. 6.24 lakh.
  Therefore, n(x+60) = 624000.
  We can simplify these two equations to get the value of ""n"".
  nx = 600000 => x = 600000/n
  n(x+60) = 624000
  Substituting the value of x, we get:
  n(600000/n + 60) = 624000
  600000 + 60n = 624000
  60n = 24000
  n = 400

  If we plug in x = 2.25 into the equation, we get 3.50 + 0.10(4*2.25-1) = 8.50.
  The equation is true.
  We made a mistake in our calculation.
  Let's try again.
  The first quarter-mile costs $3.50, and the remaining (32-1) quarter-miles cost $0.10 each.
  Therefore, we can set up the equation: 3.50 + 0.10(32-1) = 8.50.
  Solving for x, we get x = 12.75 miles.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.
  The answer is B: 12.75 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  Therefore, the remaining amount is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00.
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Therefore, for each mile, the cab charges 4 * 10 cents = 40 cents.
  So, the cab can travel 5.00 / 0.40 = 12.5 miles.
  But, the cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  So, the maximum distance the cab can travel is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 12.75 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  We can set up an equation to solve for the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50.
  Let d be the distance we can travel in miles.
  We can represent the cost of the cab ride as:
  $3.50 + $0.10(4n-1) = $8.50, where n is the number of quarter miles traveled after the first quarter mile.
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  $0.10(4n-1) = $5.00
  4n-1 = 50
  4n = 51
  n = 12.75
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel is 1 + 12.75/4 = 4 + 3.1875 = 7.1875 miles.
  The answer is D: 14.75 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, which means we can travel 0.25 miles with $3.50.
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile, which means we can travel 0.25 miles with $0.10.
  We can calculate the maximum distance by dividing the remaining $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00 by the cost of each additional quarter mile, which is $0.10.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel is $5.00/$0.10 = 50 quarter-miles.
  50 quarter-miles is equal to 12.5 miles.
  However, we have already traveled the first quarter-mile with the initial $3.50.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.5 - 0.25 = 12.25 miles.
  The answer is not listed as a choice, but the closest answer is B: 12.75 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's assume that the total distance traveled is x miles.
  The cost of the first quarter-mile is $3.50.
  The cost of each additional quarter-mile is $0.10.
  Therefore, the cost of traveling x miles is (x-0.25)*0.10 + $3.50.
  We need to find the maximum value of x such that the cost of traveling x miles is less than or equal to $8.50.
  (x-0.25)*0.10 + $3.50 <= $8.50
  (x-0.25)*0.10 <= $5.00
  x-0.25 <= 50
  x <= 50.25
  Therefore, the maximum distance you can travel with $8.50 is 50.25 quarter-miles, which is 12.5625 miles.

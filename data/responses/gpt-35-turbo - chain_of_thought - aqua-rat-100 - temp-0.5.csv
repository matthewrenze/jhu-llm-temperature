Let's assume that there are 100 employees in total. 
If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, then 25% do not take a winter vacation. 
If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, then 60% of them do not take both vacations. 
If 20% of the employees take neither winter nor summer vacations, then 80% of them take at least one vacation. 
Let's denote the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation as ""W"", and the percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation as ""S"". 
Then, we can form the following equation: 
25% + 40% + W + S + 0% = 100%
W + S = 35%
If we subtract the percentage of employees who take both vacations (40%) from the percentage who take a summer vacation (S), we can find the percentage who take only a summer vacation: 
S - 40% = Q
S = Q + 40%
S = (35% - W) + 40%
S = 75% - W
Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is equal to S - 40%, which is equal to 75% - W - 40%, which simplifies to 35% - W.
We need to find the value of W to solve the problem. 
We know that 80% of the employees take at least one vacation. 
Therefore, W + S + 40% = 80%
W + S = 40%
W + (35% - W) = 40%
W = 5%

Let S be the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Then, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is (S+40) since 40 employees take both vacations.
The total number of employees who take at least one vacation is (75 + S + 40) since 75 employees take a winter vacation and 40 employees take both vacations.
Therefore, the number of employees who take a vacation is (75 + S + 40 - 20) = (S + 95).
We know that this number is 100% - 20% = 80% of the total number of employees.

  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation. So, 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's assume that Q% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. So, Q employees take only a summer vacation.
  We can use the formula: Total = Group 1 + Group 2 - Both + Neither
  Here, Group 1 is the number of employees who take only a winter vacation.
  Group 2 is the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  Both is the number of employees who take both vacations.
  Neither is the number of employees who take neither vacation.
  We can rearrange the formula to find Group 2.
  Group 2 = Total - Group 1 - Both + Neither
  Total = 100 (as assumed earlier)
  Group 1 = 75 (as given in the question)
  Both = 40 (as given in the question)
  Neither = 20 (as given in the question)
  Group 2 = 100 - 75 - 40 + 20 = 5

Step 1: 
  One helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
  Let's convert the large cakes to small cakes to make the calculation easier.
  One helper can make 2 x (35) = 70 small cakes/hr.

  The total number of small cakes that can be made by H helpers in 20 hours is:

  The speed of the train is given as 120 miles per hour.
  We first need to convert the speed to miles per second, since the time taken to pass through the tunnel will be in seconds.
  120 miles per hour is equal to 2 miles per minute or 1/30 miles per second.
  Let L be the length of the train.
  Then, L = 1 mile - (distance traveled by train in 3 seconds)
  Distance traveled by train in 3 seconds = (speed of train) x (time taken) = (1/30) x 3 = 1/10 miles
  Therefore, L = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10 miles
  Total distance traveled by train to pass through the tunnel = length of train + length of tunnel = L + 1 = 9/10 + 1 = 19/10 miles
  Time taken to pass through the tunnel = (distance traveled) / (speed of train) = (19/10) / (1/30) = (19/10) x (30/1) = 57 seconds
  Therefore, the answer is D: 33 seconds.

- The train enters the tunnel in 3 seconds.
- The length of the tunnel is 1 mile.
- The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
- We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
- We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
- We need to convert the length of the tunnel from miles to feet to match the speed unit.
- We also need to convert the speed from miles per hour to feet per second to match the time unit.
- The time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is the sum of the time it takes to travel the length of the tunnel and the time it takes to enter the tunnel.
- We can add the two times to get the total time.

Calculation:
- Length of tunnel in feet = 1 mile * 5280 feet/mile = 5280 feet
- Speed of train in feet per second = 120 miles/hour * 5280 feet/mile / 3600 seconds/hour = 176 feet/second
- Time to travel the length of the tunnel = distance / speed = 5280 feet / 176 feet/second = 30 seconds
- Total time = time to enter tunnel + time to travel tunnel = 3 seconds + 30 seconds = 33 seconds

  The train takes exactly three seconds to enter the one-mile long tunnel.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  To pass completely through the tunnel, the train needs to cover a distance of 2 miles (one mile to enter and one mile to exit).
  We can use the formula: distance = rate x time to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We know the distance is 2 miles, and the rate is 120 miles per hour.
  We need to convert the rate to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (number of seconds in an hour).
  Then, we can use the formula time = distance / rate to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
Calculation:
  Rate in miles per second = 120 / 3600 = 1/30
  Time = 2 / (1/30) = 60 seconds
Result:
  It will take 60 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.

  To solve for the length of the space shuttle, we need to determine its speed.
  We can determine the speed by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took to travel that distance.
  We can determine the total distance traveled by adding the height it reached and the distance it covered while passing a point.
  We can then use the speed and the time it took to pass the point to determine the length of the space shuttle.
  Distance = Height + Distance covered while passing a point
  Speed = Distance/Time
  Length = Speed x Time
  
  Height = 700m
  Time taken to reach 700m = 40 seconds
  Time taken to pass a point = 5 seconds
  Distance covered while passing a point = Speed x Time = ?
  Total distance = Height + Distance covered while passing a point = ?
  Speed = Distance/Time = ?
  Length = Speed x Time = ?
  
Calculation:
  Distance covered while passing a point = Speed x Time = 5 x Speed
  Total distance = Height + Distance covered while passing a point = 700 + 5 x Speed
  Speed = Distance/Time = Total distance / (Time taken to reach 700m + Time taken to pass a point) = (700 + 5 x Speed) / 45

  Let's assume the original price of each article is x.
  After the price decreased by 15%, the new price of each article is 0.85x.
  Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, which means she can buy a total of (300/0.85x) + 5 articles.
  We can set up the equation as follows:
    300 = [(300/0.85x) + 5] * 0.85x
  Solving for x:
    300 = (352.94 + 4.7x)
    4.7x = -52.94
    x = -11.23
  This is not a possible answer, which means we made a mistake.
  Let's double-check our equation:
    300 = [(300/0.85x) + 5] * 0.85x
    300 = (352.94 + 4.7x)
    4.7x = -52.94
    x = -11.23
  We made a mistake in the equation. Instead of multiplying by 0.85x, we should divide by 0.85x.
  Let's correct the equation and solve for x:
    300 = [(300/0.85x) + 5] / 0.85
    255 = (300/0.85x) + 5
    250 = (300/0.85x)

  Let the original price of each article be x.
  The price of each article decreased by 15%, so the new price of each article is (100% - 15%)x = 0.85x.
  Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, so the total cost of the articles is (5 + n) * 0.85x = 300, where n is the original number of articles that Anna could buy.
  We can solve for n using the equation (5 + n) * 0.85x = 300.
  Simplifying the equation, we get n = (300 / 0.85x) - 5.
  We want to find the new selling price of each article, which is the total cost of the articles divided by the new number of articles that Anna can buy.
  The new number of articles that Anna can buy is (5 + n), where n = (300 / 0.85x) - 5.
  Therefore, the new selling price of each article is 300 / (5 + n).
  We can substitute the expression for n to get the new selling price in terms of x.

Let's assume that the length and breadth of the rectangle are x and y respectively.
Perimeter of the rectangle, 2(x+y) = 48.
Therefore, x+y = 24.
When folded along the other set of sides, 2(x+y) = 66.
Therefore, x+y = 33.
Solving the above two equations, we get x = 9 and y = 15.
Area of the rectangle = length x breadth = x*y = 9*15 = 135.
When folded into two equal halves, we get two rectangles each with dimensions 4.5 x 15 and 7.5 x 9.

  Therefore, the sum of the lengths of both parts is 2(24 - b) = 48 - 2b.

Let the number of friends who attended the picnic be x.
The total amount they planned to spend was Rs. 96.
Each person would have to pay 96/x.
Since four people did not show up, the remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. 
So, the new cost per person is 96/(x-4) + 4
We know that the new cost per person is greater than the original cost per person.
Therefore, 96/(x-4) + 4 > 96/x
Multiplying both sides by x(x-4), we get:
96x + 4x(x-4) > 96(x-4)
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
4x^2 - 64x + 192 > 0
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
x^2 - 16x + 48 > 0
Factoring the above equation, we get:
(x-4)(x-12) > 0
Therefore, x > 12 or x < 4. Since x cannot be less than 4, we have x > 12.
The answer is either 16, 24, or 25.
Let's check for x = 16, 24, and 25:
For x = 16, each person pays 96/16 = 6, and the remaining 12 people pay 6+4 = 10. The total cost would be 6*16 + 12*10 = 156, which is greater than 96.
For x = 24, each person pays 96/24 = 4, and the remaining 20 people pay 4+4 = 8. The total cost would be 24*4 + 20*8 = 192, which is greater than 96.
For x = 25, each person pays 96/25 = 3.84, and the remaining 21 people pay 3.84+4 = 7.84. The total cost would be 25*3.84 + 21*7.84 = 96.

But, 4 people didn't turn up, so now the number of people who attended the picnic is (x-4).
Now, each person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, so each person's share became (96/x)+4.

So, each one of them would have contributed Rs. 96/x.
Now, 4 people did not turn up, which means only (x-4) people attended the picnic.
The remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each.
So, the new contribution per person became Rs. 96/(x-4) + 4.
We know that the new contribution per person was greater than the original contribution per person.
So, we can write the following inequality:
  96/x < 96/(x-4) + 4

  Therefore, time = 15 / 107 = 0.14 hours = 8.4 minutes.
  Converting minutes to hours, we get 8.4 / 60 = 0.14 hours.

  Let's assume that the two cars start at the same point and the distance between them is 0 miles.
  The first car travels at a steady rate of 55 mph and the second car travels at a steady rate of 52 mph.
  The relative speed of the second car with respect to the first car is 55 - 52 = 3 mph.
  The distance between the two cars increases at a rate of 3 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time when the distance between the two cars is 15 miles.
  So, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.
  15 = 3 x time
  time = 15/3 = 5
  Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other.

  For any real number x, [x] ≤ x, and [x] + 1 > x.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ 2x + 2y.
  Also, [x] + [y] + [x + y] > 2x + 2y - 3.
  Therefore, [2x] + [2y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 3.
  For any integer n, [n] = n if n is an integer, otherwise [n] = n - 1.
  Therefore, [2x] + [2y] is an even integer, and [x] + [y] + [x + y] is an integer.
  If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] and [2x] + [2y] must be even integers.
  If x and y are positive real numbers, then [x] and [y] are positive integers.
  Therefore, [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + 1.
  Therefore, [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2[x] + 2[y] + 2.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y] + 2.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] + 2 or [2x] + [2y] + 1.
  If [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] + 2, then [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] + 2 - [x] - [y] - 1 = [2x] + [2y] - [x] - [y] + 1 is an odd integer, which is impossible since [x + y] is an integer.
  If [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] + 1, then [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] - [x] - [y] is an even integer, which implies that x and y have the same fractional part.
  Therefore, x - [x] = y - [y].
  Let a = [x], b = [y], and c = [x + y] - a - b.
  Then x = a + u, y = b + u, and c = [u + a + b], where 0 ≤ u < 1.
  Then L(x,y) = a + b + c = a + b + [u + a + b] = 2a + 2b + [2u + 1].
  Also, R(x,y) = [2a + 2u] + [2b + 2u] = 2a + 2b + [4u].
  If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then [2u + 1] = [4u], which implies that 0 ≤ 2u + 1 - [2u + 1] < 1 and 0 ≤ 4u - [4u] < 1.
  Since [2u + 1] is odd and [4u] is even, we have [2u + 1] = [4u] + 1.
  Therefore, 1 ≤ 2u + 1 - 4u < 2, which implies that -1/2 < u < 1/2.
  Let u = k + 1/2, where k is an integer.
  Then x = a + k + 1/2, y = b + k + 1/2, and c = [k + a + b + 1/2].
  Since x and y are positive, a + k and b + k are positive integers.
  Therefore, c ≤ k + a + b < c + 1.
  Therefore, k + a + b + 1/2 - 1 < x + y < k + a + b + 1/2.

  Let's assume that the height of the room is ""2x"" and the semi-perimeter is ""5y"".
  Semi-perimeter = (length + breadth + length + breadth)/2 = 2(length + breadth)/2 = length + breadth = 5y
  2x/5y = 2/5
  x/y = 1/5
  Let's assume that the length of the room is ""5a"" and the breadth is ""5b"".

  4x = 2(a+b)
  a+b = 2x/2 = x
  Now, let's calculate the area of the four walls of the room.
  Area of the four walls = 2x(5a) + 2x(5b) = 10x(a+b) = 10x^2
  Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m = 15000 sq.cm
  Let the breadth of the room be ""b"" cm. Then the length of the room will be ""5y - b"" cm.
  2x(5y - b) = 15000 + area of doors and windows
  10xy - 2xb = 15000 + area of doors and windows
  10x^2 - xb = 7500 + area of doors and windows/2
  Now, let's substitute the values given in the question to find the height of the room.
  Cost of papering the walls = Rs.260
  Cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall = 260/[(2x(5a) + 2x(5b))/10000] = 26/(a+b)
  Cost of papering 1 cm of wall = (26/(a+b))/10000
  Length of paper required = 2x(5a) + 2x(5b) = 10x(a+b)
  Breadth of paper = 50 cm
  Cost of 1 cm of paper = Rs.2/100
  Cost of papering 1 cm of wall = (2/100)*50 = Rs.1
  Cost of papering 10x(a+b) cm of wall = (10x(a+b))*1 = Rs.10x(a+b)
  Therefore, (10x^2 - xb) = 7500 + 10x(a+b)
  10x^2 - xb - 10x(a+b) = 7500
  10x^2 - b(x + 10a + 10b) = 7500
  10x^2 - b(x + 2(x+b)) = 7500
  10x^2 - b(3x + 2b) = 7500
  10x^2 - 3xb - 2b^2 = 7500
  10x^2 - 3x(5y - b) - 2(5y - b)^2 = 7500
  10x^2 - 15xy + 3xb - 50y^2 + 20by - 2b^2 = 7500
  10x^2 - 15xy + 3xb - 50y^2 + 20by - 2b^2 - 7500 = 0

  The production cost of 5,040 units is 110 x 5,040 = 554,400.
  Therefore, the profit can be calculated as follows:
  Profit = 5,040x - 554,400
  We need to find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400 in a year.
  Therefore, we can set up the following inequality:
  5,040x - 554,400 >= 626,400
  Solving for x, we get:
  x >= (626,400 + 554,400)/5,040
  x >= 240
  Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $240.

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to know the yearly revenue and yearly production cost. 
Yearly revenue is the product of the monthly production and the selling price per component, multiplied by 12 months. 
Yearly production cost is the product of the monthly production and the production cost per component, multiplied by 12 months. 
The yearly profit is the difference between the yearly revenue and yearly production cost.
We can use the formula: 
Yearly profit = (selling price per component * monthly production * 12) - (production cost per component * monthly production * 12)
We can rearrange the formula to find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400.
Selling price per component = (Yearly profit + (production cost per component * monthly production * 12)) / (monthly production * 12)
Substituting the values, we get:
Selling price per component = (626400 + (110 * 420 * 12)) / (420 * 12)

  M = abc and N = cba. Therefore, M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a.
  M - N = 99(a - c), and M - N + 396c = 99(a - c + 4c) = 99(a + 3c)
  Since M > N, it follows that a > c.
  If a = 3, then the minimum value of M is 300. 
  If a > 3, then the minimum value of M is greater than 300.
  Thus, we need to find the number of possible values of M for a > 3.
  Since M = 100a + 10b + c > 300, it follows that a > 3.
  If a = 4, then c can take values from 0 to 3, and b can take values from 0 to 9. Thus, there are 4 x 10 = 40 possible values of M.
  If a = 5, then c can take values from 0 to 4, and b can take values from 0 to 9. Thus, there are 5 x 10 = 50 possible values of M.
  If a = 6, then c can take values from 0 to 5, and b can take values from 0 to 9. Thus, there are 6 x 10 = 60 possible values of M.

Solution:
  We know that M > N, so c > a.
  We also know that M - N + 396c = 990.
  Since M and N are three digit numbers, we know that a and c cannot be equal to zero.
  We can assume that c = 9 and a = 1, since this will give us the largest value of M.

  M - N = 9b + 891 > 0
  9b > -891

  b <= 9
  There are 10 possible values of b.
  We can check each value of b to see if M > 300.
  If M > 300, then we count it as a valid value of M.

  Since M > N, a > c and b > a.
  Therefore, M = abc and N = cba have the form M = 100a + 10b + c and N = 100c + 10b + a.
  Therefore, M - N = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c).
  Since M - N + 396c = 990, we have 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 11(a + 4c) = 90.
  Therefore, a + 4c = 8.
  Since a > c, we have a + 4c >= 5.
  Therefore, a = 5 and c = 1.
  Substituting these values into M = abc, we get M = 5bc, where b > 5.
  Since M > N, we have 100a + 10b + c > 100c + 10b + a.
  Simplifying this inequality, we get 99a > 99c.
  Since a = 5 and c = 1, we have 99a > 99c, and therefore M > N.
  Substituting these values into M - N + 396c = 990, we get 396 + 990 = 1386, which is true.
  Therefore, the only value of M that satisfies the conditions is M = 561.
  Since M = 5bc, where b > 5, we have b = 6 or 7 or 8 or 9.
  Therefore, there are 4 possible values of M.
  The answer is 4.

  M is a three-digit number and N is its reverse.
  Let's write M and N in expanded form.
  M = 100a + 10b + c
  N = 100c + 10b + a
  Given, M > N
  Therefore, a > c
  M - N can be written as (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
  M - N + 396c = 99(a - c) + 396c = 99a + 297c = 99(a + 3c)
  We know that M > 300, so a > 3
  The maximum value of a is 9, so a can take values from 4 to 9
  For each value of a, we need to find the number of values of c that satisfy the given equation.
  99(a + 3c) = 990 - 396c
  33(a + 3c) = 110 - 44c
  33a + 165c = 110
  11a + 55c = 37

  Since M > N, we know that a > c.
  
  Now, let's simplify the expression M - N + 396c = 990.
  We can substitute the values of M and N:

- Let's assume there are n family members. Then, we can arrange their income from lowest to highest as follows:
  x1 ≤ x2 ≤ x3 ≤ ... ≤ xn
- Since the median income is $3000, we know that:
  x(n/2) = $3000
- We also know that the total income of the family is $9000:
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = $9000
- We can use these two equations to solve for n:
  x(n/2) = $3000
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + xn = $9000
  If we substitute x(n/2) = $3000 into the second equation, we get:
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + x(n/2-1) + $3000 + x(n/2+1) + ... + xn = $9000
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  x1 + x2 + x3 + ... + x(n/2-1) + x(n/2+1) + ... + xn = $6000
- This equation tells us that the sum of the incomes of all family members except for the one with income $3000 is $6000.
- Let's assume that there are m family members who earn less than $3000. Then, there are also m family members who earn more than $3000.
- The sum of incomes of family members who earn less than $3000 is x1 + x2 + ... + xm.
- The sum of incomes of family members who earn more than $3000 is xn + ... + x(n-m+1).
- We know that x1 + x2 + ... + xm + $3000 + xn + ... + x(n-m+1) = $9000.
- We also know that x1 + x2 + ... + xm + xn + ... + x(n-m+1) = $6000.
- Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
  $3000 + m * $3000 = $9000
  m = 1
- Therefore, there is only one family member who earns less than $3000 per month, and there is one family member who earns more than $3000 per month. The remaining family members all earn exactly $3000 per month.

  Therefore, the total share of A and B is Rs.225,000.
  Let's calculate the share of A and B for the first x months. Their total investment is Rs.100,000.
  So, their profit for the first x months is (100,000/200,000)*375,000 = Rs.187,500.
  Their profit for the remaining 12-x months is (160,000/280,000)*375,000 = Rs.214,285.71.
  A and B's total profit for the year is Rs.401,785.71.

  Their profit for the remaining 10 months is (160,000/280,000)*214,285.71 = Rs.122,142.85.
  A and B's total profit for the year is Rs.229,285.71.
  Their total profit is Rs.225,000.

  Let's calculate A and B's share for the first 2 months. Their total investment is Rs.100,000.
  So, their profit for the first 2 months is (100,000/200,000)*145,714.29 = Rs.72,857.14.
  Their profit for the remaining x+10 months is (160,000/280,000)*145,714.29 = Rs.77,857.15.
  A and B's total profit for the year is Rs.150,714.29.
  Their total profit is Rs.225,000.
  Therefore, C's share is Rs.74,285.71.
  C's share is Rs.150,000.

  Let's denote the number of months that A has invested as ""a"".
  Then, the number of months that B has invested is ""b"" (where b > 2).
  And, the number of months that C has invested is ""c"" (where c > b).
  The ratio of investment of A, B, and C is 4:6:12 or 1:1.5:3.
  We can use this ratio to calculate the share of A and B.
  Then, we can use the given information to calculate the share of C and find the value of ""c"".
  The sum of the months that A, B, and C have invested is 12.
  Therefore, c = 12 - (a + b).
  Let's solve the problem step-by-step.
  
Calculation:
  Let's calculate the share of A and B.
  The total investment is Rs.220,000.
  A's investment is Rs.40,000 for 12 months.
  B's investment is Rs.60,000 for (12 - 2) = 10 months.
  C's investment is Rs.120,000 for (12 - c) months.
  The ratio of their investments is 1:1.5:3.
  A's share = (1/5) * Rs.375,000 = Rs.75,000.
  B's share = (1.5/5) * Rs.375,000 = Rs.112,500.
  C's share = Rs.150,000.
  Total profit = Rs.75,000 + Rs.112,500 + Rs.150,000 = Rs.337,500.
  Therefore, Rs.375,000 - Rs.337,500 = Rs.37,500 is the profit made after C joined the business.
  We know that C joined after B.
  Therefore, C has invested for (12 - c) months and B has invested for (12 - c + x) months (where x is the number of months after B joined the business).
  We can use the ratio of their investments to calculate the value of x.
  (120000 * (12 - c)) / (40000 * 12 + 60000 * (12 - 2) + 120000 * (12 - c)) = 150000 / 375000
  Solving this equation, we get c = 8.
  Therefore, B has invested for (12 - c + x) = 6 months.
  Hence, C joined the business after (6 - 2) = 4 months.

  Total profit = Rs.375,000
  C's share of profit = Rs.150,000
  We can now form an equation to solve for x.
  (120,000 x (12-x) / Total Investment) x Total Profit = C's Share of Profit

  The ratio of their investment is 4:6:12 which is equal to 2:3:6.
  C's share is Rs.150,000, which is equal to 6 parts of the total profit.

  B invested for 10 months, so his share is 3 parts (Rs.75,000).
  A invested for 12 months, so his share is 2 parts (Rs.50,000).
  Therefore, the total investment before C joined is equal to 2+3 = 5 parts = Rs.125,000.
  C invested for (12-x) months, so his investment is equal to 6 parts - (2+3) parts = 1 part = Rs.25,000.

  We need to find the value of x.
  Let's solve this problem using the concept of profit sharing ratio.
  A's investment = Rs.40,000 for 12 months, so his profit share ratio = (40,000 x 12) / (60,000 x 10 + 120,000 x (12 - x) + 40,000 x 12) = 12/63
  B's investment = Rs.60,000 for 10 months, so his profit share ratio = (60,000 x 10) / (60,000 x 10 + 120,000 x (12 - x) + 40,000 x 12) = 10/63

  Let's assume that the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 is 51.
  Let's consider that the first integer is x.
  The sum of k consecutive integers can be found using the formula k/2(2x + k - 1).
  Therefore, k/2(2x + k - 1) = 51.
  We know that the first integer is -50, so x = -50.

  Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth was ""x"" feet.
  After trimming 4 feet from one edge, the length of the rectangular piece becomes x-4 feet.
  The width of the rectangular piece remains x feet since it was not trimmed.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)*x = x^2 - 4x.
  The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to form two triangles.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2)*base*height.
  Let's assume the base of one triangle is ""b"" feet.
  Since the rectangular piece was cut diagonally in half, the height of the triangle is equal to the width of the rectangular piece, which is x feet.
  Therefore, (1/2)*b*x = 70.
  Solving for b, we get b = 140/x.
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x.
  We need to find the value of x that satisfies the equation b = 140/x, and then calculate the perimeter of the original square piece of cloth.
  Substituting b = 140/x in the equation x^2 - 4x = (x-4)*x = (x^2 - 4x), we get x^2 - 4x = 140.

  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)x = x^2 - 4x.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the area of both triangles is 140 square feet.
  The area of each triangle is (1/2)bh = 70, where b and h are the base and height of the triangle.
  Solving for h, we get h = (2*70)/b = 140/b.
  The diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of the right triangle with legs (x-4) and h.
  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get (x-4)^2 + (140/b)^2 = x^2.
  Simplifying and rearranging, we get b^2 - 4bx + 196 = 0.
  Applying the quadratic formula, we get b = (4x +/- sqrt(16x^2 - 784))/2 = 2x +/- sqrt(4x^2 - 196).
  Since b is the base of a triangle, it must be positive and less than x.
  Therefore, we have b = 2x - sqrt(4x^2 - 196).
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4x.
  We need to find x such that b = 2x - sqrt(4x^2 - 196) satisfies the equation (x-4)(2x - sqrt(4x^2 - 196))/2 = 70.

  Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is 'x' feet.
  After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece will have dimensions (x-4) by x.
  The diagonal of the rectangular piece will be the hypotenuse of the two triangles.
  Using Pythagorean Theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece.
  (x-4)^2 + x^2 = diagonal^2
  diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, the area of both triangles combined is 140 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
  Since both triangles are congruent, the base and height of each triangle must be equal.
  Let's assume the base and height of each triangle is 'y' feet.
  The area of each triangle is (1/2) * y * y = 70 square feet.
  Solving for 'y', we get y = 2sqrt(35) feet.
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth will be x + x + x + x = 4x.
  We need to find the value of 'x' to determine the perimeter.

Calculation:
  diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  2(70) = y^2
  y = 2sqrt(35)
  (2sqrt(35))^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  8x^2 - 32x + 32 - 280 = 0
  2x^2 - 8x - 62.5 = 0
  x = (8 + sqrt(384))/4 or x = (8 - sqrt(384))/4
  x = 5.54 or x = 1.46

  Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours, so its rate is 1/8 of the pool per hour.
  Let's assume that Hose B can fill the pool in x hours, so its rate is 1/x of the pool per hour.
  In the first 2 hours, Hose A filled: (1/8) * 2 = 1/4 of the pool.
  Let's assume that the total volume of the pool is V.
  Therefore, the remaining volume of the pool is V - 1/4V = 3/4V.
  Working together, Hose A and B filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours.

  Also, let's assume that hose B can fill the pool in y hours.
  Therefore, the rate of hose B is 1/y of the pool per hour.
  In the first 2 hours, hose A alone can fill 2/x of the pool.
  Then, the remaining part of the pool that needs to be filled is (1 - 2/x) of the pool.
  The two hoses working together can fill (1 - 2/x) of the pool in 3 hours.
  Therefore, the rate of the two hoses working together is (1 - 2/x) / 3 of the pool per hour.
  The rate of the two hoses working together is also equal to the sum of the rates of hose A and hose B.
  Therefore, (1/x) + (1/y) = (1 - 2/x) / 3
  Simplifying the equation, we get 3y(x-2) + 3x(y) = xy
  Expanding and simplifying, we get 3xy - 6y + 3xy + 3x^2 = xy
  Rearranging, we get 3x^2 - xy + 6y = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get x = (y/2) + (sqrt(3)y)/2 or x = (y/2) - (sqrt(3)y)/2
  Since x cannot be less than 2 (since hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours), we can eliminate the second solution.

  The number of deer caught and tagged during 2001 is 300.
  The number of deer caught during 2002 is 500, and only 20 of them had tags from the previous year.
  This means that 20/500 = 4% of the deer population was tagged in 2001 and still alive in 2002.
  If this percentage is representative of the total deer population, then the total number of deer in the forest can be found by dividing 300 by 4% (or 0.04).

  If 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder on division by N, then their difference must also leave the same remainder on division by N.
  The difference between 2272 and 875 is 1397.
  We know that N is a 3-digit number, so it can be written as 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, and c are digits.
  If we divide 1397 by N, we get a quotient and a remainder, both of which are integers.
  The quotient is a 2-digit number (because 1397 is less than N times 1000), so we can write it as 10x + y, where x and y are digits.
  Therefore, 1397 = N(10x + y) + r, where r is the common remainder.
  Simplifying this equation, we get 1397 = 1000Na + 100Nb + 100Nc + 10Ny + Nr.
  Rearranging terms, we get 397 = 1000Na + 100Nb + 100Nc + 10Ny + Nr - 1397.
  Simplifying further, we get 397 = 1000Na + 100Nb + 100Nc + 10Ny - 1000 + (1000 - Nr).
  Since N is a 3-digit number, it must be greater than or equal to 100.
  Therefore, 1000Na + 100Nb + 100Nc is a multiple of 1000, so it does not affect the sum of digits of N.
  We are left with the sum of digits of Ny + (1000 - Nr).
  Since Ny is a 2-digit number, its sum of digits is less than or equal to 18.
  Similarly, 1000 - Nr is a 3-digit number, so its sum of digits is less than or equal to 27.

  Let's assume the number of copper coins is x and the number of brass coins is y.
  The total amount of money the diver gets is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  The amount of money the diver gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for x copper coins is 20x cents.
  Similarly, the amount of money the diver gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, so the total amount of money she gets for y brass coins is 25y cents.
  We can write two equations based on the information given in the problem:
    20x + 25y = 340  (equation 1)
    x + y = total number of coins
  We need to find the minimum value of x.
  We can start by assuming y = 0 and finding the value of x that satisfies equation 1.
  If y = 0, then equation 1 becomes:
    20x = 340
    x = 17
  This means that the diver brought 17 copper coins and 0 brass coins.
  We can check if this is correct by verifying that the total number of coins is equal to 17 + 0 = 17, and the total amount of money the diver gets is equal to 20x + 25y = 20(17) + 25(0) = 340 cents.

  We can write an equation based on this information:

  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which means we need to find the smallest possible value of x that satisfies the equation.
  Let's try to solve the equation for x in terms of y:
  0.20x = 3.40 - 0.25y
  x = (3.40 - 0.25y)/0.20
  We know that x has to be a whole number, so we can try different values of y to see which one gives us a whole number for x.

  The amount of money she earned from copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she earned from brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she earned is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize x.
  We can solve this equation using trial and error or substitution.
  Let's try substitution.
  We can isolate y in terms of x as follows:
  25y = 340 - 20x
  y = (340 - 20x) / 25
  Since y has to be a whole number, 340 - 20x has to be a multiple of 25.
  The only multiple of 25 between 0 and 340 that is not divisible by 20 is 25.
  Let's try y = 1 and see if we get a whole number for x.
  If y = 1, then 25 = (340 - 20x) / 25
  Multiplying both sides by 25, we get:
  625 = 340 - 20x
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 14.25
  This is not a whole number, which means y cannot be 1.
  Let's try y = 2.
  If y = 2, then 50 = (340 - 20x) / 25
  Multiplying both sides by 25, we get:
  1250 = 340 - 20x
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 45

    - Equation 2: w = 2.5b

- w = 2.5b (since the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
- v = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

We know that:
- x + v = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
- x + w = ? (this is what we want to find)

To solve for x + w, we can use the fact that:
- v + w + b = 250
- v = 125
- w = 2.5b

Substituting these values, we get:
125 + 2.5b + b = 250

So we know that:

- All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both, so we know that the total number of files is 250.
- 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, meaning that 50% of the files were only infected by a worm or not infected at all. This means that the number of files infected only by a worm plus the number of files that were not infected at all is equal to 125 (half of 250).
- We can use this information to set up an equation: x + 2.5x + not infected = 125 (where ""not infected"" is the number of files that were not infected by a worm).
- Simplifying the equation, we get 3.5x + not infected = 125.
- We know that x (the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm) is less than or equal to the total number of files (250), so we can set up another equation: x + 2.5x <= 250.
- Simplifying this equation, we get 3.5x <= 250.
- Dividing both sides by 3.5, we get x <= 71.43. Since x must be a whole number, this means that x can be at most 71.
- We can use this information to find the maximum value of ""not infected"": 3.5x + not infected = 125, so not infected = 125 - 3.5x. Plugging in x = 71 (the maximum possible value), we get not infected = 2.5.

  We can now find the number of files that were infected only by a worm:
  2.5x = 2.5 x 18 = 45
  Finally, we can find the number of files that were not infected by a worm:
  Not infected by worm = Total - (Virus only + Worm only + (Virus and Worm))
  Not infected by worm = 250 - (0.5 x 250 + 45 + 18)
  Not infected by worm = 122

  Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.

  Let B be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  We know that V + W + B = 250.
  We also know that W = 2.5B.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that 50% of the files are either infected by a worm only or infected by both a virus and a worm.
  This means that W + B = 0.5(250 - V).
  We can substitute W = 2.5B into the second equation to get 3.5B = 0.5(250 - V).
  We can simplify the equation to get V = 150 - 7B.
  We know that V + W + B = 250, so we can substitute V and W = 2.5B into the equation to get 3.5B = 100.
  Solving for B, we get B = 28.57, which means that B = 28.
  We can substitute B = 28 into V = 150 - 7B to get V = 98.
  Therefore, the number of files that were not infected by a worm is 250 - (W + B) = 250 - (2.5B + B) = 250 - 3.5B = 125.

  Let's represent the number of files infected by only a virus as ""V"", the number of files infected by only a worm as ""W"", and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm as ""B"".
  We know that V + W + B = 250 (since there are 250 files in total).
  We also know that W = 2.5B (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm).
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that 50% were infected by a virus. Therefore, V + B = 0.5 * 250 = 125.
  We can use these equations to solve for W.
  From V + B = 125, we get B = 125 - V.
  Substituting this into W = 2.5B, we get W = 2.5(125 - V) = 312.5 - 2.5V.
  From V + W + B = 250, we get V + (312.5 - 2.5V) + B = 250.
  Simplifying this, we get 312.5 - 1.5V + B = 250.
  Substituting B = 125 - V, we get 437.5 - 2.5V = 250.
  Solving for V, we get V = 75.
  Therefore, B = 125 - V = 50, and W = 312.5 - 2.5V = 250.

  Let's represent the number of files that are infected only by a virus as V, the number of files that are infected only by a worm as W, and the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm as B.
  We have V + B + W = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
  We also know that W = 2.5B (since the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm)
  If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, then 50% of the files must be infected by a worm only or by both a virus and a worm.
  So we have (W + B)/250 = 0.5 (since the sum of the number of files infected only by a worm and the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm divided by the total number of files is equal to 0.5)
  Substituting W = 2.5B into the equation above, we get:
  (2.5B + B)/250 = 0.5
  Solving for B, we get B = 40.
  Substituting B = 40 and W = 2.5B = 100 into V + B + W = 250, we get V = 110.

Let the time taken for Bob to reach X be t1.
Let the time taken by Allen to return from Y to X be t2.
Let the time taken by Bob to return from X to Y be t3.
Since Allen and Bob will meet in the middle, the total distance covered by both of them is d.
We can use the formula distance = speed x time to form equations and solve for d.
Allen's distance + Bob's distance = d
54t + 78t1 = d
54t2 + 78t3 = d
Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time, which means:
78(t1+t3) = 54(t+t2) + 48

  Therefore, Allen covers d km in t hours at 54 kmph.
  Bob covers d km in t' hours at 78 kmph.
  When they meet for the first time, their total distance covered is d km, since they are moving towards each other.

  We know that they have traveled the same amount of time to meet for the first time.

  If Bob travels from Y to X and back, he travels a total of 2d km as well.
  Let's first find the time it takes for Allen and Bob to meet for the first time.
  The combined speed of Allen and Bob is 54 + 78 = 132 kmph.

  Now, let's find the distance covered by Allen and Bob before they meet for the first time.
  Allen would cover d/2 km before he meets Bob for the first time.
  Similarly, Bob would cover d/2 km before he meets Allen for the first time.
  When they meet for the first time, the total distance covered is d/2 + d/2 = d km.
  After they meet, Allen travels from Y to X and Bob travels from X to Y.
  Let's assume that Allen covers a distance of x km before they meet for the second time.
  Therefore, Bob would cover (d + 48 + d - x) km before they meet for the second time.

  A = 2^(60/2) = 2^30
  2^30 = 64 * 2^(x/2)
  2^(30 - 6) = 2^(x/2)
  2^(24) = 2^(x/2)

  The distance between City A and B is the same for both trains.
  Let's assume the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Distance traveled by Train M = S1 * 4 hours
  Distance traveled by Train N = S2 * 3.5 hours

  Relative speed = S1 + S2
  Time = D / (S1 + S2)
  Substitute D = S1 * 4 + S2 * 3.5

  We can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time
  Distance between City A and B = Distance traveled by Train M = Distance traveled by Train N
  S1 * 4 = S2 * 3.5
  S1 = (S2 * 3.5) / 4
  Substitute S1 in the equation: S1 * 240 + S2 * 210 = Time * (S1 + S2)
  Simplify the equation:
  (S2 * 3.5 * 240) / 4 + S2 * 210 = Time * (S2 * 3.5 / 4 + S2)

  S2 = 120 km/hr (approx)
  S1 = (S2 * 3.5) / 4 = (120 * 3.5) / 4 = 105 km/hr (approx)

  Let's find the time difference between the departure of Train N and the arrival of Train M in City B: 9am - 7am = 2 hours.

  Let's call the distance ""d"".
  Let's call the speed of Train M ""s1"" and the speed of Train N ""s2"".
  We know that the total time traveled by both trains is 2 hours:
  time = d / s1 + d / s2 = 2
  We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by s1s2:
  d * s2 + d * s1 = 2 * s1 * s2
  d = 2 * s1 * s2 / (s1 + s2)
  We know that Train M travels for 4 hours, so the distance it covers is:
  distance = speed * time = s1 * 4
  Similarly, the distance covered by Train N is:
  distance = speed * time = s2 * 3.5
  We now have the distance and can calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet:
  time = distance / (s1 + s2) = (2 * s1 * s2 / (s1 + s2)) / (s1 + s2) = 2 * s1 * s2 / (s1 + s2)^2
  Let's plug in the values we know:
  s1 = distance / time = 4s1 / (4-2) = 2s1
  s2 = distance / time = 3.5s2 / (10.5-7) = 1.75s2
  time = 2 * s1 * s2 / (s1 + s2)^2 = 2 * 2s1 * 1.75s2 / (2s1 + 1.75s2)^2 = 7s1s2 / (4s1^2 + 7s1s2 + 2.25s2^2)
  We can simplify this equation by letting x = s1/s2:
  time = 7 / (4x^2 + 7x + 2.25)
  We can now find the value of x that minimizes the time:
  time' = -28x^2 / (4x^2 + 7x + 2.25)^2 + 7(4x+7) / (4x^2 + 7x + 2.25)^2
  We set time' to zero and solve for x:
  -28x^2 + 28x + 49 = 0
  x = (sqrt(7) - 2) / 2 or x = (-sqrt(7) - 2) / 2
  We take the positive value of x, since s1 and s2 are positive:
  x = (sqrt(7) - 2) / 2
  We can now find the time it takes for the two trains to meet:
  time = 7 / (4x^2 + 7x + 2.25) = 7 / (4(7-4sqrt(7)) + 7sqrt(7) + 2.25) = 7 / (25 + 7sqrt(7))

  Using the formula distance = speed x time for both trains, we get:

  We know that s1 and s2 are positive numbers and s2 is less than s1 + s2. Therefore, s2/(s1 + s2) is a positive number less than 1. Hence, x is greater than d/(s1 + s2).
  Therefore, the time taken by the trains to cross each other is greater than d/(s1 + s2).
  Let's substitute the values now.
  We know that d is the distance between City A and City B. Let's assume it is 400 km (this is not given in the question).
  Train M takes 4 hours to cover this distance. Therefore, its speed s1 is 100 km/hour.
  Train N takes 3.5 hours to cover this distance. Therefore, its speed s2 is 114.29 km/hour (rounded to 2 decimal places).
  Substituting these values, we get: x - 114.29/(100 + 114.29) = 400/(100 + 114.29)
  Solving this equation, we get: x = 2.25 hours
  Therefore, the trains cross each other 2.25 hours after 5 am, which is at 7:15 am.
  The answer is B: 1 hr 15 min.

  The length of the rectangular plot with the boundary will be L+2 and the breadth will be B+2.
  The area of the rectangular plot with the boundary will be (L+2) x (B+2).
  The area of the rectangular plot without the boundary will be L x B.

  Each time the coin is flipped, there are two possible outcomes: Heads or Tails.
  If the coin landed on Heads x times, then it will land on Tails (20 - x) times.
  Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan each time the coin lands on Heads.
  Jonathan will give $3 to Christopher each time the coin lands on Tails.
  If no one wins or loses any amount, then the total amount of money exchanged must be zero.
  The amount of money exchanged can be calculated as follows: 
    2x - 3(20 - x) = 0
    2x - 60 + 3x = 0
    5x = 60

  For every coin flip, one of two things will happen: either Christopher will give $2 to Jonathan or Jonathan will give $3 to Christopher.
  Let's say the coin landed on Heads x times. This means that the coin landed on Tails (20 - x) times.
  The amount of money that Christopher will give to Jonathan is 2 * x.
  The amount of money that Jonathan will give to Christopher is 3 * (20 - x).
  If the two amounts are equal, then we have the equation: 2 * x = 3 * (20 - x).

  Let's assume that the distance between A and B is ""d"" miles.
  Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, and then he turned around and drove from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph.
  Let's assume that he drove for ""t"" hours from A to B at 70 mph, then he turned around and drove for ""t"" hours from B to A at 90 mph.
  Therefore, the total time he spent driving is ""2t"" hours.
  Three hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he had already driven ""d - 70"" miles from A to B, and he had ""3"" hours left to drive.
  At this point, he was driving at 90 mph, so he would be able to cover a distance of ""270"" miles in ""3"" hours.
  Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
  d - 70 + 270 = 2t * 90
  d + 200 = 180t
  d/180 + 200/180 = t
  d/180 + 10/9 = t
  We know that he had already driven ""d - 70"" miles from A to B, so we can set up the following equation:
  d - 70 = 70t
  d/70 - 1 = t
  We can equate the two expressions for ""t"" and solve for ""d"":
  d/180 + 10/9 = d/70 - 1
  d/180 + 19/9 = d/70
  7d + 2520 = 1620d

  Let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B ""t1"".
  We can use the formula: distance = rate × time (d = rt) to find t1.
  d = rt1
  t1 = d/r
  Similarly, let's call the time it took Kevin to drive from B to A ""t2"".
  t2 = d/90
  We are given that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that at time t1 - 3, Kevin had driven 70 miles away from B.
  We can use the formula: distance = rate × time (d = rt) to find t1 - 3.
  70 = 70(t1 - 3)
  t1 = 73
  Now we can use t1 and t2 to find d.

  Similarly, when Kevin returned from B to A, he drove at a constant speed of 90 mph. Let's call the time it takes for him to return ""t'"".
  We know that Kevin started his return trip exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. Therefore, the total time of his trip is:
    t + t' + 3
  We also know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. Therefore, when he turned around at B, he had driven:
    d - 70 miles
  We can use this information to set up another equation:
    d - 70 = 90t'
  Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can solve for ""d"".
  Solving the first equation for ""t"", we get:
    t = d / 70
  Substituting this expression for ""t"" into the second equation, we get:
    d - 70 = 90t'
    d - 70 = 90(t + 3 - t)
    d - 70 = 90(3) - 20d / 7

- Let's assume that the distance between A and B is ""d"" miles.
- Kevin travels from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, so the time he takes to travel from A to B is d/70 hours.
- Kevin turns around and travels from B to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. So, the time he takes to travel from B to A is d/90 hours.
- Kevin was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it, 3 hours before the end of his trip.
- Let's assume that Kevin took ""t"" hours to travel from A to B, so the total time he took for the entire trip is (d/70) + (d/90) + t hours.
- 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin had traveled for (d/70) + (d/90) + t - 3 hours.
- At that time, he was 70 miles away from B, so the distance he had traveled at that time is d - 70 miles.
- We can now create an equation using the above information and solve for ""d"".

Equation:
(d/70) + (d/90) + t - 3 = (d - 70)/90

Calculation:
Multiplying both sides by 6300 (LCD of 70, 90):
9d + 7d + 6300t - 18900 = 7d - 4900
2d + 6300t = 14000
2d = 14000 - 6300t
d = 7000 - 3150t

- Therefore, the distance between A and B is 7000 - 3150t miles.
- To find ""t"", we need another equation. We know that Kevin traveled for a total of (d/70) + (d/90) + t hours.

Equation:
(d/70) + (d/90) + t = (2d/90) + 3

Calculation:
Multiplying both sides by 630 (LCD of 70, 90):
9d + 7d + 630t = 140d + 1890
16d + 630t = 1890
Substituting d = 7000 - 3150t:
16(7000 - 3150t) + 630t = 1890
112000 - 50400t + 630t = 1890
50400t = 110110
t = 2.1851

- Therefore, the distance between A and B is:
d = 7000 - 3150t
d = 7000 - 3150(2.1851)
d = 90.4975

  This equation implies that E must be 7 or 2, otherwise, the right-hand side of the equation would be less than 99999.
  If E = 7, then D must be 1, otherwise, the right-hand side of the equation would be greater than 99999.
  Substituting E = 7 and D = 1 into the equation results in 69999 = 299999A + 30009B + 3000C.

  According to the problem statement, if we add a 1 after the number, it becomes ""abcde1"" and is three times as large as if we add a 1 before the number, which would be ""1abcde"".
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 
  10^4 * a + 10^3 * b + 10^2 * c + 10 * d + e + 1 = 3 * (10^5 + 10^4 * a + 10^3 * b + 10^2 * c + 10 * d + e + 1)
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  296 * 10^3 = 999 * a + 99 * e
  Since a is a digit, the maximum value of 999 * a is 8991, which means that 99 * e must be at least 296000 - 8991 = 287009.
  The minimum value of e that satisfies this condition is 9.
  Therefore, we can write a new equation:
  999 * a + 99 * 9 = 296091
  Solving this equation, we get a = 3.
  So, the 5 digit number is 3bcde.
  Now, we can use the original equation to find the value of the remaining digits.

  Let's assume the 5 digit number is 'abcde'.
  According to the problem, with a 1 after it, the number becomes 'abcde1' and is 3 times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is '1abcde'.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows: 10 * abcde + 1 = 3 * (10000 + abcde)

  We know that ""abcde1"" is 3 times ""1abcde"".

- If each employee contributed Rs. x, then the total amount collected would be the product of x and the number of employees.
- We can create two equations with two unknowns based on the given information:
  1. x * n = 600000
  2. (x + 60) * n = 624000
- We can solve for n by dividing the second equation by the first equation and simplifying:
  (x + 60) * n / (x * n) = 624000 / 600000
  x / (x + 60) = 26 / 25
  25x = 26x + 1560
  x = 1560 / 1 = 1560
- We can substitute x = 1560 into the first equation to find n:
  1560 * n = 600000
  n = 600000 / 1560 = 384.6

  Let the number be x.
  The student found the value of (7/18)x instead of (7/8)x.
  The difference between the actual value and the value found by the student is 770.
  (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
  Multiplying both sides by 72 gives:
  63x - 28x = 55440
  35x = 55440
  x = 1584

  Let's assume the actual number be x.
  According to the question, 7/8 of the number is x*(7/8) and 7/18 of the number is x*(7/18).
  The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, which is x*(7/18).
  The difference between the actual value and the student's value is 770.
  Therefore, the equation will be: x*(7/8) - x*(7/18) = 770
  Solving the above equation, we will get x = 2520.

  Let's say the actual number is x.
  The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, so the student's answer is (7/18)x.
  The student should have found 7/8 of the number, so the correct answer is (7/8)x.
  The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770.
  So, we can write an equation: (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
  Simplifying the equation: (35/72)x = 770

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  We can subtract $3.50 from $8.50 to get the amount available for the additional quarter miles.
  $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  We can divide the remaining amount by 0.10 to find the number of additional quarter miles we can travel.
  $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter miles
  The maximum distance we can travel is the distance covered by the first quarter mile plus the additional quarter miles.
  1 quarter mile + 50 quarter miles = 51 quarter miles
  We can convert quarter miles to miles by dividing by 4.
  51 quarter miles / 4 = 12.75 miles

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  The remaining distance that can be traveled with $5 is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.
  For every additional quarter-mile, the cab charges 10 cents.
  The maximum distance can be calculated by dividing the remaining amount by the cost per quarter-mile.
  The cost per quarter-mile is $0.10.
  The maximum distance is $5 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles.
  One mile is equal to 4 quarter-miles.
  Therefore, the maximum distance in miles is 50 / 4 = 12.5 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's assume that the maximum distance we can travel is x miles.
  We can write an equation to calculate the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50.
  $8.50 = $3.50 + 0.10 * 4 * (x - 0.25)
  Simplifying the equation, we get
  $5.00 = $0.40x - $0.40
  $5.40 = $0.40x
  x = $5.40 / $0.40
  x = 13.5 miles
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 13.5 miles.
  However, we need to round down to the nearest quarter-mile, since the cab charges based on quarter-mile increments.
  The nearest quarter-mile is 13.25 miles.
  Let's check if we can travel 13.25 miles with $8.50.
  The first quarter-mile costs $3.50.
  The remaining 13 miles cost 13 * 4 * $0.10 = $5.20.
  The total cost is $3.50 + $5.20 = $8.70, which is more than $8.50.
  Therefore, we cannot travel 13.25 miles with $8.50.
  The farthest we can travel with $8.50 is 13 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.
  We need to calculate the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50.
  Let's subtract the initial charge of $3.50 from $8.50 which leaves us with $5.00.
  Every additional quarter-mile costs 10 cents, so 1 mile (4 quarters) costs 40 cents.
  Therefore, with $5.00, we can travel 12.5 miles (50 quarters) in addition to the initial quarter-mile.
  This means that the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

  The total cost of our journey will be 3.50 + 0.10x dollars.
  We want to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50.
  So, we need to solve the following inequality: 3.50 + 0.10x <= 8.50.

  The cost of each additional quarter mile is $0.10.
  We can create an equation to represent the total cost of the trip, which is equal to $8.50:
  $3.50 + $0.10(4x - 1) = $8.50
  Simplifying the equation, we get:

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, which means it covers the first quarter-mile with $3.50.
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile. This means that the cab covers each additional quarter-mile with 10 cents.
  We need to find the maximum distance that can be covered with $8.50.
  We can use the formula: Total Cost = Cost for the first quarter-mile + Cost for each additional quarter-mile * Number of additional quarter-miles
  We can rearrange the formula as: Number of additional quarter-miles = (Total Cost - Cost for the first quarter-mile) / Cost for each additional quarter-mile
  Substituting the given values, we get: Number of additional quarter-miles = ($8.50 - $3.50) / $0.10 = 50
  Therefore, the total distance covered = distance covered in the first quarter-mile + distance covered in the additional 50 quarter-miles
  Distance covered in the first quarter-mile = 0.25 miles
  Distance covered in the additional 50 quarter-miles = 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles
  Total distance covered = 0.25 + 12.5 = 12.75 miles

  So, the remaining amount is $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  This means for each dollar, the cab will travel 2.5 miles (because 1 dollar = 100 cents, and 100/10 = 10 quarters, which is equivalent to 2.5 miles)
  Therefore, for $5.00, the cab will travel 5 x 2.5 = 12.5 miles
  Adding the first quarter-mile, the maximum distance you can travel is 12.5 + 0.25 = 12.75 miles.

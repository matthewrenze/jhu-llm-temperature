  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation and 25 employees do not take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take a winter and summer vacation.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees do not take a winter or summer vacation.
  We need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's denote this percentage by Q.
  The total number of employees who take a summer vacation can be calculated by subtracting the number of employees who do not take a summer vacation from the total number of employees.
  Total number of employees = 100
  Number of employees who do not take a summer vacation = 25 (since 75% of employees take a winter vacation, only 25% do not take a winter vacation, and hence do not take a summer vacation)
  Number of employees who take a summer vacation = 100 - 25 = 75
  We know that 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and we need to find the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  Let's assume that x employees take only a summer vacation.
  Then, the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is 40 + x.
  We know that 75 employees take a summer vacation in total.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  75 = 40 + x + y, where y is the number of employees who do not take either a summer or winter vacation.
  We know that 20 employees do not take either a summer or winter vacation.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation:
  y = 20
  Substituting this value of y in the previous equation, we get:
  75 = 40 + x + 20
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = 15
  Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
  Percentage = (Number of employees who take only a summer vacation/Total number of employees) x 100
  Percentage = (15/100) x 100
  Percentage = 15%

  40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find out how many employees take only a winter vacation.
  To do that, we can subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take a winter vacation:
  75 - 40 = 35 employees take only a winter vacation.
  Now, we need to find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  To do that, we can subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take a summer vacation:
  Let S be the number of employees taking a summer vacation only.
  S - 40 = Q
  We know that 20 employees take neither vacation, so the total number of employees who take at least one vacation is:
  75 + S + 40 = 100 - 20 = 80

  The distance traveled in 1 second is the length of the train that is still outside the tunnel when the front of the train enters the tunnel.

  We know that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so it will take ""t+3"" seconds to completely pass through the tunnel.
  Using the formula, we can set up the equation:
  1/30 = 1/(t+3)
  Solving for ""t"", we get:
  t = 27 seconds.
  Therefore, it will take 27 + 3 = 30 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

  We have:
  - 45 books in total
  - 30 hardcover books
  - 20 fiction books
  Let A be the set of hardcover books and B be the set of fiction books.
  We want to find the maximum number of books that are both in set A and set B.
  We can use the inclusion-exclusion principle:
  |A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A U B|
  where |A| is the number of elements in set A, |B| is the number of elements in set B, |A U B| is the number of elements in the union of set A and set B.
  We know that |A| = 30, |B| = 20, and |A U B| <= 45 (the total number of books).
  Therefore:
  |A ∩ B| = |A| + |B| - |A U B|
           = 30 + 20 - |A U B|
           = 50 - |A U B|
  To maximize |A ∩ B|, we need to minimize |A U B|.
  Since |A U B| <= 45, the maximum value of |A ∩ B| is 50 - 45 = 5.

It means that the selling price of the sewing machine after a 20% discount should be 120% of the cost price.
Let's find the selling price of the sewing machine after a 20% discount.
  Selling price after 20% discount = 80% of the marked price.
  Selling price after 20% discount = 80/100 * Marked Price.
  Selling price after 20% discount = 0.8 * Marked Price.
Also, Karan wants to make a 20% profit on the selling price after the discount.
  Selling price after 20% profit = 120% of the selling price after a 20% discount.

  Selling price = Marked price - Discount
  Discount = 20% of Marked price
  Selling price = Marked price - (20/100)*Marked price

  Cost price + Profit = Selling price
  Rs. 1200 + 0.16*Marked price = 0.8*Marked price

To solve this problem, we can break it down into three steps:
1. Choose the first consonant: There are 20 consonants to choose from.
2. Choose the vowel: There are 5 vowels to choose from.
3. Choose the second consonant: There are 19 consonants left to choose from since we cannot repeat the first consonant. 

Using the multiplication principle, we can multiply the number of choices for each step to get the total number of possible codes.

  The number of students excluding the highest and lowest scorers is z - 2.

  If we subtract the highest and lowest score from the sum of all scores, we get:
  T = S - h - l = yz - h - l
  We already know h + l = 2x.
  We need to express h and l in terms of other variables.
  Let the second highest score be s2 and the second lowest score be s1.
  s2 > l > s1
  h = s2
  l = s1
  We need to express s2 and s1 in terms of other variables.
  Let the sum of all scores excluding the highest and lowest scorers be T'.

  T' = (S - h - l) - s2 - s1
  T' = yz - h - l - s2 - s1
  T' = yz - 2x - s2 - s1
  We know that there are at least 5 students in the class, so z - 2 >= 3.
  Therefore, we can express s2 + s1 in terms of T'.
  s2 + s1 = S - h - l - T'
  s2 + s1 = yz - h - l - T'
  s2 + s1 = yz - 2x - T'
  We can substitute this into T' / (z - 2) = ?
  T' / (z - 2) = (yz - 2x - T') / (z - 2)
  T' / (z - 2) = (yz - 2x) / (z - 2) - T' / (z - 2)

  We need to find the length of the space shuttle.
  We know that the time it takes to pass a point is 5 seconds.
  We also know that the shuttle takes 40 seconds to travel a height of 700m.
  Since the shuttle travels at a constant speed, we can use the formula: distance = speed x time.
  Let's start by finding the speed of the shuttle.
  The shuttle travels 700m in 40 seconds, so its speed is:
  speed = distance / time = 700 / 40 = 17.5 m/s.
  Now, let's find the distance the shuttle travels during the 5 seconds it takes to pass a point.
  distance = speed x time = 17.5 x 5 = 87.5 m.
  Finally, we can find the length of the shuttle by adding the distance it travels during the 5 seconds to the distance it travels during the 40 seconds:
  length = distance during 5 seconds + distance during 40 seconds = 87.5 + 700 = 787.5 m.

  Let's assume that the length of the side with no fence is x meters.
  The area of the rectangular yard is given as 240 square meters.
  The rectangular yard has 3 sides fenced, so we need to find the perimeter of the fenced area.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(l + w), where l is the length and w is the width.
  If we let the width of the rectangle be y meters, then we can express the length in terms of the width as follows:
  x = 240 / y
  The length of the fenced area is then (x + y + x) = (2x + y)
  We know that one side of 10 meters is not fenced, so the perimeter of the fenced area is (2x + y + y) = (2x + 2y) - 10
  We can then substitute the expression for x in terms of y to get:
  P = 2(240/y + y) - 10
  We need to find the value of P.
  We can simplify the expression for P by multiplying out the brackets and collecting like terms:
  P = 480/y + 2y - 10
  To find the value of y that minimizes P, we can differentiate with respect to y and set the derivative equal to zero:
  dP/dy = -480/y^2 + 2 = 0
  Solving for y, we get y = sqrt(240).
  We can substitute this value of y into the expression for P to get the minimum perimeter:
  P = 2(240/sqrt(240) + sqrt(240)) - 10
  P = 2(sqrt(240) + 20sqrt(6)) - 10

  Equation 1: x*y = 240 (as the area of the yard is 240 square meters)
  Equation 2: x + 2y = perimeter of the yard (as Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard)
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters, so x + y + 10 = perimeter of the yard.
  Therefore, we can substitute x + 2y = x + y + 10 + y = x + 2y + 10 into Equation 2.
  x + 2y = x + 2y + 10
  0 = 10
  This is not possible, so we made an error in our calculation.
  Let's try a different approach.
  We know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the yard, so the perimeter of the yard is x + 2y - 10.
  We also know that the perimeter of the yard is equal to the sum of the lengths of the three sides that are fenced.
  Therefore, x + 2y - 10 = x + y + x
  Simplifying this equation gives us y = x/2 - 5
  We can substitute this value of y into Equation 1 to get x^2/2 - 5x = 240
  Solving for x using the quadratic formula gives us x = 20 or x = -24 (we reject the negative value)

  We can use the area equation to solve for one variable and then substitute it into the fencing equation to solve for the total length of fencing required.
  l * w = 240
  l = 240 / w

  L + L + (W-10) = 2L + W - 10 = 2(240/W) + W - 10
  To minimize the length of fencing required, we need to find the value of W that minimizes this expression.
  We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to W, setting it equal to zero, and solving for W.
  The derivative of the expression is -480/W^2 + 1.
  Setting this equal to zero and solving for W, we get W = sqrt(480) ≈ 21.91.
  Plugging this value of W back into the expression for the total length of fencing required, we get:
  2(240/W) + W - 10 ≈ 2(240/21.91) + 21.91 - 10 ≈ 11.00 + 11.91 ≈ 22.91.
  Therefore, Alice needs approximately 22.91 meters of fencing.

  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then she was able to buy (5 + x) articles before the price decrease, where x is the number of articles she could buy after the price decrease.
  Let's assume the original price of each article was p. Then the new price after the 15% decrease is (p - 0.15p) = 0.85p.
  If Anna can buy (5 + x) articles for $300 after the price decrease, then we can write the following equation:

  Also, the total area of the sheet = 2 * ((11L/3) - (L^2)/9) = (22L/3) - (2L^2)/9.
  Equating the above two equations, we get 24L - (L^2)/2 = (22L/3) - (2L^2)/9.
  Solving the above equation, we get L = 24cm.
  Therefore, the area of the sheet = L * B = 24 * (48 - 2L)/4 = 288cm^2.

  Let the length and width of the rectangular sheet be l and w.
  When folded along one set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 48cm. So each part will have length l/2 and width w. Therefore, 2(l/2 + w) = 48, which simplifies to l + w = 24.
  When folded along the other set of sides, the perimeter of each part is 66cm. So each part will have length l and width w/2. Therefore, 2(l + w/2) = 66, which simplifies to l + w = 33.
  We have two equations with two variables. By adding them together, we get 2l + 2w = 57, which simplifies to l + w = 28.5.
  Solving for w in the equation l + w = 24, we get w = 24 - l.
  Substituting w in the equation l + w = 28.5, we get l + (24 - l) = 28.5, which simplifies to l = 16.5.
  Substituting l and w in the formula for area of a rectangle, we get Area = l * w = 16.5 * 7.5 = 123.75 cm^2.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular sheet are L and B, respectively.
  When folded along the length L, each part's perimeter becomes 48 cm, so each folded part's length becomes L/2.
  That means, 2(L/2) + B = 48, which simplifies to L + B = 48.  (Equation 1)
  Similarly, when folded along the breadth B, each part's perimeter becomes 66 cm, so each folded part's breadth becomes B/2.
  That means, L + 2(B/2) = 66, which simplifies to L + B = 66. (Equation 2)
  We can solve equations 1 and 2 simultaneously to find the values of L and B.
  Adding equations 1 and 2, we get: 2L + 2B = 114.

Let the number of friends who were supposed to attend the picnic be x.
The total amount to be spent on eatables is Rs. 96.
Therefore, each friend was supposed to contribute 96/x Rs.
But since 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, now each friend contributed (96/x) + 4 Rs.
The total amount contributed now is (96 + 4x) Rs.
We know that (96/x) = [(96 + 4x)/(x - 4)]
Solving this equation gives us x = 12

  Let the number of friends be x.
  Total amount spent on eatables is Rs. 96.
  Each person initially contributed Rs. 96/x.
  As 4 people did not turn up, the remaining people had to divide Rs. 96 among (x-4) people.
  Each person then contributed Rs. (96/(x-4)).
  As each person had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, the new contribution by each person is (96/x) + 4.
  Therefore, the equation can be written as (96/x) + 4 = 96/(x-4)
  Solving the equation, we get x= 12.

Let's assume the number of friends who decided to go on a picnic is 'x' and the cost per person is 'y'.
So, the total cost of eatables is xy = 96.
When 4 friends didn't turn up, the remaining friends had to pay an additional Rs. 4 each, which means they paid a total of Rs. (xy + 4(4)) = (xy + 16).
We can set up an equation as (xy + 16) / (x-4) = y
This equation says that the cost per person after 4 friends didn't turn up is equal to the total cost divided by the number of people who attended (which is x - 4).
Now we can simplify this equation to xy + 16 = y(x-4)
We can further simplify this equation to 16 = 4y, which means y = 4.
Substituting y=4 in the first equation xy = 96, we get x = 24.
Therefore, the number of friends who attended the picnic is 24 - 4 = 20.

Let's assume that n friends planned to go on a picnic.
The cost of eatables was Rs. 96.
So, each of the n friends would have contributed Rs. 96/n.
But, 4 friends did not turn up, so the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, the new cost per person became (96 + 4)/ (n - 4).
Therefore, (96/n) + 4 = (100/n-4)
On solving this equation, we can find n, which would be the number of friends who attended the picnic.
Let's solve the equation:
96 + 4n = 100
4n = 4
n = 1

Let's assume N is the number of friends who initially planned to go on a picnic.
The total cost of eatables for N friends is Rs. 96.
The cost per person is 96/N.
After 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to pay Rs. 4 extra each.
So the new cost per person is 96/(N-4) + 4.
The new cost per person is greater than the initial cost, so we can set up the following equation:
96/N < 96/(N-4) + 4
Solving this inequality, we get N > 12.

Let the number of friends who decided to go on a picnic = x
Each friend had to contribute x = 96/x
But 4 of them did not turn up, so the remaining people had to contribute 4 extra each, which means each of them contributed x+4
So, the remaining people spent (x-4)(x+4) = 96(x+4)/x
This simplifies to x^2 - 16x - 384 = 0
We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:
x = (16 ± sqrt(16^2 + 4*384))/2
x = (16 ± 32)/2
x = 24 or -8
We can ignore the negative root as it does not make sense in this context.

- To find the least possible number of students, we need to find the smallest number that satisfies the given conditions.
- We know that 20% of the students took physics, and 28% of the students took math. However, there could be some overlap between these groups, meaning that some students took both physics and math.
- Since we don't know how many students took both, we can find the least possible number of students by assuming that all students who took physics are different from all students who took math.
- If we add the number of students who took physics (20% of the total) to the number of students who took math (28% of the total), we might count some students twice (the ones who took both). Therefore, we need to subtract the overlap (the students who took both) from the total.
- The overlap cannot be more than the smaller of the two groups (the students who took physics or the students who took math).
- Let x be the number of students who took physics. Then the number of students who took math is 0.28x. The total number of students is more than 501, so x + 0.28x > 501.
- Solving for x, we get x > 357.14. Since x must be an integer, the smallest possible value is x = 358.
- Therefore, the smallest possible number of students is the number of students who took physics plus the number of students who took math, minus the overlap, which is 358 + 0.28x - x = 358 + 0.28(358) - 358 = 100.24.
- We need to round up to the nearest integer, since we can't have a fractional number of students. Therefore, the least possible number of students is 101.

We are given that [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
We are also given that L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].
We need to determine if it is possible or not to find two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y), L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y), L(x,y) < R(x,y) or L(x,y) > R(x,y).
Let's try to solve this problem by elimination.
Option B says that L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y). This is incorrect because we can easily find positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). For example, if we take x = 1/2 and y = 1/4, then [x] = 0, [y] = 0, [x+y] = 1, [2x] = 1, and [2y] = 0. Therefore, L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] = 1 + 0 = 1, so L(x,y) = R(x,y).
Option B is eliminated. 
Option E says none of the above. We have already eliminated option B. So, we need to choose between options A, C, and D.
Option A says that it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y). This is incorrect because we have already found positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y) in option B.
Option A is also eliminated.
Option C says that L(x,y) < R(x,y). This is incorrect because we can easily find positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y). For example, if we take x = 1/2 and y = 1/4, then L(x,y) = R(x,y) = 1, so L(x,y) < R(x,y) is not true.
Option C is also eliminated.
Option D says that L(x,y) > R(x,y). This is true for all positive real numbers x and y. To see why, note that [x] + [y] + [x + y] can be at most 3[x + y], which is less than or equal to 3(2x + 2y - 1) = 6(x + y) - 3. Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] < 6(x + y) - 2[x + y] - 3 = 4(x + y) - 3 ≤ 4[x + y], so [x] + [y] + [x + y] < 4[x + y]. Therefore, L(x,y) < 4(x + y). On the other hand, [2x] + [2y] = 2[x] + 2[y], which is at most 4(x + y) - 2. Therefore, R(x,y) ≤ 4(x + y) - 2. Therefore, L(x,y) > R(x,y) is true for all positive real numbers x and y.

  We know that [x + y] <= x + y, so [x] + [y] + [x + y] <= 2x + 2y.
  Thus, we have L(x,y) <= 2x + 2y.
  On the other hand, [2x] <= 2x and [2y] <= 2y. Thus, [2x] + [2y] <= 2x + 2y.

Let's assume the marked price of the watch is M.
When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he sells it for 0.95M.
When he gives a 7% discount, he sells it for 0.93M.
Given that the profit earned by the shopkeeper is Rs. 15 less when he gives a 7% discount.
Let's assume the profit percentage on the marked price of the watch is P.

  The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m, which means the area of the room is (15 + Area of walls).

  Let's assume the width of the room is y.
  Then, the area of the room is 2x * y.

  Distance for the first part of the journey = Speed * Time = 5 * 6 = 30 km
  Distance for the second part of the journey = Speed * Time = 4 * 12 = 48 km
  Total distance = 30 + 48 = 78 km
  Total time = 6 + 12 = 18 hrs

We can use Equation 1 to simplify and solve for x in terms of y:

Therefore, we can use the formula: Annual Profit = (Selling Price x Annual Units Sold) - (Production Cost per Unit x Annual Units Sold) to solve for the minimum selling price per component.
Annual Profit = $626,400, Annual Units Sold = 420 x 12 = 5,040, and Production Cost per Unit = $110. 
Thus, we can write the equation as follows:
$626,400 = (Selling Price x 5,040) - ($110 x 5,040)
Solving for Selling Price, we get:
Selling Price = ($626,400 + ($110 x 5,040)) / 5,040
Selling Price = $240
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $240.

To calculate the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to figure out the total revenue received for selling 420 units of the component in a month. 
Revenue = Selling Price * Quantity Sold
Total revenue generated in a month = 420 * Selling Price
Total revenue generated in a year = 12 * 420 * Selling Price
Profit in a year = Total Revenue – Total Production Cost
Profit in a year = 12 * 420 * Selling Price – (12 * 420 * 110)
Profit in a year = 12 * 420 * (Selling Price – 110)
Profit in a year = 5,02,080 (Given)
5,02,080 = 12 * 420 * (Selling Price – 110)
Selling Price – 110 = 100

  12 miles/hour = 12/60 miles/minute = 0.2 miles/minute
  To travel 48 miles at a speed of 0.2 miles/minute:
  time = distance / speed = 48 / 0.2 = 240 minutes
  Therefore, it will take 240 minutes to travel 48 miles.

  If we sort the income data in ascending order, the median income is the (n+1)/2-th smallest income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 must be equal to the sum of the incomes above $3000.
  Let's say there are k members in the family who earn less than or equal to $3000.

  The sum of incomes below $3000 is k*$3000 and the sum of incomes above $3000 is (n-k)*$3000.

  The total investment of A, B, and C is 40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*x, where x is the number of months C invested in the business.
  The total profit is Rs.375,000 and C's share is Rs.150,000, so A and B's share is Rs.225,000.
  Let's assume that A and B's investment is constant throughout the year. Then, their share of the profit is proportional to the time they have invested in the business.
  A's share = (40000*12/40000+60000*10/40000+120000*x)*225000 = 60000
  B's share = (60000*10/40000+120000*x)*225000 = 90000
  C's share = (120000*x)*225000 = 150000
  A+B+C's share = 60000+90000+150000 = 300000, which is less than the total profit. This means that there is some other profit that is not shared among A, B, and C.
  The profit not shared among A, B, and C = 375000-300000 = 75000
  Let's assume that the profit not shared among A, B, and C is also proportional to the time they have invested in the business.
  A's share of the unshared profit = (40000*12/40000+60000*10/40000+120000*x)*75000 = 20000
  B's share of the unshared profit = (60000*10/40000+120000*x)*75000 = 30000
  C's share of the unshared profit = (120000*x)*75000 = 25000
  A+B+C's share of the unshared profit = 20000+30000+25000 = 75000, which is equal to the unshared profit.
  Therefore, we can solve for x:
  120000*x = 25000
  x = 5/24 year = 60/24 months = 2.5 months

  Let the time after B joined until C joined be x months.
  A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  Let the share of A and B be a and b respectively.
  As C gets Rs.150,000 as his share, the share of A and B together is Rs.225,000.
  Therefore, a+b = 225000
  Also, a/40000 = (10/12) and b/60000 = (10/12)
  Solving these equations, we get a = 16666.67 and b = 25000.
  Therefore, a+b = 41666.67
  As C invested for (12-x) months, his share is (120000*(12-x))/100000*375000

  The formula is: sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms in the sequence, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

Using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers, we can set up an equation:

We can simplify this equation by multiplying both sides by 2:

102 = k * (-50 + last number)

We also know that the last number can be expressed as n + k - 1, since it is k numbers away from the first number.

Substituting n = -50, we get:

Simplifying:

102 = k * (-100 + k)

102 = -100k + k^2

Rearranging:

k^2 - 100k + 102 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for k:

k = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

  Hose A fills the pool alone in 8 hours, so its rate is:
  Rate of A = Work / Time = 1 / 8 = 1/8
  
  Hose A fills the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so its work is:
  Work of A = Rate x Time = (1/8) x 2 = 1/4
  
  The remaining work to fill the pool is:
  Remaining work = Total work - Work of A = 1 - 1/4 = 3/4
  
  Hose A and Hose B work together to fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, so their combined rate is:
  Combined rate of A and B = Work / Time = (3/4) / 3 = 1/4

  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5.
  Let's use Vieta's formulas to solve for m.
  Vieta's formulas state that for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, the sum of roots is -b/a and the product of roots is c/a.
  In this case, the sum of roots is 1.5 + r, where r is the other root of the equation.
  The product of roots is 1.5r + 22.
  We can set up two equations using Vieta's formulas.
  1.5 + r = -m/1
  1.5r + 22 = 22/m
  We want to solve for m, so let's solve the first equation for r.
  r = -1.5 - m
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
  1.5(-1.5 - m) + 22 = 22/m
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  -2.25 - 1.5m + 22 = 22/m
  -1.5m + 20.75 = 22/m
  Multiplying both sides by m, we get:
  -1.5m^2 + 20.75m - 22 = 0
  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for m.
  m = (-20.75 ± sqrt(20.75^2 - 4(-1.5)(-22))) / (2(-1.5))
  m = (-20.75 ± sqrt(574.25)) / (-3)
  m = (-20.75 ± 23.95) / (-3)
  m = 1.4 or m = -16.2

  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5.
  Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for the value of m.
  The quadratic formula is (-b ± sqrt(b^2-4ac)) / 2a
  In this equation, a = 1, b = m, and c = 22.
  We know that one of the roots is 1.5. Let's call the other root r.
  By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots is -b/a.
  Therefore, 1.5 + r = -m/1
  Simplifying, we get r = -m - 1.5
  Now, we can substitute the values of a, b, and c into the quadratic formula and solve for m.
  (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4(1)(22))) / 2(1) = (1.5, r)
  Using the root 1.5, we get:
  (-m + sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2 = 1.5
  Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
  -m + sqrt(m^2 - 88) = 3

To get the same remainder on dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, the difference between 2272 and 875 should also be divisible by N.
The difference between 2272 and 875 is 1397.
The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397 itself. So, the 3-digit number N is either 1 or 1397 or a factor of 1397.
The sum of the digits of N is:
  If N = 1, sum of the digits = 1
  If N = 1397, sum of the digits = 20
  If N is a factor of 1397, it cannot be less than 100 and cannot have a digit sum greater than 19.

Let's assume that the 3-digit number is ""abc"".
From the given information, we can write two equations:
  2272 = x * abc + r  (where x is a quotient and r is the remainder)
  875 = y * abc + r   (where y is a quotient and r is the same remainder as in the first equation)
By solving for r, we get:
  r = 2272 - x * abc 
  r = 875 - y * abc
  2272 - x * abc = 875 - y * abc
  (2272 - 875) = (x * abc - y * abc)
  1397 = (x - y) * abc
  abc = 1397 / (x - y)
abc is a 3-digit integer, which means that x - y can only be a factor of 1397 that is between 1 and 12 (because 1397 is a prime number).
We can calculate the sum of digits of all 3-digit factors of 1397:

To solve this problem, we need to use the ""Remainder Theorem"" which states that ""If a number is divided by N, then the remainder is the same as the remainder of the sum of its digits divided by N.""
We are given that 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder when divided by N.
Let's find the remainder when 2272 is divided by N. Let's call the remainder r.
So, 2272 = pN + r, where p is the quotient.
Similarly, 875 = qN + r, where q is the quotient.
Now, let's subtract the two equations. We get, 1397 = (p-q)N.
As N is a 3-digit number, it must be a factor of 1397. The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397 itself. Therefore, N can be 1 or 1397.
If N = 1, then the sum of its digits is 1.

To solve this problem we need to find the HCF of (2272-N) and (875-N) and the HCF will be the required remainder.
The HCF of (2272-N) and (875-N) can be found using Euclid's Algorithm. 
Then, we can find the sum of the digits of the HCF and that will be the answer.
Let's find the HCF of (2272-N) and (875-N):

2272 - N = N(2x5x2x2x2 + 1) + 0
875 - N = N(8x1x7 + 3) + 0

The remainders are 0, so the HCF will be the divisor N when it divides the difference between the two numbers.

2272 - N - (875 - N) = 1397
HCF(2272-N, 875-N) = HCF(1397, N)

The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397. The only 3-digit number that can divide 1397 is 17.

  Let's assume that the number of copper coins is x.
  Then, the number of brass coins would be (17-x), since the total number of coins is 17.
  The amount of money the coin-diver gets for bringing each copper coin is 20 cents.
  Therefore, the total amount of money she gets for x copper coins is 20x cents.
  Similarly, the amount of money the coin-diver gets for bringing each brass coin is 25 cents.
  Therefore, the total amount of money she gets for (17-x) brass coins is 25(17-x) cents.
  The total amount of money she gets for one dive is $3.40 or 340 cents.

    The number after subtracting 495 from abc is represented by cba.
    abc - 495 = cba
    100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
    Simplifying the above equation, we have:
    99a - 99c = 495
    a - c = 5            ---(3)
  To solve for the number, we can use equation (1) and (3) to get two variables in terms of the third.
  First, we can express c in terms of a from equation (3) as c = a - 5.
  Substituting c = a - 5 in equation (1), we have:
    a + b + a - 5 = 17
    2a + b = 22      ---(4)
  Next, we can express b in terms of a from equation (4) as b = 22 - 2a.
  Substituting b = 22 - 2a and c = a - 5 in equation (2), we have:
    a^2 + (22 - 2a)^2 + (a - 5)^2 = 109
    Simplifying the above equation, we get:

  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the relationships between the three categories of files: virus only (V), worm only (W), and both virus and worm (VW).
  Let's use n(V), n(W), and n(VW) to represent the number of files in each category.
  From the problem, we know that:
  - n(V) + n(W) - n(VW) = 250 (since all 250 files are infected by either a virus or a worm or both)
  - n(W) = 2.5 * n(VW) (since the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm)
  - n(Vc) = 0.5 * 250 = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, or equivalently, 50% were infected by a virus)
  We want to find n(Wc), the number of files that were not infected by a worm.
  We know that n(Wc) = 250 - n(W) - n(VWc), where n(VWc) is the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm and not infected by a worm.
  We can use the first two equations above to solve for n(VW):
  n(W) = 2.5 * n(VW)
  n(V) + n(W) - n(VW) = 250
  n(V) + 2.5 * n(VW) - n(VW) = 250
  n(V) + 1.5 * n(VW) = 250
  We can substitute n(V) = 125 into the equation above to solve for n(VW):
  125 + 1.5 * n(VW) = 250
  1.5 * n(VW) = 125
  n(VW) = 83.33 (rounded to two decimal places)
  Since n(VW) is not a whole number, we need to adjust our equations to work with whole numbers of files. One way to do this is to assume that there are 83 files infected by both a virus and a worm, and that the remaining 0.33 files are each infected by both a virus and a worm with probability 1/3. This gives us:
  - n(VW) = 83
  - n(W) = 2.5 * n(VW) = 208
  - n(VWc) = 0.33 * 2 = 1 (rounded up to the nearest whole number, since each of the 0.33 files is infected by both a virus and a worm with probability 1/3)
  - n(Wc) = 250 - n(W) - n(VWc) = 250 - 208 - 1 = 41

  Let's say ""V"" represents the number of files infected by a virus only, ""W"" represents the number of files infected by a worm only, and ""X"" represents the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  From the problem, we know that:
    - V + X = 0.5 * 250 (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
    - W = 2.5 * X
    - V + W + X = 250
  We can use these equations to solve for X, and then use that value to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm.
  
Calculations:
  V + X = 0.5 * 250  =>  V + X = 125
  W = 2.5 * X
  V + W + X = 250  =>  V + 2.5X + X = 250  =>  V + 3.5X = 250
  Substituting W = 2.5X into the third equation:
  V + W + X = 250  =>  V + 2.5X + X = 250  =>  V + 3.5X = 250
  V + X = 125  =>  V = 125 - X
  Substituting V = 125 - X into V + 3.5X = 250:
  125 - X + 3.5X = 250  =>  2.5X = 125  =>  X = 50
  Therefore, there are 50 files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
  The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times that, so W = 2.5 * 50 = 125.

- We know that V + W + B = 250 (the total number of files).
- We also know that W = 2.5B (the number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm).

  Let the number of files infected only by a worm be 2.5x, and let the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm be x.
  Therefore, the number of files infected only by a virus is (250 - 2.5x - x - 0.5(250 - x)) = (0.5x - 25).

  The number of files that were infected by a virus only or not infected by either a virus or a worm is (0.5x - 25) + (250 - x - 0.5(250 - x)) = (375 - x).
  Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is (250 - 2.5x - x - (375 - x)) = (250 - 1.5x).

  We know that there are 250 files in total, so:
  x + 2.5x + y = 250
  3.5x + y = 250
  We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so:
  y = 0.5(250) = 125
  Therefore, 3.5x + 125 = 250
  3.5x = 125
  x = 35.71 (rounded to two decimal places)
  We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm, so we need to subtract the number of files that were infected by a worm from the total number of files that were not infected by a virus:
  (250 - 125) - 2.5x = 125 - 2.5(35.71) = 31.07 (rounded to two decimal places)

- Let VW be the number of files infected by both virus and worm
- We know that V + W - VW = 250, which means that the total number of files infected by virus or worm is 250.
- We also know that W = 2.5 * VW, which means that the number of files infected only by worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both virus and worm.
- We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that V = 0.5 * (250 - V).
- We can solve for V and get V = 62.5, which means that 125 files were not infected by a virus.
- We can also solve for VW and get VW = 25, which means that W = 62.5.

  Let B be the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm.
  We know that V + W + B = 250.
  We also know that W = 2.5B.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which means that 50% of the files were either not infected at all or infected by a worm only.
  That means W + B + X = 125, where X is the number of files that were not infected at all.
  We can substitute W = 2.5B into the equation V + W + B = 250 to get V + 3.5B = 250.
  We can solve for B by subtracting V from both sides and dividing by 3.5 to get B = (250 - V) / 3.5.
  We can substitute W = 2.5B into the equation W + B + X = 125 to get (2.5B) + B + X = 125.
  We can substitute B = (250 - V) / 3.5 into the equation to get (2.5[(250 - V) / 3.5]) + [(250 - V) / 3.5] + X = 125.
  We can simplify this equation to get (7V - 1000) / 14 + X = 125.
  We know that X = 125 - W - B.
  We can substitute W = 2.5B and B = (250 - V) / 3.5 into the equation to get X = 125 - (2.5[(250 - V) / 3.5]) - [(250 - V) / 3.5].
  We can simplify this equation to get X = (1000 - 7V) / 14.
  We need to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, which is X + V. 
  We can substitute X = (1000 - 7V) / 14 into the equation to get X + V = (1000 - 6V) / 14.

  We know W = 2.5B.
  We also know that V + B + W = 250.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so V = 0.5(250) - B.
  Substituting the second equation into the third equation, we get 0.5(250) - B + B + 2.5B = 250.
  Simplifying, we get 3B = 125, so B = 125/3.
  Therefore, W = 2.5B = 2.5(125/3) = 104.2 (rounded to the nearest tenth).
  The number of files not infected by a worm is V + B.

  The length of the ribbon was originally 30 cm.
  It was reduced in the ratio 5:3.
  This means that the original length was divided into 5 + 3 = 8 parts.
  Each part is 30/8 = 3.75 cm.
  The reduction ratio is 5:3, which means that 5 parts were reduced to 3 parts.
  5 parts are equal to 5 x 3.75 = 18.75 cm.

  Since they both meet each other for the second time, their total time of travel is the same.
  Let T be the total time taken by both to meet each other for the second time.
  We know that distance = speed x time, which implies time = distance/speed.
  Allen covers distance d in time t1 and Bob covers distance d in time t2.
  Allen will cover distance d again in time T-t1 and Bob will cover distance d again in time T-t2.
  From the question, we know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Therefore, we can write:
  distance covered by Bob = distance covered by Allen + 48
  speed of Bob x time taken by Bob = speed of Allen x time taken by Allen + 48
  78 x t2 = 54 x t1 + 48
  Also, we know that the total distance covered by both is equal to 2d, which implies:
  distance covered by Allen + distance covered by Bob = 2d
  speed of Allen x time taken by Allen + speed of Bob x time taken by Bob = 2d
  54 x t1 + 78 x t2 = 2d

  If there were 64 lilies initially, then the number of lilies on the 60th day is 2^30 + 64.
  We can solve for the number of days it takes for the lilies to reach 2^30 + 64 using the same formula and setting it equal to 2^30 + 64.
  2^(number of days/2) = 2^30 + 64
  number of days/2 = log2(2^30 + 64)
  number of days = 2 * log2(2^30 + 64)

  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the growth rate is exponential.
  We can use the formula, P = P0 * 2^(t/k), where P is the final number of water lilies, P0 is the initial number of water lilies, t is the time it takes for the lake to be fully covered, and k is the doubling time in days.
  We know that P0 = 64, and k = 2.
  We need to solve for t when P = 2^n, where n is some integer.
  If it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from one water lily, then we have 2^30 = 1 * 2^(t/2), which simplifies to 2^(t/2) = 2^30.

  We can assume that the two trains meet at a point ""X"" between City A and City B.
  Let's calculate the time it takes for each train to reach point ""X"".
  Train M travels for 2 hours (from 5 am to 7 am) before Train N starts its journey.
  In 2 hours, Train M would have traveled (2/4) = 0.5 of the distance between City A and City B.
  Therefore, the distance between City A and point ""X"" is 0.5 of the distance between City A and City B.
  Similarly, Train N travels for 2.5 hours (from 7 am to 9:30 am) before meeting Train M.
  In 2.5 hours, Train N would have traveled (2.5/3.5) = 0.714 of the distance between City B and City A.
  Therefore, the distance between City B and point ""X"" is 0.714 of the distance between City B and City A.
  The total distance between City A and City B is the sum of the distance between City A and point ""X"" and the distance between City B and point ""X"".
  We can set up an equation using this information and solve for the time when the two trains meet.
  Let t be the time (in hours) when the two trains meet after Train N starts its journey.
  Distance traveled by Train M = Distance between City A and point ""X"" = 0.5 * Distance between City A and City B
  Distance traveled by Train N = Distance between City B and point ""X"" = 0.714 * Distance between City B and City A
  Total distance = Distance traveled by Train M + Distance traveled by Train N
  Total distance = 0.5 * Distance between City A and City B + 0.714 * Distance between City B and City A
  Total distance = 0.5 * D + 0.714 * D (where D is the distance between City A and City B)
  Total distance = 1.214 * D
  Speed of Train M = Distance traveled by Train M / Time taken by Train M = (0.5 * D) / 4
  Speed of Train N = Distance traveled by Train N / Time taken by Train N = (0.714 * D) / (3.5 + t)
  Total distance = Speed of Train M * t + Speed of Train N * t
  1.214 * D = (0.5 * D / 4) * t + (0.714 * D / (3.5 + t)) * t

  1.214 * D - 0.714 * D = 0.125 * D * t

  The two trains have been traveling towards each other for 2 hours (from 7am when train N departs to 9am when train M arrives at City B).
  Let's assume the two trains meet x hours after 7am.
  The distance covered by train N in x hours is d1 = (speed of N) x (time taken by N) = (d1/x) x x = d1.
  The distance covered by train M in (2+x) hours is d2 = (speed of M) x (time taken by M) = (d2/(2+x)) x (2+x) = d2.
  The sum of the distances covered by the two trains is the total distance between the two stations, which is a constant value.
  Therefore, d1 + d2 = constant.
  We know that d1 + d2 = (speed of N) x (time taken by N) + (speed of M) x (time taken by M).
  Solving for x gives us x = (d1 + d2) / (speed of N + speed of M).
  We can calculate d1 and d2 using the speeds of the two trains and the time they have been traveling.
  Then, we can substitute these values in the formula for x to get the time when the two trains cross each other.
Calculation:
  Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is 400 km (this is just an assumption and does not affect the answer).
  The speed of train M is 400/4 = 100 km/h.
  The speed of train N is 400/3.5 = 114.29 km/h.
  d1 = (114.29 km/h) x (x-2h)
  d2 = (100 km/h) x (x)
  d1 + d2 = 400 km
  (114.29 km/h)(x-2h) + (100 km/h)(x) = 400 km

  We can use the formula: Speed = Distance/Time.
  Let's assume the speed of train M is S1 and the speed of train N is S2.
  The distance traveled by train M in 4 hours = 4*S1.
  The distance traveled by train N in 3.5 hours = 3.5*S2.

  We can do this by removing a portion of the mixture and replacing it with pure sand.
  Let's assume that we need to remove x kg of the mixture.
  The amount of sand in the new mixture will be the same as the amount of clay.
  Therefore, the amount of sand in the new mixture will be 0.5(10-x) kg.

  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The area of the rectangular plot is lb.
  The area of the plot including the boundary is (l+2)(b+2).
  So, the area of the boundary is (l+2)(b+2) - lb.
  The area of 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is (l+2)(b+2) - lb.

  Let's assume Joe's age = J, Joe's sister's age = S, and Joe’s father's age = F.
  We can use the following equations:
    J + S + F = 100  ---(1)
    When Joe is as old as his father, then Joe’s sister will be twice as old as now.
    J + F = 2(S)    ---(2)
    When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
    J + F = 2(F-S)  ---(3)
  We can simplify equation (2) and (3) to get:
    S = (J + F) / 2 ---(4)
    F = 2S + J     ---(5)
    F = 2J - S     ---(6)
  We can substitute equation (4) into equation (1) to get:
    J + (J + F) / 2 + F = 100
    3J + 3F = 196
    J + F = 65.33  ---(7)
  We can substitute equation (5) and (6) into equation (7) to get:
    J + 2S + J = 65.33
    2J + 2S = 65.33
    J + S = 32.67   ---(8)
  We can substitute equation (4) into equation (8) to get:
    J + (J + F) / 2 = 32.67
    3J + F = 65.34
    F = 65.34 - 3J
  We know that Joe, his sister, and his father's age are all integers. Therefore, we can try different values of J until we find an integer value for F.
  Let's try J = 14, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(14) = 23.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 15, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(15) = 20.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 16, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(16) = 17.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 17, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(17) = 14.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 18, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(18) = 11.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 19, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(19) = 8.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 20, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(20) = 5.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 21, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(21) = 2.34 (not an integer)
  Let's try J = 22, then
    F = 65.34 - 3(22) = -0.66 (not a positive integer)

  Let's assume Joe's age is J, his sister's age is S, and his father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  When Joe is as old as his father, the age difference between them will be F - J. So, at that time, his sister's age will be S + (F - J) = 2S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father. Let's assume the age when Joe's sister was as old as her father was x years. So, at that time, the age difference between Joe's father and sister was F - x = 2(x - S).
  We have two equations and two variables. We can solve for J and F and find the age of Joe's father.

- From the first sentence, we can write: J + S + F = 100
- From the second sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his sister will be twice her current age. Let's call the age at which Joe is as old as his father x. At that time, Joe will be x years old and his father will be x years old as well. Joe's sister's age will be S + (x - J). We can write the equation: S + (x - J) = 2S
- From the third sentence, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice the age he was when his sister was as old as his father. Let's call the age at which Joe's sister was as old as his father y. At that time, Joe's sister's age was y - S, and his father's age was y. We can write the equation: x + y = 2(y - S) => x = 2S - y

- Now we have 3 equations with 3 unknowns:
  J + S + F = 100
  S + (x - J) = 2S
  x + y = 2(y - S)

- We can solve for J, S, and F:
  From the second equation: x = S + (S - y)
  Substituting into the third equation: S + (S - y) + y = 2(y - S) => S = y/3
  Substituting into the second equation: x = 4y/3 - J
  Substituting into the first equation: J + y/3 + F = 100 => J + F = 100 - y/3
  Substituting into the equation x = S + (S - y): 4y/3 - J = 2y/3 - y => J = y/3
  Substituting J = y/3 into J + F = 100 - y/3: F = 200/3 - y/3

  X = 2F - J
  Substituting the value of X in terms of F and J into the first equation, we get:

  If the total amount exchanged between them is zero, then the number of Tails flipped must be equal to the number of Heads flipped.
  Let x be the number of Heads flipped.
  Then, the number of Tails flipped is 20 - x.
  The total amount exchanged between them is (2 dollars per Head)x - (3 dollars per Tail)(20-x).

  On his way back, Kevin drove for the same distance d, but at a faster speed of 90 mph.
  Let's call the time it took him to reach point A from point B ""x"".
  Therefore, d = 90x (Equation 2)
  We know that Kevin was still 70 miles away from point B 3 hours before the end of his trip.

  Substituting these values into Equation 3, we get:

  Let's assume the 5 digit number is abcde.
  According to the problem, the number with a 1 after it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
  If we add a 1 after the number, the new number is abcde1 and according to the problem, it should be three times as large as the number with a 1 before it which is 1abcde.
  Therefore, we can write the equation: 10abcde + 1 = 3(100000 + abcde)
  Simplifying the equation, we get: 7abcde = 299999
  Dividing both sides by 7, we get: abcde = 42857

  Let the 5 digit number be 'abcde'.
  Then, the number with a 1 after it is 'abcde1'.
  And, the number with a 1 before it is '1abcde'.
  As per the problem,
  abcde1 = 3 x 1abcde
  => abcde1 = 3 x (10000 x a + 1000 x b + 100 x c + 10 x d + e)
  => abcde1 = 30000 x a + 3000 x b + 300 x c + 30 x d + 3 x e
  => abcde1 = 3 x (10000 x 1 + 1000 x a + 100 x b + 10 x c + d)  (as per the problem)
  => abcde1 = 30000 + 3000 x a + 300 x b + 30 x c + 3 x d
  => abcde = 10000 + 1000 x a + 100 x b + 10 x c + d
  From the above equations, we can see that 'e' has no impact on the value of the number.
  Therefore, we can try to solve for 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd' by substituting some values for 'e'.
  For example, if we take 'e' as 0, then we can simplify the equations as follows:
  abcde1 = 3 x 1abcde
  => abcde1 = 3 x (10000 x a + 1000 x b + 100 x c + 10 x d)
  => abcde1 = 30000 x a + 3000 x b + 300 x c + 30 x d
  => abcde = 10000 + 1000 x a + 100 x b + 10 x c + d
  Let's try to solve the above equations for 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd'.
  From the first two equations, we can see that:
  3d = e
  3c + carry = d
  3b + carry = c
  3a + carry = b
  3 x 1 + carry = a
  Solving the above equations, we get:
  a = 4
  b = 2
  c = 8
  d = 5
  e = 3
  Therefore, the 5 digit number is 42853.
  Let's check if it satisfies the given condition:
  With a 1 after it, the number becomes 428531, which is indeed three times as large as the number with a 1 before it, which is 142853.
  Hence, the answer is A: 42857.

  If the number is ABCDE, then with a 1 after it, the number is ABCDE1 and with a 1 before it, it is 1ABCDE.
  The property states that ABCDE1 = 3 x 1ABCDE.
  We can write this as ABCDE1 = 3 x (10000 x 1 + A x 1000 + B x 100 + C x 10 + D) + 1.
  Simplifying this, we get ABCDE1 = 30001 + 3000A + 300B + 30C + 3D.
  We can also write ABCDE1 as 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + 1.
  Equating these two, we get 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + 1 = 30001 + 3000A + 300B + 30C + 3D.
  Simplifying this, we get 70000A + 7000B + 700C + 70D + 7E = 30000.
  We know that the number is a 5 digit number, so A cannot be 0.
  We can try different values of A and check if any of them satisfy this equation.
  If we take A = 4, then the left-hand side becomes 7 x (40000 + 4000 + 400 + 4) + E = 282004 + E.
  The right-hand side is 30000.
  Therefore, E should be 6 for the equation to hold.

  Let's call the number we are looking for ""x"".
  If the student found 7/18 of the number, we can represent it as (7/18)*x.
  If the actual value of 7/8 of the number is (7/8)*x, then we know that the difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770.
  We can set up an equation: (7/8)*x - (7/18)*x = 770
  Simplifying the equation, we get: (49/72)*x = 770
  Solving for x, we get: x = (770*72)/49 = 1120
  Therefore, the number we are looking for is 1120.

  Let the number be x.
  7/8 of the number = 7x/8
  7/18 of the number = 7x/18
  The student found the value of 7x/18 instead of 7x/8
  Actual value - Student value = 770
  7x/8 - 7x/18 = 770
  LCM of 8 and 18 is 72
  (63x - 28x)/72 = 770
  35x/72 = 770
  x = 1584

  Let's assume the number be x.
  The student found the value of 7/18 of the number, so the student found (7/18)x.
  The actual value of 7/8 of the number is (7/8)x.
  The difference between the student's answer and the actual answer is 770.
  Therefore, (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770.
  Solving the above equation will give us the value of x.
  (7/8)x - (7/18)x = 770
  77x/72 - 14x/72 = 770
  63x/72 = 770
  x = (72*770)/63
  x = 880
  Therefore, the required number is 880.
  The answer is not in the options. 
  Let's calculate 7/8 of 880, which is (7/8)*880 = 770.
  Therefore, the answer is E: None of the above.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile, which means it will take $3.50 to travel the first quarter-mile.
  After that, the cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter-mile.
  We can set up an equation to represent the total cost of the cab ride based on the distance traveled:
  Cost = 3.50 + 0.10(d-0.25)
  where d is the distance traveled in miles.
  We want to find the maximum distance that can be traveled with $8.50.
  We can substitute $8.50 for Cost and solve for d.
  8.50 = 3.50 + 0.10(d-0.25)
  5 = 0.10(d-0.25)
  50 = d-0.25
  d = 50.25
  Therefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled with $8.50 is 50.25 quarter-miles, or 12.5625 miles.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile.
  The cab charges 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  We have $8.50 to spend.
  We need to find the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50.
  Let's use algebra:
  
  - Let x be the number of additional quarter miles we can travel with $8.50.
  - The cost of x additional quarter miles is 10x cents or 0.1x dollars.
  - The total cost of the cab ride is 3.50 dollars + 0.1x dollars.
  - We want to find the maximum value of x such that the total cost is less than or equal to 8.50 dollars.
  - We can write this as an inequality: 3.50 + 0.1x ≤ 8.50
  - Solving for x, we get x ≤ 50.
  - We round down to the nearest multiple of 4 (since there are 4 quarter-miles in a mile), which is 48.
  - Therefore, we can travel up to 12 miles (48 quarter-miles) with $8.50.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  We need to find how many quarter miles we can travel with $8.50.
  Let's start by calculating how many quarter miles we can travel with $5.00 (which is $8.50 - $3.50).
  $5.00 / $0.10 = 50 quarter-miles.
  However, we need to add the first quarter-mile that costs $3.50.
  Therefore, we can travel 51 quarter-miles with $8.50.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's denote the maximum distance that can be traveled by ""d"".
  The cost of the first quarter-mile is $3.50.
  The remaining distance is d-0.25.
  The cost of each additional quarter mile is $0.10.
  The cost of traveling d-0.25 miles is $8.50-$3.50=$5.
  The cost of each additional quarter mile is $0.10.
  Therefore, the cost of traveling (d-0.25) miles is $5/0.10=50.
  The total cost of traveling d miles is $3.50+$5+$0.10*(4*[(d-0.25)/0.25])=$3.50+$5+$0.10*(4*[d-1])=8.50+0.40*[d-1].
  We want to maximize the distance d, such that 8.50+0.40*[d-1] <= 8.50.

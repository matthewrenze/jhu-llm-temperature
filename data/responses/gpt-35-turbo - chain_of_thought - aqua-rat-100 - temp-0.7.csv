- For a given pair (x, y), we need to check if:
  - x is a random number between 0 and 100 inclusive
  - y is less than or equal to the square root of x.
- If both conditions are true, then the pair satisfies the routine, otherwise, it does not.
- Let's check each of the given pairs:
  - (99, 10): 99 is between 0 and 100, and 10 is less than the square root of 99 (which is approximately 9.95). So, this pair satisfies the routine.
  - (85, 9): 85 is between 0 and 100, and 9 is less than the square root of 85 (which is approximately 9.22). So, this pair satisfies the routine.
  - (50, 7): 50 is between 0 and 100, and 7 is less than the square root of 50 (which is approximately 7.07). So, this pair satisfies the routine.
  - (1, 1): 1 is between 0 and 100, and 1 is equal to the square root of 1. So, this pair satisfies the routine.

40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 out of 100.
20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 out of 100.
We can use this information to determine how many employees take only a winter vacation, only a summer vacation or both a winter and a summer vacation.
The percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is (75 - 40) = 35%.
The percentage of employees who take only a summer vacation is (40 - 20) = 20%.
Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (20% - Q).
We can now set up an equation to solve for Q:
100% = 35% + 20% + Q + 40% + 5%

  Let's assume that x% of the employees take only a winter vacation.

  We know that 75% take a winter vacation, so the percentage of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation is (75 - x)%.
  We also know that 20% take neither vacation, so the percentage of employees who take no vacation is 20%.

  The speed of the train is 120 miles per hour which is equal to 176 feet per second. 
  To pass through the tunnel completely, the train will have to cover the length of the tunnel which is 5280 feet.
  To calculate the required time, we need to divide the length of the tunnel by the speed of the train.
  Time = (Length of tunnel) / (Speed of train)
  Time = 5280 / 176
  Time = 30 seconds (rounded off to the nearest second)
  Therefore, it will take 30 seconds for the express train to pass completely through the tunnel.

  The train takes three seconds to enter the tunnel.
  The train's length plus the tunnel's length equals one mile.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to calculate how long it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  Let's first calculate the length of the train.
  We know the speed of the train and the time it takes to enter the tunnel, so we can calculate the distance it travels in that time.
  120 miles/hour = 2 miles/minute = 0.033 miles/second
  The train covers 0.033 miles/second * 3 seconds = 0.099 miles to enter the tunnel.
  Therefore, the length of the train is 1 mile - 0.099 miles = 0.901 miles
  Now, we need to calculate how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles/hour, which is 1.6 miles/minute, or 0.027 miles/second.
  We need to cover a distance of 1 mile + 0.901 miles = 1.901 miles.
  Time = Distance / Speed = 1.901 miles / 0.027 miles/second = 70.4 seconds.

  The tunnel is 1 mile long.
  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.
  We need to find how long it takes for the entire train to pass through the tunnel.
  The train is traveling at a speed of 120 miles per hour.
  First, we need to convert the speed to miles per second.
  120 miles/hour = 2 miles/minute = 1/30 mile/second
  Since the train is 1 mile long, it will take 1/30 * 1 hour = 2 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel after it has entered it.
  However, it has already taken 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so the total time it takes to pass through the tunnel is 3 + 2 = 5 seconds.

  The total length of fencing needed is x+y+x+y-10 = 2x + 2y - 10.
  We can solve for y in xy = 240 to get y = 240/x.
  Substituting y into the expression for the total length of fencing needed, we get 2x + 2(240/x) - 10.

  We can solve for y in terms of x using the area equation: y = 240/x.

  The rectangular yard has an area of 240 sq.meters.
  Let the length of the rectangular yard be ""l"" and the width be ""w"".
  From the problem, we have two equations:
    l * w = 240  ---(1)
    2l + w = perimeter - 10  ---(2)
  We want to find the perimeter of the fence, which is 2l + 2w.
  We can solve for ""w"" in equation (1) and substitute into equation (2) to get an equation in terms of ""l"" only.
  We can then solve for ""l"" and use it to find the perimeter of the fence.

  Let's assume the dimensions of the rectangular yard are length (l) and width (w).
  We know that the area of the yard is 240 square meters, so:
  l * w = 240
  We also know that Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of the rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced.
  This means that the length of the yard will be fenced on both sides and the width will be fenced on one side. The fourth side of the yard, which is already fenced by Alice's house, won't need a fence.
  The length of the fencing needed will be l + l + w = 2l + w.
  From the problem, we know that w = 240/l.
  We also know that one side of the yard of 10 meters is already fenced.
  Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is 2l + w + 10.
  We need to substitute the value of w in the second equation using the first equation.
  From the first equation, we get w = 240/l.
  Substituting w in the second equation, we get the total length of fencing needed as:
  2l + 240/l + 10.
  We need to find the value of l that minimizes the total length of fencing needed.
  To do this, we can differentiate the expression with respect to l and equate it to zero.
  Differentiating the expression, we get:
  2 - 240/l^2 = 0
  Solving for l, we get l = sqrt(120).
  Substituting this value of l in the expression for the total length of fencing needed, we get:
  2l + 240/l + 10 = 2sqrt(120) + 240/sqrt(120) + 10 = 2sqrt(120) + 20sqrt(3) + 10 ≈ 70.88.
  Rounding this value to the nearest integer, we get 71 meters of fencing needed.

  If the area of the rectangular yard is 240 square meters, we can find the length of the fourth side by dividing the area by the length of the three sides.
  Let's call the unknown length ""x"".
  Then, we know that (10 + x) * x = 240.
  Simplifying the equation, we get x^2 + 10x - 240 = 0.
  Factoring the equation, we get (x + 20) * (x - 12) = 0.
  Since the length of a side cannot be negative, we know that x = 12 meters.
  Therefore, the total length of fencing Alice needs is 2 * (10 + 12) + 12 = 56 meters.

  The dog ate 1/3 of the remaining dog food in the bowl at each feeding session.
  The dog started to eat at 8:00 am and ate once an hour until noon.
  The dog had 4 feeding sessions in total.
  Let x be the original amount of food in the bowl.
  At the first feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of x and 2/3 of x was remaining.
  At the second feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of (2/3)x, which is (2/9)x. Therefore, (4/9)x was remaining.
  At the third feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of (4/9)x, which is (4/27)x. Therefore, (8/27)x was remaining.

  We can find how many red sweets are there by setting up a proportion:
  4/7 = 120/x
  Cross-multiplying, we get
  4x = 120*7
  x = (120*7)/4
  x = 210

  The ratio of Red to Green sweets is 3:4.
  This means that for every 4 parts of Green sweets, there are 3 parts of Red sweets.
  If the number of Green sweets is 120, then we need to determine the number of Red sweets.
  We can start by finding the value of 1 part of Green sweets.
  4 parts of Green sweets = 120
  Therefore, 1 part of Green sweets = 120 / 4 = 30
  Now that we know the value of 1 part of Green sweets, we can find the value of 1 part of Red sweets.
  1 part of Red sweets = (3/4) * 30 = 22.5
  However, we cannot have half a sweet, so we need to round up to the nearest whole number.
  Therefore, the number of Red sweets is 23 * 3 = 69.

Let x be the number of friends who attended the picnic.
The total amount of money spent at the picnic is Rs. 96.
If 4 friends didn't turn up, then the remaining friends are (x-4).
Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
So, the total amount contributed by (x-4) friends is (96+4(x-4)).
The total amount contributed by (x-4) friends is also equal to (x * y), where y is the amount contributed by each friend. 
So, we can create an equation: (96+4(x-4)) = xy.
Now we can solve for x by trying each of the answer choices until we find the one that satisfies the equation.

Let's try answer choice A:
If 8 friends attended the picnic, then the total amount contributed is (8 * y).
The amount contributed by (8-4) = 4 friends who turned up is (4y+16).
So, we can create an equation: 96 + 4(8-4) = 8y + 16
Solving the equation, we get 8y = 84.
This is not possible because y is a positive integer.
Therefore, we can reject answer choice A.

Let's try answer choice B:
If 12 friends attended the picnic, then the total amount contributed is (12 * y).
The amount contributed by (12-4) = 8 friends who turned up is (8y+32).

  The second car is traveling faster than the first car.
  We can find the relative speed of the second car to the first car by subtracting their speeds: 52 mph - 55 mph = -3 mph
  The two cars are moving in the same direction, so we can find the distance between them by subtracting their positions.
  Since the second car is catching up to the first car, we can say that the distance between the two cars is decreasing by 3 miles every hour.
  To find how much time it will take for the cars to be 15 miles apart, we need to divide the distance of 15 miles by the relative speed of -3 mph: 15 miles / (-3 mph) = -5 hours.

  Let's first try to simplify the expressions and see if that helps us.
  [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Therefore, [x] ≤ x.
  [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y. Therefore, [y] ≤ y.
  [x + y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to (x + y). Therefore, [x + y] ≤ (x + y).
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ 2x + 2y
  Also, [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x. Therefore, [2x] ≤ 2x.
  [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y. Therefore, [2y] ≤ 2y.

  Let's now look at the choices:
  A: If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Therefore, 2x + 2y ≤ [x] + x + [y] + y + [x + y] < 2x + 2y + 3
  This is not possible because 2x + 2y is an integer and there is no integer between 2x + 2y and 2x + 2y + 3.

  B: If L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y), then either L(x,y) < R(x,y) or L(x,y) > R(x,y).
  Therefore, B is true.
  C: If L(x,y) < R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y].
  Therefore, 2x + 2y > [x] + x + [y] + y + [x + y] ≥ 2x + 2y - 2

  Profit Percentage (P) = (Profit/Cost Price)*100
  Cost Price = (100/P)*Profit
  Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
  Substituting the values, we get the selling price (with 5% discount) as 95/80 times the cost price.
  Therefore, (95/80)*((100/25)*Profit) = M
  M = Rs. 760
  Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 760.

If the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he sells the watch for 0.95x. 
If the shopkeeper gives a 7% discount, he sells the watch for 0.93x. 
We know that the profit earned with a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than the profit earned with a 5% discount. Therefore, we can write the equation:

To solve the problem, we can use the following steps:
Let MP = the marked price of the watch
Let CP = the cost price of the watch
Let SP = the selling price of the watch

Given that the shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, this means that the selling price is 95% of the marked price.
Thus, we have: SP = 0.95MP

If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, this means that the selling price is 93% of the marked price.
Thus, we have: SP = 0.93MP

We are also given that the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less as profit when he gives a discount of 7%.
This means that his profit when he gives a discount of 7% is Rs. (x - 15), where x is his profit when he gives a discount of 5%.

We know that profit (P) = SP - CP
Thus, we have: x - 15 = 0.93MP - CP
and x = 0.95MP - CP

Substituting x from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
0.95MP - CP - 15 = 0.93MP - CP
0.02MP = 15
MP = 750

Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

  Let the marked price of the watch be x.
  The selling price of the watch after a 5% discount is 0.95x.
  The selling price of the watch after a 7% discount is 0.93x.
  The profit earned after giving a 5% discount is (0.95x - cost price).
  The profit earned after giving a 7% discount is (0.93x - cost price - 15).
  Since the profit earned after giving a 7% discount is Rs. 15 less than the profit earned after giving a 5% discount, we can write the following equation: 0.93x - cost price - 15 = 0.95x - cost price - 15 + 15
  By simplifying the above equation, we get cost price = 0.02x - 150.
  The selling price after a 5% discount is (0.95x), which is equal to the cost price plus the profit earned. Therefore, 0.95x = cost price + profit = (0.02x - 150) + 0.05x.

Let's assume the marked price is M.
When the shopkeeper gave a discount of 5%, he earned a profit, which means he sold the watch for more than the cost price.
After that, when the shopkeeper gave a discount of 7%, he earned Rs. 15 less as profit, which means the selling price was Rs. 15 less than the previous selling price.
Let's calculate the selling price after giving a discount of 5%.
The selling price with a 5% discount = M - (5/100)M = 0.95M
Let's calculate the selling price after giving a discount of 7%.
The selling price with a 7% discount = M - (7/100)M = 0.93M
The difference between the selling prices with a 5% and 7% discount is Rs. 15.

  The cost of covering the four walls with paper would be (10xy - 4x^2) * 2 * 0.5 = 10xy - 4x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows would be 10xy - 4x^2 - 15.

  Given that the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m., we can write the equation as:

  2x = 2y
  x = y
  Now, substituting the value of 'y' in the equation '10xy + bx = 70', we get:

Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter of the room is 5x.
Let's also assume that the breadth and length of the room are b and l respectively.
Then the area of the four walls of the room = 2x(2b + l) = 4bx + 2lx.
The cost of papering 1 sq.m = Rs. 2/50 = Rs. 0.04.
Therefore, the cost of papering 4bx + 2lx = Rs. (4bx + 2lx) × 0.04 = Rs. 0.16bx + 0.08lx.
The area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m
The area of the remaining walls = 4bx + 2lx - 15.
The area of the remaining walls/h is equal to the semi-perimeter of the room.
Therefore, (4bx + 2lx - 15)/2x = 5x.
Solving the above equation, we get 2b + l - 15/2x = 5.
Solving for l, we get l = 10x - 2b - 15/2.
We know that area = length × breadth.
Therefore, area = l × b = (10x - 2b - 15/2) × b.
We also know that the area of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
Therefore, area = 2/5 × semi-perimeter × height.
Substituting the values of semi-perimeter and height, we get (10x - 2b - 15/2) × b = 2/5 × 5x × 2x.
Simplifying the above equation, we get 20bx - 4b² - 15b/2 = 20x²/5.
Multiplying the above equation by 10, we get 200bx - 20b² - 15b = 40x².

Option A: If the height of the room is 2.6m, then the semi-perimeter of the room is 5x = 13m. The area of the room is (2/5) × 13 × 2.6 = 10.4 sq.m. The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the remaining walls is negative. This option can be eliminated.
Option B: If the height of the room is 3.9m, then the semi-perimeter of the room is 5x = 19.5m. The area of the room is (2/5) × 19.5 × 3.9 = 15.18 sq.m. The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the remaining walls is 0.18 sq.m. The length of the room is (10x - 2b - 15/2) = (10 × 3.9 - 2b - 15/2) = 39 - 2b - 7.5. Solving for b, we get b = 6.75/2.

  We need to find the height of the room.
  We are given that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 2(5x)/(2x) = 5 times the height of the room.
  Let the height of the room be h and the length be 5h.
  We are given that the cost of papering the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering the walls is the product of the perimeter of the room and the cost per meter.
  The perimeter of the room is (2h + 2(5h)) = 12h, and the cost per meter is Rs.2.
  So, 12h x 2 = Rs.24h is the cost of papering the walls.
  We are also given that an area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows.
  The area of the room is (5h x h) = 5h^2 sq.m.
  So, the area of the walls is (5h^2 - 15) sq.m.
  We know that the width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m.
  Therefore, the length of paper needed to cover the walls is (5h^2 - 15)/(0.5) = 10(5h^2 - 15) meters.
  We are given that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  Therefore, we have: 24h + 10(5h^2 - 15) x 2 = 260
  Simplifying the equation, we get: 5h^2 - 12h - 23 = 0
  Solving this quadratic equation, we get: h = 4m or h = -1.15m
  Since the height of the room cannot be negative, the height of the room is 4m.
  Therefore, the answer is C: 4m.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and its semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Total area of the walls = semi-perimeter x height = 5x * 2x = 10x^2
  Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
  Area of the walls to be papered = Total area of walls - Area of doors and windows
  Let the width of the room be y.
  Length of the room = semi-perimeter/2 = 5x/2
  Therefore, 2x * 5x/2 - 15 = 10x^2 - 15 = y * length of the room
  Total cost of papering = cost per unit area * area
  cost per unit area = Rs.2/m = Rs.0.02/cm
  area = (length of the room + height of the room) * perimeter of the room
  perimeter of the room = semi-perimeter * 2 = 5x * 2 = 10x
  length of the room = area of walls to be papered / width of paper
  area of walls to be papered = 10x^2 - 15
  width of paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m
  height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  Therefore, x/(5x/2) = 2/5. Solving the equation, x = 1m.
  Putting value of x in 10x^2 - 15 = 85.
  area = (length of the room + height of the room) * perimeter of the room = (2x + 5x) * 10x = 70x^2
  cost = 0.02 * 70x^2 * 10000 = Rs. 14000x^2
  cost = Rs. 260

  Let's assume the height of the room is 'h'.
  Let the length and breadth of the room be 'l' and 'b' respectively.
  The semi-perimeter of the room will be (l+b)/2.
  According to the question, h/((l+b)/2) = 2/5.
  Solving for (l+b)/2, we get (l+b)/2 = 5h/2.
  Now, let's calculate the area of the four walls of the room.
  Area of the four walls = Perimeter of the room * height
  Perimeter of the room = 2(l+b)
  Area of the four walls = 2(l+b)*h
  Cost of papering = Area to be papered * Cost per sq.meter
  Area to be papered = Area of the four walls - Area of doors and windows
  Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, Area to be papered = 2(l+b)*h - 15
  Cost of papering = (2(l+b)*h - 15) * 2/100
  Now, the values given in the question can be used to form a system of equations which can be solved to get the value of 'h'.

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (5x/2)*2x + (9x/2)*2x = 28x^2/2 = 14x^2.
  The area of doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So, the area of the four walls that need to be papered is 14x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. So, we can find the cost of papering 1 square meter as 260/(14x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50 cm = 0.5 m and the cost of 1 meter of paper is Rs.2. Therefore, the cost of papering 1 square meter is Rs.4.
  Equating the two expressions for the cost of papering 1 square meter:
  260/(14x^2 - 15) = 4
  Solving this equation, we get x = 1.5.

  Let x and y be the two numbers.
  From the problem, we know that x^2 - y^2 = 256000 and x + y = 1000.
  We can factor x^2 - y^2 = (x + y)(x - y), which gives (x + y)(x - y) = 256000.
  We also know that x + y = 1000.
  We can solve for x - y by dividing both sides of the first equation by x + y, which gives x - y = 256000 / (x + y).
  We can now solve for x and y by adding and subtracting the equations x + y = 1000 and x - y = 256000 / (x + y).
  Adding the two equations gives 2x = 1000 + 256000 / (x + y), and subtracting the two equations gives 2y = 1000 - 256000 / (x + y).
  We can now solve for x and y by plugging in x + y = 1000 into the above equations and solving for x and y.
  After doing the necessary calculations, we get x = 640 and y = 360.

  Let's assume the sales person makes ""x"" sales.
  The commission percentage is 10% which means the sales person will earn 0.1*250 = $25 for each sale.
  The sales person wants to make at least $1000 as salary. Therefore, the total amount of money he should make is $1000.
  The total amount of money he makes is the sum of the money he makes from each sale. Therefore, the equation to solve is:

  We can write M as 100a + 10b + c and N as 100c + 10b + a. 
  Given M > N, we know a > c.
  Also, M - N can be written as 99(a-c) + 9(b-c) which is a multiple of 9.
  Therefore, 396c = 9k (where k is an integer) and c = 3k.
  Substituting the value of c in M and N, we get M = 100a + 10b + 3k and N = 100(3k) + 10b + a = 301a + 10b.
  Therefore, M - N = 99a - 298k.
  Substituting the values of M - N and c in the given equation, we get 99a - 298k + 1188k = 990.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a + 890k = 990.
  Since a > c, we know that a >= 4 and a <= 9.
  If a = 9, then k = 1. Therefore, M = 900 + 10b + 3 and N = 301*9 + 10b = 2710 + 10b.
  Therefore, M - N = 900 - 2710 + 10b + 3 = -1807 + 10b.
  We need to find the values of M where M - N > 0 and M > 300.
  Therefore, we get 900 - 2710 + 10b + 3 > 0 and 900 + 10b + 3 > 300.
  Solving the above inequalities, we get b > 180 and b > 29.
  Therefore, b > 180.
  Since b is a digit, the maximum value of b can be 9.
  Therefore, the number of values of M that are more than 300 is 190 - 299 = 21.

  M is a three digit number, so a cannot be zero.
  We know that M > N, so a > c.
  M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to 99(a-c) + 396c = 990.
  We can simplify the equation further to 4(a-c) + 16c = 10.
  From the equation above, 4(a-c) is even, so 16c must be even as well.
  Since c is a digit, the only possible even value for c is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.
  If c = 0, then a = 1, 2, 3, or 4. This gives us 4 values of M > 300.

  M - N can be written as 99(a-c) + 9(b-c)
  Substituting the values of M - N and c in the equation M - N + 396c = 990 we get:
  99(a-c) + 9(b-c) + 396c = 990
  Simplifying the above equation, we get
  99a + 9b - 297c = 891
  Dividing the above equation by 9, we get
  11a + b - 33c = 99
  We know that a > c, so minimum value of a is 2 and maximum value of a is 9.
  If we take a = 2, then b - 33c = 77, which gives us 9 values of b and c each.
  If we take a = 3, then b - 33c = 66, which gives us 8 values of b and c each.

  We know that M > N and M - N + 396c = 990.
  We can rewrite M as M = 100a + 10b + c and N as N = 100c + 10b + a.
  Therefore, M - N = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c) > 0 (since M > N)
  This implies that a > c.
  Also, M - N + 396c = 990 can be simplified to 99(a - c) + 396c = 990.
  This can be further simplified to 3(a - c) + 12c = 30.
  Dividing both sides by 3, we get a - c + 4c = 10.
  This gives us a = 10 - 3c.
  Since M is a three-digit number, we know that a cannot be 0.
  So, the only possible values of c are 1, 2, 3 and the corresponding values of a are 7, 4, 1 respectively.
  Therefore, we can form three-digit numbers M using the possible values of a, b and c.
  We need to count the number of values of M that are greater than 300.
  There are 3 possible values of a: 7, 4, 1.
  If a = 7, then b can take any value from 0 to 9 and c can take any value from 1 to 6.

  If a = 1, then b can take any value from 0 to 9 and c can take any value from 1 to 1.

  Let A's time period be x months. So, B's time period will be (12 - 2) = 10 months.
  As C gets Rs.150,000, the remaining amount of profit is Rs.(375,000 - 150,000) = Rs.225,000.
  So, the ratio of the profit shares of A, B, and C is 4:6:15, respectively.
  Let the time period of C be y months. Thus, the time period of C will be (12 - x - 10) = (2 - x + y) months.
  Using the ratio of profit shares, we can write the following equation: (40000 * x * 4) : (60000 * 10 * 6) : (120000 * (2 - x + y) * 15) = 4 : 6 : 15.
  Solving this equation, we get 3x - 5y = 6.
  As x and y are both integers, we can try different values of x and y that satisfy this equation until we get the value of y that is equal to or greater than 0.

  The ratio of their investments is 4:6:12 or 1:1.5:3

  C's share is 150,000. So, the total profit for 15 parts (1+1.5+3) = Rs.375,000
  The share of 1 part = Rs.375,000 / 15 = Rs.25,000
  So, C's investment = 3 parts, therefore his investment = 3 * Rs.25,000 = Rs.75,000
  C invested Rs.120,000 in total, so, he invested Rs.120,000 - Rs.75,000 = Rs.45,000 after B joined the business.
  B joined with Rs.60,000 after 2 months.

  Equating S to 51, we get (k/2) * (-k - 98) = 51.
  Simplifying this equation, we get -k^2 - 98k - 102 = 0.
  We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which gives us k = (98 +/- sqrt(98^2 - 4(-1)(-102))) / (-2).
  Since k has to be a positive integer, we can discard the negative root and get k = (98 + sqrt(10004)) / 2 = (98 + 100) / 2 = 99 / 2.
  Since k has to be an integer, we can conclude that k = 99 / 2 is not valid, and we need to round it up to the nearest integer, which is 50.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 40.

  Let's assume the least integer is x.
  Since all the integers are consecutive, the next integer is (x + 1), then (x + 2) and so on.
  Therefore, we can write the sum of the k consecutive integers as kx + [(k-1)k]/2.
  We know that the least integer is -50, so x = -50.

  The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height.
  Let's assume that the base of each triangle is b and the height of each triangle is h.

  (1/2) * b * h = 70
  b * h = 140

  b^2 + h^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
  b^2 + h^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  We can solve for b^2 by using the formula b^2 = (140/h).
  Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
  (140/h) + h^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  h^3 - 2x^2h + 8xh - 140 = 0
  We know that h = 10 feet, since h^2 = 70 / (1/2 * b) and 1/2 * b is a positive number.
  Solving for x using this value of h, we get:
  h^2 + (x-4)^2 = x^2
  x^2 - 8x + 36 = 0
  (x-6)(x-2) = 0

  Let's assume the original side of the square piece of cloth is x feet.
  After trimming 4 feet from one side, the new dimensions of the rectangular piece are (x-4) by x.
  The rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles.
  The area of each triangle is given as 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is given by the formula (1/2)*base*height.
  We know the area and can find the height of the triangle.
  (1/2)*(x-4)*height = 70
  height = (140 / (x-4))
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is given by 4 times the length of its sides.
  The perimeter of the square piece of cloth is (4 * x) feet.
  We need to find the value of x.
  We know that the height of the triangle is (140 / (x-4)).
  The length of the base of the triangle is x.
  We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse of the triangle.
  Hypotenuse^2 = (x^2) + ((140/(x-4))^2)
  We know that the area of the triangle is 70 square feet.
  (1/2)*x*(140/(x-4)) = 70
  x*(140/(x-4)) = 140
  x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0
  (x-14)*(x+10) = 0
  x = 14 (since x cannot be negative)

  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet, so the total area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet.
  Let's say the original side length of the square piece of cloth was x.
  When 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, the rectangular piece has dimensions x-4 and x+4.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (x-4)(x+4) = x^2 - 16.
  We know that x^2 - 16 = 140, so x^2 = 156.
  Therefore, x = sqrt(156) which is approximately 12.49 feet.

  The original square cloth has four equal sides.
  If 4 feet is trimmed from one edge, then the new shape of the cloth will be a rectangle.
  Let 'x' be the original length of one side of the square piece of cloth.
  The new shape of the cloth will have dimensions (x-4) by x.
  The area of a triangle is (1/2) x base x height.
  Each triangle has an area of 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is also equal to half the area of the rectangle formed by the two triangles.
  Therefore, (1/2) x (x-4) x x = 2 x 70 = 140.
  Simplifying this equation, we get: x^2 - 4x - 280 = 0.
  Factoring this quadratic equation, we get: (x-20)(x+14) = 0.
  Since the length of a side of a square cannot be negative, the only possible value for x is 20.

  We already know that l + w = 28, and we can simplify this formula to: 784 = l^2 + 2lw + w^2.

  We can use the fact that (l - w)^2 >= 0, which can be simplified to l^2 + w^2 >= 2lw.
  Therefore, 784 = l^2 + 2lw + w^2 >= 3lw, or lw <= 784/3.

  Hose B can fill x/3 of the pool in 1 hour.
  Together, Hose A and Hose B can fill 1/8 + x/3 of the pool in 1 hour.
  Hose A and Hose B filled 3/8 of the pool in 3 hours working together, so:

  Let's assume the pool's capacity is 1. 
  In the first 2 hours, hose A filled 2/8 or 1/4 of the pool.
  Let's say the rate of hose A is a and the rate of hose B is b.
  In the next 3 hours, both hoses working together filled 3/8 of the pool, which means:
    1 - 1/4 - 3/8 = 1/8 of the pool was filled by hose B alone in the last 3 hours.
  Let's use the formula rate x time = work to find the rates of hoses A and B.
  For the first 2 hours, hose A filled 1/4 of the pool, so:
    a x 2 = 1/4
    a = 1/8
  For the last 3 hours, hoses A and B together filled 3/8 of the pool, so:
    (a + b) x 3 = 3/8
    b = 1/24
  To find how long hose B, working alone, would fill the pool, we can use the formula:

  Let's assume that the volume of the pool is 1 unit.
  Hose A can fill the pool in 8 hours. Therefore, Hose A can fill 1/8 of the pool in 1 hour.
  Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours. Therefore, the amount of the pool left to fill is 1 - (2/8) = 3/4.
  Let's assume that hose B can fill 1/X of the pool in 1 hour.
  The two hoses, working together, finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. Therefore, they filled the remaining 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours.
  Using the formula: Work = Rate * Time, we can derive the following equation:
  (1/8 + 1/X) * 3 = 3/4
  Solving for X, we get X = 24/5.
  Therefore, Hose B can fill 5/24 of the pool in 1 hour.
  To find out how long Hose B takes to fill the entire pool, we can use the formula:
  Work = Rate * Time
  1 = (5/24) * Time
  Time = 24/5 hours.
  Therefore, Hose B, working alone, would take 24/5 hours to fill the entire pool.

- During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, and only 20 had tags from the previous year. This means that 480 of the deer were not tagged in 2001.
- If the percentage of deer in the sample that had tags represents the percentage of the total population with tags, then the ratio of tagged deer to total deer is the same in both years. 

Let x be the total deer population in the forest. 
- In 2001, 300 deer were tagged. This means that the ratio of tagged deer to total deer in 2001 is 300/x. 
- In 2002, 20 tagged deer were caught out of 500 deer, so the ratio of tagged deer to total deer in 2002 is 20/500.

Since the ratio of tagged deer to total deer is the same in both years:
  300/x = 20/500
  
Solving for x:
  300/x = 20/500
  Cross-multiplying: 20x = 300 * 500

Let's find the remainder first:
  Remainder = Dividend - Quotient x Divisor

  Let's call the common remainder as ""x"" and the quotient for 2272 and 875 be ""a"" and ""b"" respectively, then we can write:

  Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.
  So, Jack's work rate is 1 yacht / 12 hours = 1/12 yacht/hour
  On a particular day, Jack finishes 2/3 of the work.
  So, the remaining work is 1/3 of the yacht.
  Let's assume it takes Jill ""t"" hours to finish the remaining work.
  Jill's work rate is 5% of Jack's work rate = 5/100 * (1/12) = 1/240 yacht/hour
  At this rate, Jill can clean (1/240) * t portion of the yacht.
  Setting the portion of the yacht cleaned by Jack plus the portion of the yacht cleaned by Jill equal to the total portion of the yacht, we get:

  2/3 + (1/240)*t = 1/3
  (1/240)*t = 1/3 - 2/3
  (1/240)*t = 1/3 - 2/3 * 3/3
  (1/240)*t = 1/3 - 2/9
  (1/240)*t = (3/9) - (2/9)
  (1/240)*t = 1/9
  t = (1/9) * 240
  t = 26.67 hours

  Jill takes 26.67 hours to finish the remaining work.

  Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours.
  Therefore, Jack's rate of working is 1/12 yacht per hour.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work on a particular day.
  Therefore, the remaining work to be done is one-third of the total work.
  Let's assume the total work is equal to 12 units of work, which means Jack completed 8 units of work (two-thirds of the total work).
  Therefore, the remaining work to be done is 4 units of work.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do.
  Therefore, Jill's rate of working is 5/100 * 1/12 = 1/240 yacht per hour.
  Let's assume Jill takes x hours to finish the remaining work.
  Therefore, Jill completes 1/x of the remaining work per hour.
  Jack has already completed two-thirds of the work, so the work remaining to be done is 4 units.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 1/240 * x = 4.
  Solving for x, we get x = 960.
  Therefore, Jill takes 960 hours to finish the remaining work.
  However, we need to convert the answer to a whole number of hours.
  Jill takes 960 hours to finish the remaining work, but she only starts working after Jack has finished two-thirds of the work.
  Jack completes two-thirds of the work in 2/3 * 12 = 8 hours.
  Therefore, Jill has 960 - 8 = 952 hours left to complete the remaining work.

  It took Jack 12 hours to clean the yacht by himself.
  On a particular day, Jack finished 2/3 of the work, so the remaining portion of the work is 1/3 of the total work.
  If Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, then Jill's rate is 5/100 * Jack's rate.
  Let's assume that the rate at which Jack cleans is 1 unit of work per hour. Then, Jill's rate is 5/100 * 1 = 0.05 units of work per hour.
  Let's now find out how much time Jill takes to do the remaining 1/3 of the work.
  Let's assume that Jill takes x hours to do the remaining 1/3 of the work.
  Jack has already finished 2/3 of the work, so he took 2/3 * 12 = 8 hours to finish that part of the work.
  The portion of the work done by Jill is 1/3, and her rate is 0.05 units of work per hour, so the total time she takes is (1/3) / 0.05 = 6.67 hours, which is approximately 6 hours and 40 minutes.

- Let's say it takes Jill x hours to finish the remaining work. Then Jill's work rate is 1/x of the total work per hour. 
- Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her work rate is 5% of Jack's work rate, which is 5% of 1/12. 
- We can add Jack and Jill's work rates to get the combined work rate: 
  1/12 + (5/100)(1/12) = 0.0133 (rounded to 4 decimal places)
- We can use the formula Work = Rate x Time to solve for x. 
- Since Jack finished two-thirds of the work, the remaining work that Jill needs to do is 1/3 of the total work.

  Jill's rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate is 1/20 of Jack's rate.
  Let's say Jill takes x hours to clean the remaining 1/3 of the work.
  Jill's rate is 1/x of the work per hour.
  Jack has already finished 2/3 of the work, so the remaining 1/3 of the work is equal to 1/3 of 12 hours, which is 4 hours.

  This means, the remaining 1/3 of the work will take 12x - 8x = 4x hours to complete.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's rate of cleaning.

  Let's assume that the diver found x copper coins and y brass coins.
  For each copper coin, the diver gets 20 cents, so the total amount of money she gets from copper coins is 20x cents.
  For each brass coin, the diver gets 25 cents, so the total amount of money she gets from brass coins is 25y cents.
  We know that the total amount of money she gets from both types of coins is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  So we can form the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which is equivalent to finding the minimum value of x that satisfies the equation.
  To solve for x, we need another equation that relates x and y.
  We know that the total number of coins she brought is x + y.
  We also know that the total amount of money she gets from the coins is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  So we can form another equation x + y = (340/20) + (340/25), which simplifies to x + y = 34.
  Now we have two equations and two variables, which we can solve using substitution or elimination.
  Solving for y in the second equation, we get y = 34 - x.
  Substituting this into the first equation, we get 20x + 25(34 - x) = 340.
  Simplifying this, we get 5x = 90, which gives us x = 18.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 18.

   Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
   The amount she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and for each brass coin is 25 cents.
   Then, the total amount she earned after one dive is 20x + 25y cents.
   We know that the total amount she earned after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
   So, we have the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
   We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to find the minimum value of x.
   We can simplify the equation 20x + 25y = 340 by dividing both sides by 5, which gives us 4x + 5y = 68.
   If we try different values of y, starting from y=0, we can find the minimum value of x that satisfies the equation.
   If y=0, then 4x = 68, which gives us x = 17.
   If y=1, then 4x + 5 = 68, which gives us x = 16/4 = 4.
   If y=2, then 4x + 10 = 68, which gives us x = 14/2 = 7.
   If y=3, then 4x + 15 = 68, which gives us x = 13.25, which is not an integer.

  Let's assume the number of copper coins the diver brought is ""C"", and the number of brass coins she brought is ""B"".
  The amount she got for each copper coin is 20 cents, so the total amount she got for ""C"" copper coins is 20C cents.
  Similarly, the amount she got for each brass coin is 25 cents, so the total amount she got for ""B"" brass coins is 25B cents.
  The total amount she got for both types of coins is $3.40 = 340 cents.
  So, we can write an equation: 20C + 25B = 340.
  We also know that the number of coins cannot be negative, so C and B must be non-negative integers.
  We need to find the minimum value of C.
  Let's try to solve this by substitution. We can rearrange the equation as 4C + 5B = 68.
  Now, we can start with the smallest possible value of C (which is 0) and try different values of B until we find a solution where both C and B are non-negative integers.
  If C = 0, then the equation becomes 5B = 68, which has no solution where B is a non-negative integer.
  If C = 1, then the equation becomes 4 + 5B = 68, which has a solution where B = 12.
  If C = 2, then the equation becomes 8 + 5B = 68, which has a solution where B = 12.
  If C = 3, then the equation becomes 12 + 5B = 68, which has a solution where B = 11.

  Let's call our three-digit number as ABC, where A, B, and C represent the digits in the hundredth, tenth, and unit places, respectively.
  We know that A + B + C = 17.
  We also know that A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109.
  We know that if we subtract 495 from ABC, we get CBA.
  Let's solve this problem step by step.
  
  First, we can use the equation A + B + C = 17 to find the value of A in terms of B and C.
  A = 17 - B - C
  
  We can then use this value of A to rewrite the equation A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 in terms of B and C.
  (17 - B - C)^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109
  
  Simplifying this equation gives:
  2B^2 + 2C^2 + 2BC - 34B - 34C + 90 = 0
  
  We can rewrite this equation as:
  B^2 + C^2 + BC - 17B - 17C + 45 = 0
  
  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for B and C:
  B = (17 ± sqrt(289 - 4(1)(-16))) / 2 = 9 or 8
  C = (17 ± sqrt(289 - 4(1)(-16))) / 2 = 1 or 4
  
  We can discard the solution B = 9, C = 1 because the sum of the digits is 17, not 19.
  Therefore, we have two possible values for our three-digit number: 981 and 841.
  
  We need to check which of these numbers satisfies the condition that if we subtract 495 from the number, we get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order.
  
  981 - 495 = 486, which is not the reverse of 981.
  841 - 495 = 346, which is the reverse of 841.
  
  Therefore, the number is 841.

  Let's suppose the three digit number is abc, therefore:

    abc - 495 = cba ---- equation 3
  
  We can simplify equation 3 into:
    100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
    99a - 99c = 495
    a - c = 5 ---- equation 4

  From equation 1, we have that a = 17 - b - c. 
  Substituting it in equation 2:
    (17 - b - c)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
    2b^2 + 2c^2 + 2bc - 34b - 34c + 58 = 0
    b^2 + c^2 + bc - 17b - 17c + 29 = 0 ---- equation 5

  We can use equation 4 to get a in terms of b and c:
    a = c + 5

  Substituting the above and a^2 in terms of b and c in equation 2:
    (c+5)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
    2c^2 + 2cb + b^2 + 10c - 17b + 30 = 0 ---- equation 6

  We can solve equations 5 and 6 simultaneously to get b and c:
    b = 7, c = 5

  According to the problem, ABC-CBA=495.
  Therefore, (100A+10B+C)-(100C+10B+A)=495.
  Simplifying the above equation yields: 99A-99C=495, which is equivalent to A-C=5.
  We can now use a system of equations to solve for A, B, and C.
  From A-C=5, we can have two possible solutions: (A,C)=(6,1) or (A,C)=(7,2).
  If (A,C)=(6,1), then B=10-A-C=3.

  Let's call the three-digit number ""abc"", where a, b, and c are the hundreds, tens, and ones digit, respectively.
  From the problem, we know that:
  a + b + c = 17
  a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
  If we subtract 495 from abc, we get a number with the digits reversed: cba.
  Therefore, abc - 495 = cba
  We can rewrite abc as 100a + 10b + c, and cba as 100c + 10b + a.
  Substituting these expressions into abc - 495 = cba, we get:
  100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a
  Simplifying, we get:
  99a - 99c = 495
  a - c = 5
  We can use this equation along with the first equation to solve for a, b, and c.

Calculations:
  From a + b + c = 17 and a - c = 5, we get:
  c = a - 5
  Substituting this into a + b + c = 17, we get:
  a + b + (a - 5) = 17
  2a + b = 22
  Rearranging the equation, we get:
  b = 22 - 2a
  We can use this expression for b to rewrite the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 in terms of a and c:
  a^2 + (22 - 2a)^2 + (a - 5)^2 = 109
  Simplifying and solving for a, we get:
  a = 4
  Substituting this into b = 22 - 2a and c = a - 5, we get:
  a = 4
  b = 14
  c = -1 (which is not a digit)
  However, since a + b + c = 17, we know that c must be equal to 4.
  Therefore, the three-digit number is 4ab, and from a + b + c = 17, we get:
  4 + a + b = 17
  a + b = 13
  The only two-digit numbers whose digits add up to 13 are 49 and 58.
  Checking the sum of the squares of the digits, we find that only 58 works: 5^2 + 8^2 = 89.

  We can use this equation along with a + b + c = 17 to solve for a, b, and c.
  There are a few possible ways to do this, but one way is to substitute a = c + 5 into the equation a + b + c = 17 to get 2c + 5 + b = 17 or b = 12 - 2c.
  We can then substitute a = c + 5 and b = 12 - 2c into the equation a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 and simplify to get 6c^2 + 24c - 77 = 0.

  The number of files infected by either a virus or a worm or both is 250.

  Also, 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so there are 125 files not infected by a virus.

- We know that V + W + VW = 250 (as all 250 files are infected).
- We also know that W = 2.5VW (as the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm).
- We want to find the number of files that were not infected by a worm. Let's represent this as X.
- We know that V + VW + X = 125 (as 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, so the total number of files that were not infected by a worm is 125).

Calculation:
- From V + W + VW = 250, we know that W = 250 - V - VW.
- Substituting this into W = 2.5VW, we get 250 - V - VW = 2.5VW.
- Simplifying this, we get 250 - V = 3.5VW.
- From V + VW + X = 125, we know that VW = 125 - V - X.
- Substituting this into 250 - V = 3.5VW, we get 250 - V = 3.5(VW) = 3.5(125 - V - X).
- Simplifying this, we get 250 - V = 437.5 - 3.5V - 3.5X.
- Rearranging this, we get 2.5V + 3.5X = 187.5.

- To find X, we can substitute W = 2.5VW into the equation V + W + VW = 250, and get V + 3.5VW = 250. Substituting VW = 125 - V - X, we get V + 3.5(125 - V - X) = 250. Simplifying this, we get 437.5 - 2.5V - 3.5X = 0. Rearranging this, we get 3.5X = 187.5 - 2.5V. Substituting 187.5 - 2.5V for 3.5X in the equation 2.5V + 3.5X = 187.5, we get 2.5V + (187.5 - 2.5V)/3.5 = 187.5/3.5 = 53.57. Solving for V, we get V = 21.43.

  We can simplify the two equations above by substituting W = 2.5B into the first equation:

  We can then use the two equations above to solve for V and B:

  Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

  Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only.
  Let W be the number of files infected by a worm only.
  Let B be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  We are given that V + W + B = 250 files.
  We are also given that W = 2.5B.
  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means that V + B = 0.5(250) = 125 files.
  We can use this information to create an equation in terms of B.
  V + B = 125
  B = 125 - V
  Substituting B with 2.5B in terms of V, we get
  W = 2.5B = 2.5(125 - V) = 312.5 - 2.5V
  Adding up the number of files that are infected only by a virus, infected only by a worm, and infected by both a virus and a worm, we get
  V + W + B = V + 312.5 - 2.5V + 125 - V = 437.5 - 2.5V
  Since V + W + B = 250, we can solve for V
  V + W + B = 437.5 - 2.5V = 250
  1.5V = 187.5
  V = 125
  Therefore, B = 0 and W = 312.5.

Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the question. 
Let's assume:
  The number of files infected only by virus is v,
  The number of files infected only by worm is w,
  The number of files infected by both virus and worm is b.

From the given information:
  w = 2.5b    (Equation 1)
  v + b + w = 250    (Equation 2)
  v = 0.5(250) = 125    (50% of the files were not infected by a virus)

Substituting v=125 in Equation 2:
  125 + b + w = 250
  b + w = 125    (Equation 3)

Substituting w=2.5b from Equation 1 in Equation 3:
  b + 2.5b = 125
  3.5b = 125
  b = 35.7 (approx)

Substituting b=35.7 in Equation 3:

  Let's assign variables to the quantities we don't know yet:
  Let's call the number of papers ordered on Monday ""m"".
  The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week. 
  Let's call the number of papers ordered on any other day of the week ""o"".
  On Sunday, the hotel orders twice as many as any other day of the week so that's 2o.
  We know that the total cost of the newspapers is $210 per week.
  We also know that a newspaper costs $4 on Sunday and $1 on any other day of the week.
  We can set up an equation to solve for the number of papers ordered on Monday:
  
  4(2o) + 1(5o) = 210
  8o + 5o = 210 / 4
  13o = 52.5
  o = 4.05 (rounded to nearest hundredth)
  Since ""o"" represents the number of papers purchased on any other day of the week, it must be a whole number.
  Therefore, we must round up to 5.
  The hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so it ordered 2(5) = <<2*5=10>>10 papers on Sunday.
  Therefore, the total number of papers ordered by the hotel is 10 + 5m.
  We can now solve for ""m"" using the equation:
  
  4(10) + 1m(5) = 210
  40 + 5m = 210

  When they meet for the first time, they have covered the same distance.
  Let's suppose the distance between X and Y is d.
  By the time they meet for the first time, Allen travels a distance of d/2. 
  By the time they meet for the first time, Bob travels a distance of d/2.
  Therefore, the sum of the distances they travel by the time they meet for the first time is d.

  When Allen changes his direction at Y and starts moving towards X, he has covered a distance of d/2.
  At this time, Bob is also at Y and he starts moving towards X. Therefore, Bob has to cover the remaining distance between X and Y, which is d - d/2 = d/2.

  Let's suppose the time they take to meet again after changing their directions is t.
  Distance travelled by Allen in t hours = 54t.
  Distance travelled by Bob in t hours = 78t.

  Distance travelled by Bob - Distance travelled by Allen = 48km
  78t - 54t = 48
  t = 4

  Distance travelled by Allen from Y to X = d/2
  Distance travelled by Allen from X to Y = d/2
  Therefore, the total distance travelled by Allen = d

  Distance travelled by Bob from X to Y = d/2
  Distance travelled by Bob from Y to X = 78 x 4 = 312 km
  Therefore, the total distance travelled by Bob = d/2 + 312

  Distance travelled by Bob - Distance travelled by Allen = 48km

  The time taken for Bob to travel d/2 is (d/2)/78 = d/156.
  After Allen changes direction, he travels a distance of d/2 before he meets Bob again.
  The time taken for Allen to travel d/2 is (d/2)/54 = d/108.
  The time taken for Bob to travel the extra 48 km is 48/78 = 16/26 = 8/13 hours.
  During this time, Allen travels a distance of (8/13)*54 = 32.77 km.
  Let the distance travelled by Bob before he changes direction be x km.
  Then, the distance travelled by Bob after he changes direction is (d-x) km.
  The time taken for Bob to travel x km is x/78.
  The time taken for Bob to travel (d-x) km is (d-x)/78.
  The total time taken for Bob to travel x km and (d-x) km is (d/156) + (x/78) + ((d-x)/78).
  The total time taken for Allen to travel (d/2) km and 32.77 km is (d/108) + (32.77/54).
  We know that Bob takes twice as long as Allen to travel the same distance.
  Therefore, (d/108) + (32.77/54) = 2*((d/156) + (x/78) + ((d-x)/78)).
  Simplifying this equation, we get 15d - 30x = 2d - 2x + 2496.
  Rearranging the terms, we get 13d = 28x + 2496.
  We also know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen after they meet for the second time.

  The number of water lilies doubles every two days.
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  Let's try to find out after how many days the lake will be fully covered with lilies, if initially, there were 2 water lilies on it.
  After 2 days, the number of water lilies will double to become 4.
  After 2 more days, the number of water lilies will double to become 8.
  After 2 more days, the number of water lilies will double to become 16.
  After 2 more days, the number of water lilies will double to become 32.
  After 2 more days, the number of water lilies will double to become 64, which is the number of water lilies initially.
  Therefore, it will take 10 days for the lake to be fully covered with lilies if initially, there were 2 water lilies on it.
  Since 64 = 2^6, it means that there were 6 doubling periods before the lake was fully covered with lilies.
  Therefore, the total number of days it took for the lake to be fully covered with lilies is 6 * 2 = 12 days.
  Now, we need to find out the number of days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially, there were 64 water lilies.
  Since 64 = 2^6, it means that there were 6 doubling periods before the lake was fully covered with lilies.
  Therefore, the total number of days it will take for the lake to be fully covered with lilies is 6 * 2 = 12 days.
  However, we need to add the number of days it took for the initial 64 water lilies to double to cover the entire lake.
  This will be 60 - 12 = 48 days.

  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies is multiplied by 2 every two days.
  If there were 1 water lily initially, it takes 60 days to cover the lake fully. This means the number of lilies doubles 30 times (60/2=30) because each doubling takes 2 days.
  If there were 64 water lilies initially, we need to find out how many times it will take for the number of lilies to double to a number that will cover the lake fully.
  We know that the number of lilies doubles 30 times to cover the lake fully, so we can set up an equation:
  64 x 2^n = 2^30, where n is the number of doublings needed to cover the lake fully.
  Divide both sides by 64 to get: 2^n = 2^25

  Train M travels for 4 hours from A to B.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours from B to A.
  The trains have a relative speed of (the sum of their speeds).
  The time travelled since Train M left can be used to determine the distance it has covered.
  The time travelled since Train N left can be used to determine the distance it has covered.
  The distance covered by both the trains combined is the distance between City A and City B.
  Using the formula: distance = speed x time, we can determine the relative speed required to cover the distance between City A and City B in the time they cross each other.
  To find the time when they cross each other, we need to add the time travelled by Train N to 7 am.
  Therefore, we can find the answer using the formula: time = 7 am + (distance between City A and City B / relative speed of the trains).
  
Calculation:
  Distance between City A and City B = Distance travelled by Train M + Distance travelled by Train N
                                     = Speed of Train M x Time taken by Train M + Speed of Train N x Time taken by Train N
                                     = 4 x Speed of Train M + 3.5 x Speed of Train N
  
  Relative speed of the trains = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N
  
  We know that Train M took 4 hours to travel from A to B, so we can say:
  Speed of Train M = (Distance between City A and City B) / 4
  
  We also know that Train N took 3.5 hours to travel from B to A, so we can say:
  Speed of Train N = (Distance between City A and City B) / 3.5
  
  Substituting the values:
  Distance between City A and City B = 4 x [(Distance between City A and City B) / 4] + 3.5 x [(Distance between City A and City B) / 3.5]
  Distance between City A and City B = 4 x (Distance between City A and City B) / 4 + 3.5 x (Distance between City A and City B) / 3.5
  Distance between City A and City B = Distance between City A and City B + Distance between City A and City B

  Let's assume that the distance between the two cities is d.
  Train M travels (d/2) km in 4 hours.
  Train N travels (d/2) km in 3.5 hours.
  The total distance traveled by both trains is d km.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed
  Let's assume the speed of train M is x km/h and the speed of train N is y km/h.
  From the above formula, we can derive:
  time taken by train M = (d/2) / x
  time taken by train N = (d/2) / y
  Adding the above two equations, we get:

After x kg of mixture is removed, the amount of sand in the mixture will still be 3kg, but the percentage of sand in the mixture will change.
The new percentage of sand in the mixture will be (3 / (10 - x)) * 100
The new percentage of clay in the mixture will be (7 / (10 - x)) * 100
To make the mixture contain equal quantities of clay and sand, the new percentage of sand and clay must be equal.
Therefore, we can set up an equation:
(3 / (10 - x)) * 100 = (7 / (10 - x)) * 100
Simplifying this equation, we get:
3 = 7
This is not true. Therefore, there is no solution to this problem.

  10kg of mixture has 30% sand and 70% clay.
  This means the mixture has 3kg of sand and 7kg of clay.
  To make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, we need to add 4kg of sand and remove 4kg of clay.
  We are only replacing the sand part, so we need to remove a portion of the mixture that contains only clay.
  We can find out how much to remove by setting up a proportion.
  7kg of clay is 70% of the mixture, so the whole mixture is 10kg/0.7 = 14.2857kg.
  We need to remove 4kg of clay, which is 4/14.2857 of the current mixture.
  Therefore, we need to remove 4/14.2857 * 10kg = 2.8kg of the mixture.

  Let's assume that the rectangular plot has length L and width W.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is given as 2(L + W) = 340 m.
  Therefore, L + W = 170 m.
  The length of the rectangle is L = 170 - W.
  The breadth of the garden will be (W + 2) meters and length will be (L + 2) meters.
  The area of the rectangular plot = L * W.
  The area of the garden = (L + 2) * (W + 2).
  The area of the garden can be written as:
  (L + 2) * (W + 2) = (170 - W + 2) * (W + 2) = 2W^2 + 174W + 336
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter = 10.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the entire garden = 10 * (2W^2 + 174W + 336) = 20W^2 + 1740W + 3360
  Now, we need to find the value of W.
  We can find the value of W by using the fact that the area of the rectangular plot = L * W = (170 - W) * W = 170W - W^2.
  We can then find the value of W that maximizes the area of the garden.
  The maximum value of the area of the garden will occur at the maximum value of W.
  The maximum value of (2W^2 + 174W + 336) will occur at W = -87/2.
  This value of W is not possible because W cannot be negative.
  Therefore, it is not possible to determine the cost of gardening.

  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 340 metres.
  Let the length and the breadth of the rectangular plot be L and B respectively.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340.
  So, L+B = 170.
  Let the length and the breadth of the rectangular plot including the 1-meter broad boundary be L1 and B1 respectively.
  Therefore, L1 = L+2 and B1 = B+2.
  The area of the boundary is (L1 x B1) - (L x B).
  Substituting L1 = L+2 and B1 = B+2, we get the area of the boundary as (L+2)(B+2) - LB = 2L + 2B + 4.
  Cost of gardening 1 square metre = 10.
  So, the cost of gardening the boundary = 10 x (2L + 2B + 4).
  Substituting L+B = 170, we get the cost of gardening = 10 x (2(170-B) + 4).
  Simplifying the equation, we get cost of gardening = 3400 - 20B.
  Since we don't know the value of B, we can't determine the cost of gardening.

  l+b = 170
  We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by the formula l*b.
  The area of the rectangular plot can be calculated as (l-2)*(b-2) because we need to leave a 1-meter boundary around the plot for gardening.
  The cost of gardening 1 square metre is given as $10.
  So, the total cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot would be (l-2)*(b-2)*10.

  The area of the boundary will be (L + 2) * (W + 2) - LW.
  The cost of gardening will be the area of the boundary times the rate of 10 per square metre.
  Substituting L + W = 170 into the expression for the area of the boundary, we get (L + 2) * (W + 2) - LW = 174.

  We want to find the cost of gardening a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangle.
  The length and breadth of the garden plot after including the boundary will be L+2 and B+2, respectively.
  The area of the garden plot including the boundary will be (L+2)(B+2).
  The area of the garden plot without the boundary will be LB.
  The area of the boundary will be the difference between the area of the garden plot including and excluding the boundary.
  The area of the boundary will be (L+2)(B+2) - LB.
  The cost of gardening the boundary will be the area of the boundary times the cost per square meter, which is 10.

  Let's represent Joe's age, his sister's age and his father's age as J, S and F respectively.
  From the first statement, we have:
  J + S + F = 100
  From the second statement, we know that Joe's father is older than Joe, and his sister is younger than Joe.
  Let X be the number of years before Joe is as old as his father.
  Then, Joe's age at that time will be J + X and his father's age will be F + X.
  And we also know that S + X = 2S, which implies X = S, so Joe's sister's current age is S = X.
  From the third statement, we know that at the time Joe is as old as his father, his father is twice as old as the sister was when her father was as old as Joe is now.
  Let Y be the number of years after this point when the sister was as old as Joe is now.
  Then we have: F + X + Y = 2*(S + Y) = 2*(X + Y)
  Simplifying this equation, we get: F = X + Y
  Now we have two equations with two unknowns: J + S + F = 100 and F = X + Y.
  We can use substitution to eliminate F and get an equation in J and S only:
  J + S + X + Y = 100 (substituting F = X + Y)
  J + X + S = 100 - Y
  J + X = 100 - S - Y
  But we also know that F = X + Y, so:
  F = 100 - J - X = 2*(S + Y)
  Substituting F = X + Y, we get:
  100 - J - X = 2*(S + Y) - X - Y
  100 - J = 2*S + Y
  Y = 100 - J - 2*S
  Substituting this value of Y back into F = X + Y, we get:
  F = X + 100 - J - 2*S
  But we also know that F = J + S + X, so:
  J + S + X = X + 100 - J - 2*S
  2*J + 3*S = 100
  We also know that J + S + F = 100, so:
  F = 100 - J - S
  Substituting this into F = X + Y, we get:
  100 - J - S = X + 100 - J - 2*S
  S = X
  Substituting this into 2*J + 3*S = 100, we get:
  2*J + 3*X = 100
  And substituting this into J + S + F = 100, we get:
  F = 100 - 2*X - J
  Now we have two equations in two unknowns: 2*J + 3*X = 100 and F = 100 - 2*X - J.
  We can solve for J and X and then find F.
  Multiplying the first equation by 2 and subtracting the second equation, we get:
  4*X = 100 - F
  F = 100 - 4*X
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
  100 - 4*X = 100 - 2*X - J
  2*X = J
  Substituting this into 2*J + 3*X = 100, we get:
  J = 34
  X = 17
  F = 100 - J - S = 100 - 34 - 17 = 49

  Simplifying the above equation, we get F = 2J - S
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, F = 2(S - (F-S))
  Simplifying the above equation, we get F = 3S - 2J
  
  Now, we can substitute the value of F from the second equation into the third equation and solve for S:
  2J - S = 3S - 2J
  4J = 4S
  J = S
  
  Using the first equation, we can rewrite it as 2J + F = 100 or F = 100 - 2J
  
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
  100 - J = 2(2J - S - J)
  100 - J = 2(J - S)
  100 - J = 2(J - J)
  100 - J = 0
  J = 100

  We know that j + s + f = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father (f), his sister (s) will be twice as old as she is now (2s).
  So, we can set up an equation: j + f = 2s.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father (f), his father will be twice as old as when his sister (s) was as old as her father (f).
  We can set up another equation: f - j = 2(f - s).
  We have two equations and two unknowns, so we can solve for f.

Calculation:
  j + s + f = 100
  j + f = 2s
  f - j = 2(f - s)

  Solving the first equation for f:
  f = 100 - j - s

  Substituting f in terms of j and s in the second equation:
  (100 - j - s) - j = 2s
  100 - 2j - s = 2s
  100 - 3j = 3s
  s = (100 - 3j) / 3

  Substituting s in terms of j in the first equation:
  j + f = 2s
  j + (100 - j - s) = 2s
  j + (100 - j - (100 - 3j)/3) = 2((100 - 3j) / 3)
  j + (100 - j - (100 - 3j)/3) = (200 - 6j) / 3
  j + 3(100 - j) / 3 - (100 - 3j)/3 = (200 - 6j) / 3

  Let's assume the distance between A and B is ""d"" miles.
  Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B. Let's say he took ""t1"" hours to complete this part of the trip.
  Once he reached B, he turned around and drove back to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Let's say he took ""t2"" hours to complete this part of the trip.
  We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  Let's calculate the total time of his trip.
  Total time of the trip = t1 + t2
  We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  Therefore, t2 - 3 = 70 / 90
  => t2 = 25/3 hours
  Also, we know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B and at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
  Therefore, d = 70*t1 = 90*t2

  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B as ""t"".
  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from B to A as ""k"".
  We know that distance = rate x time.
  Therefore, d = 70t for the trip from A to B.
  And, d = 90k for the trip from B to A.
  We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  That means, he has already traveled ""d - 70"" miles of his return trip.
  We also know that he has 3 hours left to complete his trip.
  So, we can create the following equation: (d - 70) = 90 * (k - 3).
  We can also create another equation using the information we have about his trip from A to B: d = 70t.
  Now, we can solve for ""d"".
  First, let's solve for ""k"" using the equation (d - 70) = 90 * (k - 3).
  d - 70 = 90k - 270
  d = 90k - 200   ...(1)
  Next, let's substitute the value of ""d"" from equation (1) into the equation d = 70t.
  90k - 200 = 70t
  9k - 20 = 7t
  9k = 7t + 20   ...(2)
  We are given that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  That means he has already traveled (d - 70) miles of his return trip.
  We can substitute the value of ""d"" from equation (1) into this equation to get:
  d - 70 = 90 * (k - t)
  d - 70 = 90k - 90t
  d = 90k - 90t + 70
  Now, we can substitute the value of ""t"" from equation (2) into this equation to get:
  d = 90k - 90(9k/7 + 20/7) + 70
  d = 90k - 90(9k/7) - 90(20/7) + 70
  d = 90k - 90(9k)/7 - 1800/7 + 70
  d = (630k - 810k + 70*7 - 1800)/7
  d = (-180k + 574)/7

  The total distance Kevin drove is 2D.
  The time Kevin spent on the road is 2t.
  Let T be the total time of Kevin's trip.
  T = 2t + pause time.
  3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and only 70 miles away from it.
  When Kevin was 70 miles away from B, he had driven D - 70 miles from A.
  The remaining distance to complete the round trip is D + 70 miles.
  Let t1 be the time Kevin has spent on the road when he was 70 miles away from B.
  t1 = (D - 70) / 70
  Then, the time he has left before the end of his trip is T - 3 = 2t + pause time - 3
  The time he needs to complete the round trip is (D + 70) / 90
  The equation we can form from the above information is:
  T - 3 = t1 + (D + 70) / 90
  2t + pause time - 3 = (D - 70) / 70 + (D + 70) / 90
  We can simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 630:
  1260t + 630 pause time - 1890 = 9D
  63D + 4410 = 126t + 9D
  54D = 126t - 4410
  D = (126t - 4410) / 54
  We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B.
  Therefore, D = 70t.
  We can substitute D with 70t in the equation above:
  70t = (126t - 4410) / 54
  3780t = 126t - 4410
  252t = 4410
  t = 4410 / 252 = 35 / 2

The organization wants to raise Rs. 6 lakh by collecting equal contribution from each employee. Let's say each employee contributes x amount. So, if there are n employees in the organization, the total amount raised will be n * x. 
According to the problem, n * x = Rs. 6,00,000 --------- Equation 1
If each employee had contributed Rs.60 extra, then each employee would have contributed (x + 60) amount. So, the total amount raised would have been n * (x + 60) = Rs. 6,24,000. 
n * (x + 60) = Rs. 6,24,000 --------- Equation 2
We need to find the value of n.
From equation 1, x = (6,00,000) / n
Substituting the value of x in equation 2, we get:
n * ((6,00,000 / n) + 60) = 6,24,000
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
6,00,000 + 60n = 6,24,000
60n = 24,000
n = (24,000 / 60) = 400
Therefore, there are 400 employees in that organization.

To solve this problem, we can use a system of two equations with two variables.
Let's assume that the number of employees is ""n"" and the original contribution from each employee is ""x"".
From the problem, we know that:
- nx = 600000
- n(x+60) = 624000

We can solve for ""n"" by dividing the second equation by the first equation:
- n(x+60)/nx = 624000/600000
- (x+60)/x = 1.04
- x + 60 = 1.04x
- 0.04x = 60
- x = 1500

Now that we know ""x"", we can find ""n"" by using the first equation:
- nx = 600000
- n = 600000/x
- n = 600000/1500
- n = 400

Therefore, there are 400 employees in the organization.

The total number of people who received money is 5+4+2 = 11.
The total amount of money distributed is Rs 8600.
We can now create an equation to solve for x.

  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's call the additional quarter miles x. Therefore, the total miles travelled is x + 0.25 miles (for the first quarter mile).
  Each quarter mile costs 10 cents, so x quarter miles cost 10x cents = 0.10x dollars.
  The total cost is $8.50.
  So, (0.10x + 3.50) dollars = $8.50.
  Solving for x, we get x = 50.
  Therefore, the total distance travelled is 0.25 + 50*0.25 = 12.75 miles.
  The answer is B: 12.75 miles.

20% of the employees don't take a winter or summer vacation. Therefore, 20 employees don't take a summer vacation.
40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacation. Therefore, 40 employees take winter and summer vacation.

Let's assume there are 100 employees in the company, then
the number of employees who take a winter vacation = 75
the number of employees who take a winter and a summer vacation = 40
the number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation = 20
Let S be the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Then, the number of employees who take a winter and a summer vacation can be written as the sum of:
(a) the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation, and
(b) the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
Therefore, 40 = (a) + S.
Also, the number of employees who take no vacation is equal to 100 - (number of employees who take a winter vacation) - (number of employees who take a summer vacation) + (number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation) + (number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation). 
Substituting the values, we get
20 = 100 - 75 - (S + a) + 40

  40 percent take a winter and a summer vacation, so 40 employees take both.
  20 percent take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so 20 employees take neither.
  If we subtract the sum of the above employees from 100, we can find the number of people that take a summer vacation only.
  100 - (75 + 40 + 20) = 100 - 135 = -35.

  115 - (number of employees who take only winter vacation) - (number of employees who take both winter and summer vacation) - (number of employees who take neither) = number of employees who take only summer vacation
  number of employees who take only summer vacation = 115 - 75 - 40 - 20 = -20.

The number of employees who take a winter and a summer vacation is 40% of N.
The number of employees who take neither winter nor summer vacation is 20% of N.
Let x be the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations.
Then, the number of employees who take summer vacation is (40% - x) of N.
The number of employees who take summer vacation but not winter vacation is (40% - x) - x = 40% - 2x of N.
The number of employees who take summer vacation but not winter vacation is given as Q percent of the total number of employees N.
Therefore, we can write the equation (40% - 2x)N = Q% * N.
Simplifying, we get 40% - 2x = Q%, which gives us the value of Q.
To find x, we can use the fact that x is the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations, so x is the intersection of the two sets.
Let A be the set of employees who take winter vacation, and B be the set of employees who take summer vacation.
Then, we have A = 75% of N, B = (40% - x) of N, and A ∩ B = x.
Using the formula |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| - |A ∩ B|, we get:
N - 20% of N = 75% of N + (40% - x) of N - x
Simplifying, we get x = 5% of N.
Substituting x back into the equation 40% - 2x = Q%, we get Q = 30%.

  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is sqrt(250).
  We can simplify sqrt(250) by factoring out the largest perfect square factor of 250, which is 25. sqrt(250) = sqrt(25 x 10) = 5 x sqrt(10).
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2 x 5 x sqrt(10) = 10 sqrt(10).

  The train's speed is 120 miles per hour.

  Then we can use the time formula (time = distance / speed) to calculate the time it takes to pass completely through the tunnel.
  First, we need to find the length of the train in miles. We can do this by converting the speed to miles per second and multiplying by the time it takes to enter the tunnel:
  length of train = (120 miles/hour) / (3600 seconds/hour) * (3 seconds) = 0.1 miles
  The distance from the end of the train to the end of the tunnel is:

  We know that the train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1 mile long tunnel. 
  We need to find the time it takes for the whole train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles an hour = 120 * 5280 feet per hour = 633,600 feet per hour.
  We need to find how many feet long the train is in order to calculate how long it takes to pass through the tunnel.
  Let's use the formula: distance = speed x time 
  We know that the distance the train will cover in 1 hour (or 3600 seconds) is 633,600 feet.
  Let's first convert the 1 mile length of the tunnel to feet: 1 mile = 1 x 5280 = 5,280 feet.
  Using the formula mentioned above and adding the length of the tunnel to the length of the train itself, we get:
  Total distance = 633,600 x t + 5,280
  We need to find the value of t (time taken by train to pass through the tunnel completely)
  The train passes through the tunnel completely when the front of the train enters and the back of the train completely exits the tunnel.
  So, the time taken by the train to pass through the tunnel is equal to the time it takes the back of the train to enter the tunnel minus the time it takes the front of the train to enter the tunnel.
  Let's represent this as: 
  t = (length of train + length of tunnel) / relative speed 
  length of train is not given, we need to find it using the speed and the time taken to enter the tunnel. 
  We can find the length of the train using the formula mentioned above: distance = speed x time.
  The distance the front of the train has covered in 3 seconds is: 120 miles / 3600 seconds x 3 seconds = 0.1 miles = 0.1 x 5280 feet = 528 feet
  The distance the back of the train has covered in 3 seconds is: 120 miles / 3600 seconds x (3+t) seconds = (120/3600) * (3+t) * 5280 = (3+t)*176 feet
  Therefore, length of train = distance covered by back of train - distance covered by front of train
  length of train = (3+t)*176 - 528 = 528t + 24
  Substituting the length of the train, length of the tunnel and relative speed in the formula for t, we get:
  t = (length of train + length of tunnel) / relative speed 
  t = (528t + 24 + 5280) / (633,600/3600)
  t = (528t + 5304) / 176
  176t = 528t + 5304
  352t = 5304

- We know that the train is 1 mile long and it takes three seconds to enter the tunnel completely.
- We are given that the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
- If we can find out how many seconds it takes to travel a distance of 2 miles (1 mile tunnel length + 1 mile train length), we can subtract the 3 seconds it takes to enter the tunnel and get the time it takes to travel the length of the tunnel.
- We can use the formula: time = distance / speed to find out how long it takes the train to travel 2 miles.
- Distance = 2 miles, Speed = 120 miles per hour
- Converting speed to miles per second: 120 miles/hour * 1 hour/3600 seconds = 1/30 mile/second
- time = distance / speed = 2 miles / (1/30 miles/second) = 60 seconds
- The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel, so it takes an additional 57 seconds to pass completely through the tunnel.

  Let P be the marked price.
  If Karan offers a 20% discount, the selling price (S) will be 80% of the marked price (P).
  Therefore, S = 0.8P.
  If Karan wants to make a 20% profit, his profit (Pr) will be 20% of the cost price (C).
  Therefore, Pr = 0.2C.

  Karan's cost price (CP) of the sewing machine is Rs. 1200/-
  Karan wants to make a profit of 20% after offering a 20% discount.
  Let's first calculate the selling price (SP) without offering a discount:
  Profit Percentage (P%) = (Profit / CP) * 100
  Since Karan wants to make a 20% profit, P% = 20
  P% = (SP - CP) / CP * 100
  20 = (SP - 1200) / 1200 * 100
  SP = 1200 * (100 + 20) / 100
  SP = 1440
  Now, let's calculate the selling price with 20% discount:
  Discount = 20% of SP = (20/100) * 1440 = 288
  Selling price (after discount) = SP - Discount = 1440 - 288 = 1152
  Karan wants to make a 20% profit after offering a 20% discount.

Let's start by setting up some equations based on the given information.  

  Let t be the number of total staplers produced on Monday.
  Let d be the number of defective staplers produced on Monday.
  Let n be the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday.
  
  From the first piece of information, we know that 10% of the staplers produced on Monday were defective. So, we can write:
  d = 0.10t
  
  From the second piece of information, we know that 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. We also know that the number of non-defective staplers rejected was 72. So, we can write:
  0.02n = 72
  
  Now, we can use these equations to solve for t, the total number of staplers produced:
  (1)  d + n = t   (since every stapler produced will either be defective or non-defective)
  (2)  d = 0.10t  (from the first piece of information)
  (3)  0.02n = 72  (from the second piece of information)
  
  We can substitute (2) and (3) into (1) to get:
  0.10t + 50n = t
  
  Solving for t, we get:
  0.90t = 50n
  t = 55.56n
  
  We know that n represents the number of non-defective staplers produced, and that 72 of these were rejected by mistake. So, the total number of non-defective staplers produced is:
  n = 72 / 0.02 = 3,600
  
  Finally, we can find the total number of staplers produced by using the equation we derived earlier:
  t = 55.56n = 55.56 * 3,600 = 200,016

To guarantee that we have at least two ties of the same color, we can use the Pigeonhole Principle.

If we pick 2 ties, we still cannot guarantee that they will be the same color, but at least we have a chance.
If we pick 3 ties, there are five different colors, so we can have at most two of each color. So if we pick 3 ties, we are guaranteed to have at least two of the same color.

  The time required for each ball to complete one full rotation can be calculated.
  Ball A completes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes.
  Therefore, the time required for Ball A to complete one full rotation is 26/2 = 13 minutes.
  Ball B completes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes.
  Therefore, the time required for Ball B to complete one full rotation is 35/5 = 7 minutes.
  The time required for both balls to return to the same starting point can be calculated by finding the smallest integer that satisfies the ratio of the times required for each ball to complete an integer number of rotations to be equal.
  The first few integer ratios for the time required by each ball to complete an integer number of rotations are:

  The space shuttle also takes 5 seconds to pass a point, this time includes the length of the space shuttle and the time it takes to pass the point.
  Let L be the length of the space shuttle.

  This result is unexpected, it means that the length of the space shuttle is zero.
  We must have made a mistake somewhere in our calculation.
  Let's try to find the error.
  It's not clear whether the space shuttle travels an additional distance during the time it takes to pass a point. We will assume that the space shuttle does not travel any additional distance during this time. Therefore, the total distance traveled by the space shuttle is equal to the sum of the distance traveled during the 40 seconds it took to reach the maximum height and the length of the space shuttle.
  So we have:
  Distance = 700 + L
  Speed = Distance/Time = (700 + L)/(40 + 5) = (700 + L)/45
  Speed = distance/time = 17.5 m/s

  We know that the area of the rectangular yard is 240 square meters. So,
      L * W = 240          ---(1)
  We are given that one side of the rectangular yard is 10 meters, and we need to fence the remaining three sides. Therefore,
      Fenced perimeter = 2L + W - 10
      
  We need to substitute the value of W from equation (1) into the expression for the fenced perimeter.
      Fenced perimeter = 2L + (240/L) - 10
      
  We know that the area of a rectangular yard can be expressed in terms of its perimeter as follows:
      L * W = L * (2L + W - 10)
      240 = 2L^2 + LW - 10L
      
  We can substitute the value of W from equation (1) into the above equation and simplify to get a quadratic equation in L.
      2L^2 + 240/L - 10L - 240 = 0
      2L^3 - 10L^2 + 240 - 0*L = 0
      L^2*(2L - 10) + 240 = 0
      
  Solving the above quadratic equation gives us L = 6 or L = 20/3.
  We can discard L = 6 since it gives us a width of zero, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the length L = 20/3 meters and the width W = 12 meters.
  
  Finally, we can substitute the values of L and W into the expression for the fenced perimeter and simplify to get the answer.

  We are to find the length of fencing required which is the perimeter of the three sides.
  Perimeter of three sides = 2l + w - 10 = 2(l + w) - 10
  We can use the area of the yard to solve for l in terms of w:
  l * w = 240 => l = 240 / w
  Substituting l into the expression above:
  Perimeter of three sides = 2(240/w + w) - 10
  We can now find the value of w that will minimize the perimeter of the three sides:
  To do that, we need to find the derivative of the expression above, equate it to zero, and solve for w.
  After some algebra, we get w² - 120w + 240 = 0
  Solving for w, we get w = 60 - 10√6 or w = 60 + 10√6
  Since w represents the width, we choose the value of w that is less than the length of the rectangle.

  We are given that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced.
  This means the length of the unfenced side is w - 10.
  We know that the area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width, so lw = 240.
  We can use these equations to solve for the values of l and w.
  First we can solve for w in terms of l from the equation lw = 240.
  w = 240/l.
  We can then substitute this value of w in the equation 2l + w = perimeter of the three sides.
  2l + 240/l = perimeter of the three sides.
  We are given that one side of the yard is 10 meters unfenced, so the length of the unfenced side is w - 10.
  Therefore, the perimeter of the four sides of the yard is l + w + l + (w - 10) = 2l + 2w - 10.
  We can now set the equation for the perimeter of the three sides equal to the equation for the perimeter of the four sides, and solve for l.
  2l + 240/l = 2l + 2w - 10
  240/l = 2w - 10
  240/l = 2(240/l) - 10

  250/l = 480/l
  l^2 = 192
  l = sqrt(192)
  l = 8sqrt(3)
  Now we can use the equation w = 240/l to find the value of w.
  w = 240/(8sqrt(3))
  w = 10sqrt(3)

  Let x be the length of one of the fenced sides and y be the length of the other fenced side.
  The yard has an area of 240 square meters, so we have xy = 240.
  Alice wants to fence three sides, so the total length of fencing needed is x + 2y.
  We also know that one side is 10 meters shorter, so x = y - 10.
  Substituting x in terms of y into the equation for the area gives (y-10)y = 240.
  Simplifying this gives y^2 - 10y - 240 = 0, which factors as (y-20)(y+12) = 0.
  Since y represents a length, y = 20 (the other solution y = -12 is extraneous).
  Then x = y - 10 = 10, and the total length of fencing needed is x + 2y = 50.

  Let's assume that the length of the rectangle is x and the width is y.
  The area of a rectangle = length x width
  Therefore, the equation is xy = 240
  Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard, which means she has to fence the perimeter of the rectangle, except one side.
  The perimeter of a rectangle = 2(length + width)
  Alice will fence 3 sides, hence the equation will be 2(x+y) + 10 = perimeter of the rectangle
  Solve for x and y using the above two equations
  Then, substitute the value of x and y into the perimeter equation to get the answer.
Calculation:
  From xy = 240, we can solve for y: y = 240/x
  Substituting this into the perimeter equation: 2(x + 240/x) + 10 = perimeter
  Simplifying: 2x + 480/x + 10 = perimeter
  Multiplying by x: 2x^2 + 480 + 10x = perimeter x
  Solving for x using the quadratic formula: x = 12 or -20
  Since the length cannot be negative, we take x = 12 and solve for y: y = 240/x = 20
  Now, we can substitute x = 12 and y = 20 into the perimeter equation: 2(12 + 20) + 10 = 74
  The total fencing is 74 meters.

  Jim's dog ate every hour starting from 8:00 am until noon, so it ate for a total of 4 hours.
  Each time it ate, it consumed 1/3 of the remaining dog food.
  Therefore, at each hour, the amount of dog food remaining was 2/3 of the previous hour.
  If we let F be the amount of dog food filled in the bowl originally, then the amount of dog food remaining at each hour can be represented using this formula: F * (2/3)^n, where n is the number of hours that have passed.
  Since the dog started to eat at noon, or 4 hours after 8 am, n = 4.
  So, the amount of dog food remaining at noon is F * (2/3)^4 = F * 16/81.
  To find the percentage of dog food remaining, we can express it as a fraction of the original amount, F: (F * 16/81) / F = 16/81.
  To convert to a percentage, we multiply by 100 and get (16/81) * 100 = 19.8%.

  Jim's dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food in the bowl every hour.
  Jim's dog ate for 4 hours, starting from 8:00 am to 12:00 pm, indicating that the dog ate 3 times.
  If the dog ate 3 times, then there was 1/3 of the food remaining in the bowl after each feeding session.
  The amount of food remaining in the bowl before the dog began to eat at noon was 1/3 of 1/3 of 1/3 of the original amount of food in the bowl.
  That is (1/3)^3 = 1/27 of the original amount.
  Therefore, the percent of the original food in the dog's bowl right before the dog began to eat at noon is (1/27) × 100% = 3.70%.

Let the original price of each article be x.
Since the price of each article has decreased by 15%, the new price is 0.85x.
If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, she is spending the same amount of money as before.
Therefore, the total cost of (x * n) articles is equal to the total cost of (0.85x * (n + 5)) articles, where n is the original number of articles Anna could buy.
Using this equation, we can solve for x.
x * n = 0.85x * (n + 5)
xn = 0.85xn + 4.25x
0.15xn = 4.25x
n = 28.33
Since Anna can only buy whole articles, the original number of articles she could buy is 28.

  If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then we can write this as:
  Red/Green = 3/4
  We know that there are 120 green sweets in the bag, which means:

Let's assume that the total number of friends was ""x"".
Then, the cost per person would be 96/x.
When four people did not show up, the cost per person increased by 4. Therefore, we can set up an equation as follows:
96/x = 96/(x-4) + 4
We can solve for x as follows:
96/x - 96/(x-4) = 4

Let's assume that x is the number of friends who attended the picnic and each of them had to contribute Rs. y to make up for the absence of their four friends.
At first, the group was supposed to contribute x amount each, which means that xy = 96.
Later, due to the absence of four friends, each of the remaining friends had to contribute y+4 amount each, which means that the amount increased to (x-4)(y+4).
We can write another equation based on increased spending. (x-4)(y+4) = 96 as well.
Now we can solve these two equations to find x.
xy = 96 can be written as y = 96/x and substituted into the second equation.
(x-4)(y+4) = 96 can be written as (x-4)(96/x+4) = 96.

  We need to find the time taken by the cars to be 15 miles away from each other.

  Let's assume that the distance covered by the second car when both cars are 15 miles apart is ""x"" miles.
  At this point, the first car has covered a distance of ""x + 15"" since it is 15 miles ahead of the second car.
  Let's use the formula: distance = rate x time for each car.
  The time taken by both cars must be equal when they are 15 miles apart.
  Therefore, (x + 15)/55 = x/52.
  Solving the above equation, we get x = 780/17 which is approximately 45.88 miles.
  The time taken to cover 45.88 miles by the second car is t = 45.88/52 which is approximately 0.88 hours.

  The problem can be solved using the relative velocity formula.
  The relative velocity between two cars moving in the same direction can be found by subtracting their speeds.
  The relative velocity of the second car with respect to the first is 52 - 55 = -3 mph.
  The distance between the two cars is 15 miles.
  To find the time it takes for the second car to cover the distance of 15 miles, we can use the formula: time = distance/relative velocity.
  Plugging in the values, we get: time = 15/(-3) = -5 hours.
  The time cannot be negative, so this answer is incorrect.
  The actual time can be found by dividing the distance traveled by the relative velocity.
  The distance traveled by the second car is 15 miles.
  The relative velocity of the cars is -3 mph (negative because they are moving in the same direction).
  Therefore, time taken for the cars to be 15 miles apart is time = distance/relative velocity = 15/(-3) = -5 hours.

  We can see that L(x,y) is the sum of the greatest integer functions of x and y and (x + y).
  On the other hand, R(x,y) is the sum of the greatest integer functions of 2x and 2y.
  Let's assume that there are two positive real numbers x and y such that L(x,y) = R(x,y).

  It follows that [x] + [y] ≤ 2x + 2y - 1.

  Let's try to simplify L(x,y) and R(x,y) separately.
  For L(x,y):
    [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x.
      Since x is a real number, [x] is an integer.
    [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y.
      Since y is a real number, [y] is an integer.
    [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x+y.
      Since x+y is a real number, [x+y] is an integer.
    Therefore, L(x,y) is the sum of three integers.
  For R(x,y):
    [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x.
      Since 2x is a real number, [2x] is an integer.
    [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
      Since 2y is a real number, [2y] is an integer.
    Therefore, R(x,y) is the sum of two integers.
  Consider the inequality [x + y] ≤ [2x + 2y] = 2[x + y]. Then [x + y] = 0 or 1.
  We can check the following cases:
  Case 1: [x + y] = 0
    Then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [x] + [y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].

    Similarly, we have [2y] = 2[y] or 2[y] + 1.
    Therefore, we have two sub-cases:
      Sub-Case 1.1: [2x] = 2[x] and [2y] = 2[y]
        Then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] and R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y].
        Since [x] ≤ x, we have [x] + [y] ≤ [x+y],
        which implies L(x,y) ≤ [x+y] < [x+y]+1 ≤ 2[x+y].
        Since [x+y] = 0, we have L(x,y) < R(x,y).
      Sub-Case 1.2: [2x] = 2[x] and [2y] = 2[y] + 1 (or vice versa).
        Without loss of generality, assume [2x] = 2[x] and [2y] = 2[y] + 1.
        Then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] and R(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] + 1.
        Since [x] ≤ x, we have [x] + [y] ≤ [x+y],
        which implies L(x,y) ≤ [x+y] < [x+y]+1 ≤ 2[x+y].
        Since [x+y] = 0, we have L(x,y) < R(x,y).
  Case 2: [x + y] = 1
    Then L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + 1 and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y].

Option A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
Let's assume L(x,y) = R(x,y) and test if it is possible to find such x and y.
[L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y], R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]]
If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we have:
[x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y]
[2x - 1] < [x] ≤ [2x] and [2y - 1] < [y] ≤ [2y]
Adding the above equations, we get:
[4x + 4y - 2] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x + y] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [4x + 4y]
[2x + 2y - 1] ≤ 2[x + y] ≤ [2x] + [2y]
[2x + 2y - 1] ≤ 2[x + y] ≤ 2x + 2y

[2k - 1] ≤ 2k ≤ 2k
Which holds true for any positive real number k. So, statement A is true. 

Option B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
This statement is not true because we have shown above that L(x,y) can be equal to R(x,y) for some values of x and y. 

Option C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
Let's try to find some values of x and y for which L(x,y) < R(x,y).
We can set x = 2.5 and y = 1.5 (or any other values that satisfy this inequality). 
L(x,y) = [2.5] + [1.5] + [4] = 2 + 1 + 4 = 7
R(x,y) = [5] + [3] = 10
Therefore, L(x,y) < R(x,y) is possible, and choice C is true.

Option D: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
This statement is not true as we have shown above that L(x,y) can be less than R(x,y) for some values of x and y.

So, the selling price of the watch is 95% of M = (95/100)*M = 0.95M.
Profit earned in this case is (0.95M - M) = 0.05M.
When the shopkeeper sells the watch by giving a discount of 7%, he earns a profit of 100% - 7% = 93%.
So, the selling price of the watch is 93% of M = (93/100)*M = 0.93M.
Profit earned in this case is (0.93M - M) = 0.07M.
The difference between the two profits is P1 - P2 = 0.05M - 0.07M = -0.02M = Rs. 15.
So, M = Rs. 15/(-0.02) = -750. 
This is a negative value, which is not possible for the marked price.

  Let's assume the marked price of the watch is ""x"".
  According to the question, the shopkeeper gave a discount of 5%, which means he sold the watch for 95% of its marked price.
  Therefore, the selling price of the watch after a 5% discount would be (95/100)*x = 0.95x.
  According to the question, if the shopkeeper gave a discount of 7%, he would earn Rs. 15 less as profit.
  So, the profit earned by selling the watch with a 5% discount is (0.95x - x * cost price percentage) = (19x / 100 - x * cost price percentage).
  And, the profit earned by selling the watch with a 7% discount is (0.93x - x * cost price percentage) = (23x / 100 - x * cost price percentage).
  Difference between profits earned on both discount = 15
  (23x / 100 - x * cost price percentage) - (19x / 100 - x * cost price percentage) = 15

  Let the marked price of the watch be M.
  The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so he sells the watch for 0.95M.
  The shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, so he sells the watch for 0.93M.
  If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. This means that the profit he makes with a discount of 7% is 15 rupees less than the profit he makes with a discount of 5%.
  We know that profit = selling price - cost price, and that the cost price is the same in both cases.
  Let P be the profit earned by the shopkeeper with a discount of 5%.
  Then, the profit earned by the shopkeeper with a discount of 7% is P - 15.

Let’s assume that the original price of the watch is x.
When the shopkeeper gives a 5% discount, he earned a profit, let say it is y.
So, he sold the watch for (x-5%) = 0.95x
Further, if he gives a 7% discount, he earns a profit of Rs. 15 less. So, the new profit will be (y-15).
Thus, the new selling price will be (x-7%) = 0.93x, and the new profit is (y-15).
Since we know that profit is the difference between the selling price and the cost price, we can equate the two expressions for profit:
0.95x - y = 0.93x - y + 15

  Then solve the equation to get x in terms of y.
  After that, we can find the length and breadth of the room.
  Using the length and breadth, we can find the area of the four walls of the room.
  Then we can find the area of the doors and windows.
  Subtracting the area of the doors and windows from the area of the four walls will give us the net area to be papered.

  Let x and y be the two numbers.
  We have two equations:
  x^2 - y^2 = (x+y)(x-y) = 256000
  x + y = 1000
  We want to solve for x and y.
  We notice that 1000 = (x + y) = (x - y) + 2y. So, we can solve for y.
  (x - y) + 2y = 1000
  x - y = 1000 - 2y
  (x + y)(x - y) = 256000
  1000(1000 - 2y) = 256000

  Profit equals the revenue from sales minus the production cost to the company.
  To calculate the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit, we need to consider the yearly revenue and the yearly production cost. 
  Yearly cost to the company = 12 (months) x 420 (units per month) x $110 (production cost per unit) = $661,440
  Yearly revenue = yearly profit + yearly production cost = $626,400 + $661,440 = $1,287,840
  To calculate the minimum selling price per component, we divide Yearly revenue by the number of units produced per year.
  Minimum selling price per component = Yearly revenue / total number of units produced per year
  Total number of units produced per year = 12 (months) x 420 (units per month) = 5,040 units
  Minimum selling price per component = $1,287,840 / 5,040 = $255.71 (rounded to the nearest cent)

To find the minimum selling price per component, we need to figure out the production cost and the revenue first. 
The production cost of 420 units of a computer component is $110 x 420 = $46,200 per month.
To find the yearly production cost, we multiply the monthly production cost by 12:
$46,200 x 12 = $554,400 per year.
The yearly profit needed is $626,400.
Therefore, the revenue needed to achieve this is:
Revenue = Production Cost + Profit
Revenue = $554,400 + $626,400
Revenue = $1,180,800
Now we can find the selling price per component:

  The company wants to make at least $626,400 yearly profit.

  The company sells 420 components each month, which means 5040 components per year.
  Let x be the minimum selling price per component that guarantees a yearly profit of $626,400.
  Then the yearly revenue from sales would be x * 5040.
  Then we can calculate the following equation to find the value of x:

To solve the problem, we need to compute the total profit for a year, given the production cost per component and the minimum selling price per component. Then, we can solve for the minimum selling price using algebra. 

Each component has a production cost of $110. Therefore, the total production cost for 420 components is: 

420 x $110 = $46,200

Let x be the minimum selling price per component.

The revenue from selling 420 components is:

420x

The total profit for a year is:

420x - $46,200

We know that the minimum yearly profit is $626,400. Therefore, we can write the following inequality:

420x - $46,200 >= $626,400

We can simplify this inequality by adding $46,200 to both sides:

420x >= $672,600

Finally, we can solve for x by dividing both sides by 420:

x >= $1601.43

Since x is the minimum selling price per component, we can round up to the nearest dollar to get the answer. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $1602.

  The value of M is a three-digit number, so it can range from 100 to 999.

  M = 100a + 10b + c
  N = 100c + 10b + a
  M - N = 99a - 99c = 99(a-c)
  Since M > N, we know that a > c.
  Thus, a-c is a positive integer.
  We are given that M - N + 396c = 990.
  This simplifies to 99(a-c) + 396c = 990, which further simplifies to 3(a-c) + 12c = 30.
  Dividing through by 3, we get a-c + 4c = 10.

  For each value of c, we get a corresponding value of M = 100a + 10b + c.
  To find the number of values of M that are greater than 300, we just need to count how many of these values are greater than 300.
  It turns out that for each value of c, there are exactly 30 values of M that are greater than 300.

  M = abc, so M is a three digit number.

  M > N implies that the hundreds digit of M, which is a, is greater than the hundreds digit of N, which is c.
  Also, M > N implies that the units digit of M, which is c, is greater than the units digit of N, which is a.
  Therefore, a > c and c > a.
  Since a and c are both digits, the only possible values for them are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9.
  We need to find how many values of M are more than 300.
  
  We can start by assuming that a = 9, since that is the largest possible value for a.
  In that case, c can be any value between 1 and 8, inclusive.
  If a = 8, then c can be any value between 1 and 7, inclusive.
  If a = 7, then c can be any value between 1 and 6, inclusive.

  If a = 4, then c can be any value between 1 and 3, inclusive.
  If a = 3, then c can be any value between 1 and 2, inclusive.
  If a = 2, then c can only be 1.

  80a - 7010 = 0

  Given M - N + 396c = 990.
  We can write  M - N = 990 - 396c
  Since M > N, M - N > 0
  So, 990 - 396c > 0
  c < 2.5
  Since c is a digit, c can be 0, 1 or 2.
  From the given statement, we have to find how many values of M are more than 300.
  Since M = abc, a must be 1, 2, or 3.
  When a = 1, b can be any digit from 0 to 9 (except c), and c can be any digit from 0 to 2.
  When a = 2, b can be any digit from 0 to 9 (except c), and c can be any digit from 0 to 1.
  When a = 3, b can be any digit from 0 to 8 (except c), and c can be 0.
  Therefore, the total number of values of M that are more than 300 is (9+8+9+8+9+1) = 44.

  We know that M = abc is a three digit number greater than N = cba.
  Therefore, a > c.
  Also, M - N + 396c = 990.
  Since a > c, we know that a and c cannot be equal to 0.
  We need to find out how many values of M are greater than 300.
  The digit 'a' can be equal to 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9.
  The digit 'b' can be equal to any of the digits from 0 to 9.
  The digit 'c' can be equal to any of the digits from 1 to 8.
  For each value of 'a', there are 10 possible values of 'b'.
  Therefore, there are 7 x 10 = 70 possible values of M.
  Now, we need to count the number of values of M that are greater than 300.
  If 'a' is equal to 3, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 3.
  If 'a' is equal to 4, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 4.
  If 'a' is equal to 5, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 5.
  If 'a' is equal to 6, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 6.
  If 'a' is equal to 7, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 7.
  If 'a' is equal to 8, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 8.
  If 'a' is equal to 9, then we can have any value of 'b' and any value of 'c' greater than 0.
  Therefore, there are 10 x 8 = 80 possible values of M when 'a' is equal to 9.
  Therefore, the total number of values of M that are greater than 300 is 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 + 80 = 560.

  Let's assume that there are ""m"" members in the family who earn less than $3000.
  The sum of their incomes is ""m"" multiplied by the maximum income they can earn, which is $2999 (since $3000 is the median).

- Profit ratio of A and B = 40,000 * 12 : 60,000 * 10 = 240:300 = 4:5
- Let the profit earned by A be 4x, then the profit earned by B is 5x.
- Total profit of A, B, and C = Profit of A + Profit of B + Profit of C = 4x + 5x + 150,000 = 9x + 150,000

Total Share of A and B = Total Profit - C's Share = Rs.375,000 - Rs.150,000 = Rs.225,000
Amount of profit earned by A and B in one year = Amount of profit earned in 2 months by A + Amount of profit earned in 10 months by B = (2/12) * total profit + (10/12) * total profit = total profit
= (1/6) * total profit + (5/6) * total profit = total profit
Let's calculate the share of A and B in the total profit:
A's Share = (2/12) * total profit = (1/6) * total profit
B's Share = (10/12) * total profit = (5/6) * total profit
Let's assume C joined the business after 'x' months.
C's Share = (10 + x)/12 * total profit = Rs.150,000
Solving for 'x':
(10 + x)/12 * total profit = Rs.150,000
(10 + x)/12 * 375,000 = 150,000
10 + x = (150,000 * 12)/375,000
10 + x = 4.8
x = 4.8 - 10 = -5.2
Since 'x' cannot be negative, this is not possible.
Therefore, C joined the business after 4 months. 
The answer is B: 4 months.

  A is a member of the business for the entire year.
  B joined after 2 months, so he was a member of the business for 10 months.
  C's profit share is Rs.150,000, so his fractional share is 150000/375000 = 2/5.
  Let x be the number of months C was a member of the business.
  Since A was a member of the business for the entire year, his share of the profit is (12/12) = 1.
  Since B joined after 2 months, his share of the profit is (10/12) = 5/6.
  Then, the share of profit for C is (x/12).
  We know that A+B+C invested Rs. 40,000 + Rs. 60,000 + Rs. 120,000 = Rs. 220,000 in the business in total.
  The ratio of their investments is (40,000 : 60,000 : 120,000) = (1 : 3/2 : 3).
  Let's assume A's investment is 2k.
  Then B's investment is (3/2)k and C's investment is 3k.
  Using the ratio of their investments, we can calculate the profit share of A and B as follows:
  A's profit share = (2k/220k) * Rs.375,000 = Rs.3,409.09
  B's profit share = [(3/2)k/220k] * Rs.375,000 = Rs.5,113.64
  We can use the above information to create an equation in x to solve for x:
  (x/12) = (2/5) * (375,000 - 3,409.09 - 5,113.64)
  (x/12) = 122,045.45 / 5
  x = 12 * (122,045.45 / 5) / 37500
  x = 23.28 months

Let's first find the value of the greatest integer. If the sum of k consecutive integers is 51 and the least integer is -50, then we can calculate the greatest integer as follows:

Sum = (n/2)[2a + (n-1)d]

k = [50 +/- sqrt(2500 - 408)]/2

  Let's use the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of integers, a is the first integer, and d is the common difference between the integers.
  We know that a = -50, so let's plug that in.
  sum = (k/2)(-100 + (k-1)d) = 51
  We need to find k.
  Let's try the answer choices backwards by substituting each value for k and solving for d.
  
  Answer (E): k = 102
    sum = (102/2) * (-100 + 101d) = 51
    51 = -51 + 5151d
    d = 2
    This means the integers are: -50, -48, -46, ..., 49, 51
    There are 103 integers, which doesn't match with k = 102, so E is incorrect.
  
  Answer (D): k = 92
    sum = (92/2) * (-100 + 91d) = 51

  Let's call the number of consecutive integers k.
  Let's call the first (or the least) integer x.
  We know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51.
  We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = (n/2) * (a1 + an), where n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the nth term.
  We know that a1 = x, and the nth term is x + (k - 1), since the integers are consecutive.
  We can substitute these values into the formula.
  51 = (k/2) * (x + x + k - 1)
  51 = (k/2) * (2x + k - 1)
  51 = kx + (k^2 - k)/2
  102 = 2kx + k^2 - k
  102 = k(2x + k - 1)
  Since we know x = -50, we can substitute that in.
  102 = k(-100 + k - 1)
  102 = k(k - 101)
  k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0
  We can solve for k using the quadratic formula:
  k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4*1*102)) / 2

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
sum = (k/2)(2a + (k-1)d)
where
  sum is the sum of the k consecutive integers,
  a is the first term of the sequence,
  d is the common difference between consecutive terms.

In this problem,
  k consecutive integers have a first term of -50, so a = -50.
  The sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, so sum = 51.
  The common difference between consecutive terms is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
  51 = (k/2)(2(-50) + (k-1)1)
  51 = -k^2 + k + 100
  k^2 - k - 49 = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get:
  k = (1 ± sqrt(1 + 196))/2
  k = (1 ± 14)/2
  k = 7 or k = -6

Since k has to be a positive integer, the only possible value is:
  k = 7

- Substituting this value in x = l + 4, we get x = l + 4 = l + 4(140/l).
- Now, we can find the perimeter of the original square by substituting the value of x in 4x = 4l + 16.

Let's say the original side of the square cloth is x. Then, the sides of the rectangular piece would be (x-4) and x. The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally into two triangles, which means that the base and height of each triangle are (x-4) and (x/2), respectively. Since the area of each triangle is 70 square feet, we can set up an equation to solve for x using the area formula of a triangle: area = 1/2 * base * height. 
  Area of each triangle = (1/2)(x-4)(x/2) = 70

  If the area of each of the triangle is 70 square feet, then the area of the rectangular piece is 140 square feet.
  Let x be the length of the rectangular piece and y be the width, then we have:
  x * (y + 4) = 140  ---> x * y + 4x = 140
  The rectangular piece is then cut diagonally in half to form two right triangles. 
  Let z be the length of the hypotenuse of each triangle, then we have:
  (1/2) * x^2 + y^2 = z^2  --->  x^2 + 2y^2 = 4z^2
  We need to find the original perimeter, which is 4x since the original piece is a square.
  We can use the first equation to solve for y in terms of x, then substitute it into the second equation to solve for x in terms of z.
  After that, we can substitute x and y back into the first equation to solve for z.

  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is 0.5 * (base * height).
  Therefore, 0.5 * (b * h) = 70.
  b * h = 140.
  The original square piece of cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece.
  Let's assume the original side of the square was x feet.
  After we trim 4 feet, the length of the rectangular piece will be x-4 feet.
  The width of the rectangular piece will be the same as the original side of the square, which is x feet.
  The diagonal of the rectangular piece is the hypotenuse of the two triangles.
  Let's apply Pythagoras theorem to calculate the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
    diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
    diagonal^2 = x^2 - 8x + 16 + x^2
    diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
    diagonal^2 = 2(x^2 - 4x + 8)
    diagonal = sqrt(2) * sqrt(x^2 - 4x + 8)
  The perimeter of the original square piece of cloth is 4 times the side x.
  Therefore, we need to find x to calculate the perimeter.

Calculation:
  b * h = 140.
  (x-4) * x = 140.
  x^2 - 4x - 140 = 0.
  (x-14) * (x+10) = 0.
  x = 14 feet (positive value).
  diagonal = sqrt(2) * sqrt(14^2 - 4*14 + 8) = 2*sqrt(170) feet (rounded to two decimal places)

gpt-35-turbo,chain_of_thought,aqua-rat-100,0.8,60,9,"Thought: 
Let's consider the original square piece of cloth to have sides of length x feet.
After trimming 4 feet on one edge, the rectangular piece would have dimensions (x-4) feet and x feet.
We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece: 
  diagonal^2 = (x-4)^2 + x^2
             = 2x^2 - 8x + 16 
Then, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle: 
  area = 0.5 * base * height
  70 = 0.5 * (x-4) * (diagonal/2)
  diagonal = sqrt(560/(x-4))
We can now substitute the expression for diagonal into the expression we found earlier: 
  diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16 
  560/(x-4) = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  280/(x-4) = x^2 - 4x + 8
  x^3 - 12x^2 + 52x - 64 = 0
One factor of this polynomial is (x-4), which corresponds to the trimmed edge. Dividing the polynomial by (x-4) yields a quadratic factor: x^2 - 8x + 16. Factoring this quadratic gives (x-4)^2. Therefore, the only solution to the cubic equation is x=4, which means our original square had sides of length 4+4 = 8 feet.
The perimeter of the square would be 4 * 8 = 32 feet.

  Let the length and width of the rectangle be l and w, respectively.
  The unpainted side is either l or w.
  If the unpainted side is l, then the sum of the painted sides is 2w + l = 37.
  If the unpainted side is w, then the sum of the painted sides is 2l + w = 37.
  The problem does not specify which side is unpainted, so we need to solve both cases.
  If 2w + l = 37, then l = 37 - 2w. Substituting into the area formula gives A = lw = w(37 - 2w) = 37w - 2w^2.
  If 2l + w = 37, then w = 37 - 2l. Substituting into the area formula gives A = lw = l(37 - 2l) = 37l - 2l^2.
  We can find the value of w or l by using the fact that the unpainted side has length 9 feet.
  If the unpainted side is l, then w = (37 - l)/2. Substituting into the equation l = w + 9 gives l = (37 - l)/2 + 9, which simplifies to l = 17.
  If the unpainted side is w, then l = (37 - w)/2. Substituting into the equation w = l + 9 gives w = (37 - w)/2 + 9, which simplifies to w = 14.

  Let's use the formula:  rate x time = work done
  We can express the work done in terms of the pool size, which is 1.
  In the 3 hours that both hoses worked together, their combined rate is 1/8 + 1/x = 1/3.
  Solving for x, we get x = 24/5.

  Hose A filled the pool alone for 2 hours.
  Therefore, the fraction of the pool filled by Hose A is 2/8 = 1/4.
  The two hoses then worked together to fill the remaining 3/4 of the pool, which took 3 hours.
  Let x be the number of hours it would have taken Hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool.
  Hose B's rate of filling the pool is b.
  Hose A's rate of filling the pool is 1/8 (since it fills the entire pool in 8 hours).
  Working together, hoses A and B can fill 3/4 of the pool in 3 hours, so their combined rate of filling the pool is (3/4)/(3) = 1/4.
  Using the formula: rate = work / time, we can write the equation:
  (1/8) * 2 + (1/4 + b) * 3 = 1 (where 1 represents the entire pool)
  Solve for b:
  (1/8) * 2 + (1/4 + b) * 3 = 1
  1/4 + 3b/4 = 5/8
  3b/4 = 1/8
  b = 1/24

  Let the capacity of the pool be C.
  Let the rate of hose A be R_a and the rate of hose B be R_b.
  From ""Hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours"", we have an equation: R_a * 8 = C.
  For the first 2 hours, the amount of water filled by hose A alone is R_a * 2.
  For the next 3 hours, the amount of water filled by both hoses working together is (R_a + R_b) * 3.
  We know that the pool is completely filled at the end, so we can set up another equation: R_a * 2 + (R_a + R_b) * 3 = C.
  We need to solve for R_b to answer the question.
  Simplifying the second equation, we get: R_b = (C - 10R_a) / 9.
  Substituting R_a * 8 = C into the expression for R_b, we get: R_b = (8R_a) / 9.
  Therefore, the time it takes for hose B to fill the pool is: C / R_b = C / ((8/9)R_a) = 9/8 * 8 = 9 hours.

  In 2001, 300 deer were caught, tagged and returned. Therefore, the total number of deer in the forest was 300/x, where x is the proportion of deer in the forest that were caught, tagged and returned in 2001.
  In 2002, 20 tagged deer were discovered in a sample of 500, so the proportion of deer with tags in the forest was 20/500.
  We can set up the proportion (300/x)=(20/500) and solve for x.

  In 2002, 20 of the 500 deer caught were already tagged from the previous year. Therefore, 480 deer caught in 2002 were not tagged initially.
  If the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the total deer population, then we can set up the following equation:
  (number of tagged deer in 2002) / (total number of deer in 2002) = (number of tagged deer in total population) / (total number of deer in total population)
  We can express the number of tagged deer in 2002 as the sum of tagged deer from 2001 that are still alive and tagged deer from 2002:

  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of Jack's, or 1/20 of Jack's rate.
  If Jill completes one-third of the job, which is equal to Jack's remaining work, she does 1/20 of the work per hour.

From the given information, we can create two equations as follows:

  x + y = total number of coins
We need to find the minimum number of copper coins.
The value of x affects the value of y.
We can start by testing the lowest possible value of x, which is x = 1, and then increase it if needed.

Let's test for x = 1:
  0.20(1) + 0.25y = 3.40
  0.25y = 3.20
  y = 12.8
Since we can't have a fractional number of coins, this doesn't work.

  0.25y = 3.00

  Let's assume the number of copper coins is ""C"" and the number of brass coins is ""B"".
  Each copper coin brings in 0.20 dollars.
  Each brass coin brings in 0.25 dollars.
  The total amount collected from copper coins is 0.20C dollars.
  The total amount collected from brass coins is 0.25B dollars.
  The total amount earned from one dive is 3.40 dollars.
  So, we can form an equation; 0.20C + 0.25B = 3.40.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins. Therefore, we should try to find the maximum number of brass coins.
  Let us see how many brass coins can we get at max. 
  When C = 0, then 0.25B = 3.4, and B = 13.6/0.25 = 54.4. It can't be a fraction. Therefore, B = 54.
  Now, using the equation, 0.20C + 0.25B = 3.40, we get C = (3.40-0.25B)/0.20 = (3.40-(0.25*54))/0.20 = 2.

- From the problem, we know that:
  x + y + z = 17 (equation 1)
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109 (equation 2)
- We also know that the original number is 100x + 10y + z, and the reversed number is 100z + 10y + x, so:
  100x + 10y + z - 495 = 100z + 10y + x
  99x - 99z = 495
  x - z = 5 (equation 3)
- Using equation 1 and equation 3, we can solve for x and z in terms of y:
  x + y + z = 17
  x - z = 5
  2x + y = 22
  x = (22 - y)/2
  z = (y - 12)/2
- We can substitute these expressions for x and z into equation 2 to get an equation in terms of y:
  (22 - y)^2/4 + y^2 + (y - 12)^2/4 = 109
  y^2 - 11y + 10 = 0
  (y - 1)(y - 10) = 0
  y = 1 or y = 10
- If y = 1, then x = 10 and z = -4, which is not possible since z must be a digit between 0 and 9.

  Now, let's try to find the time when they meet for the second time.
  Let's say they meet for the second time ""x"" km away from Y.
  At that point, Allen would have traveled (d-x+x) = d km and Bob would have traveled (d+x) km.
  The time it takes for them to meet for the second time can be found using the formula: t = distance/speed.

- When they meet for the first time, the sum of their distances traveled equals d, so we can write the equation: 54t + 78t = d.
- We know that they both covered equal distances from X to Y before they met for the first time, so each covered d/2 km.
- Once they meet for the first time, Allen has covered d/2 km and Bob has covered d/2 + 48 km. 
- Let's call the time they take to meet for the second time ""t2"" (in hours).
- When they meet for the second time, the sum of Allen's distances traveled equals Bob's distance traveled plus 48 km, so we can write the equation: 54t2 = 78t2 + d/2 + 48.
- We can simplify this equation to: 24t2 = d/2 + 48.
- We can substitute the first equation into the second and simplify:
    24t2 = (54t + 78t)/2 + 48
    24t2 = 66t + 48
    24t2 - 66t - 48 = 0

  Let the distance travelled by Bob on the second leg be d4 km.
  The distance between them would become smaller by (54+78) = 132 km every hour.
  Therefore, (d - d1 + d2) = 132 t1
  Also, (d - d4 + d3) = 132 t2
  Bob covers 48 km more than Allen in the same amount of time, so (d4-d2) = 48
  Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can find the value of t1 and t2.
  By substituting the value of t1 and t2, we can find the distance between X and Y.

  Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is 'd' km.
  Let's also assume that they meet for the second time after 't' hours.
  When they first meet, the sum of the distances covered by both of them is equal to 'd'.
  When Allen reaches Y and returns to X, he travels 2d km.
  When Bob reaches X and returns to Y, he travels 2d km.
  The total distance covered by Allen is 2d km and the time he takes is (2d / 54) = (d / 27) hours.
  The total distance covered by Bob is 2d + 48 km and the time he takes is (2d + 48) / 78 hours.
  Since they both meet for the second time at the same time, we can equate their times.
  Therefore, (d / 27) + [(2d + 48) / 78] = t.
  Simplifying the above equation we get, 10d + 1296 = 26t.
  But, we know that they meet for the second time at d/3 km away from Y towards X.
  Using this information and the relative speed of both of them, we can get another equation.
  (d/3) = (78t - 48) - (54t)

  Let's call the distance between X and Y as 'd'. 
  Allen covers distance 'd' twice (to and fro), and Bob covers the same distance once (from Y to X). 
  Let's assume they meet for the second time at a distance 'x' from X and 'y' from Y.
  When they meet for the first time, their combined distance is 'd'. 
  Using the formula time = distance / speed, we can find the time they take to meet for the first time.
  Let's call this time 't'. 
  Then, we can find the distance that Allen covers in this time 't' using his speed, which is 54 kmph.
  We can also find the distance that Bob covers in the same time 't' using his speed, which is 78 kmph.
  The total distance covered by both of them in the first meeting is 'd' = (54t + 78t).
  Similarly, we can find the total distance they cover in the second meeting, which is 'd-x+y' = (54t + 78t + 78t).
  Also, we know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen when they meet for the second time.
  We can equate the distances covered by Allen and Bob in the second meeting and solve for 'x' and 'y'.
  Finally, we can add 'x' and 'y' to get the distance 'd' between X and Y.
  
Working:
  Total distance covered in the first meeting = d
  Let t be the time taken to meet for the first time.
  Distance covered by Allen in the first meeting = 54t
  Distance covered by Bob in the first meeting = 78t
  Total distance covered in the second meeting = d + x + y
  Distance covered by Allen in the second meeting = 54t + 54t = 108t
  Distance covered by Bob in the second meeting = 78t + 48 km (given)
  Equating the distances covered in the second meeting:
    108t + x + y = 78t + 48 + d - x + d - y
    => 108t = 156t - 2d + 48
    => 48t = 2d - 48
    => 24t = d - 24
  Adding x and y, we get:
    d = x + y
    => d = (54t + 78t + 78t - 48) / 2
    => d = (156t - 48) / 2
    => d = 54t + 78
  Substituting the value of 't' from above, we get:
    d = 54(d - 24) / 24 + 78
    => 24d = 54d - 1296 + 1872

  Train N travels for 2 hours less than train M.
  Therefore, the two trains meet 2 hours after train N departs from City B, which is at 9 am.

  The two trains will cross each other when their total distance is equal to the distance between the two cities.
  Let's call the time for which the two trains travel together as t.
  The speed of train M is the distance between the two cities divided by 4.
  The speed of train N is the distance between the two cities divided by 3.5.
  Using the formula Distance = Speed x Time, we can write:
  Distance covered by Train M in t hours + Distance covered by Train N in t hours = Distance between City A and City B
  Solving this equation for t, we get t = (2/15) hours = 8 minutes.

  Train M leaves City A at 5am and arrives at City B at 9am, so its travel time is 4 hours.
  Train N leaves City B at 7am and arrives at City A at 10:30am, so its travel time is 3.5 hours.
  Let's say the two trains cross each other after t hours of Train N's travel time and before (4 + t) hours of Train M's travel time.
  Since the distance between the two cities is constant, we can set up an equation:
  Distance covered by Train M = Distance covered by Train N
  => (Speed of Train M) x (4 + t) = (Speed of Train N) x t
  We know that Train N travels for 3.5 hours and Train M for 4 hours, so we can solve for t:
  (Speed of Train M) x (4 + t) = (Speed of Train N) x t
  => (Speed of Train M) x 4 + (Speed of Train M) x t = (Speed of Train N) x t
  => (Speed of Train M) x 4 = (Speed of Train N) x t - (Speed of Train M) x t
  => (Speed of Train M) x 4 = t x ((Speed of Train N) - (Speed of Train M))
  => t = (Speed of Train M) x 4 / ((Speed of Train N) - (Speed of Train M))
  We don't know the exact speed of the trains, but we know that the relative speed of the trains is the sum of their speeds:
  Relative speed = (Speed of Train M) + (Speed of Train N)
  Therefore, we can solve for t using the relative speeds:
  t = (Speed of Train M) x 4 / ((Speed of Train M) + (Speed of Train N))
  We can substitute the given values to get the answer.
Calculation:
  Relative speed = Speed of Train M + Speed of Train N
  => Relative speed = 4 / 4.5 + 3.5 / 4.5 (unit: hours)
  => Relative speed = 8 / 9 (unit: hours/hour)
  Time taken to cross each other = (Speed of Train M) * 4 / (Relative speed)

  Let's assume that the two trains meet at time T hours after 5 am when train M started its journey.
  Train M would have travelled for T hours when the two trains meet.
  Train N would have travelled for (T - 2) hours when the two trains meet (since it started 2 hours later than train M).
  The distance travelled by both the trains when they meet is the same.
  Distance travelled by train M = speed of train M x time taken by train M = d1 = speed of train N x (T-2)
  Distance travelled by train N = speed of train N x time taken by train N = d2 = speed of train M x T
  From the above two equations, we can form an equation in one variable and solve for T.

Calculation:
  Speed of train M = d1 / (T-2)
  Speed of train N = d2 / T
  d1 = d2
  d1 / (T-2) = d2 / T
  (T x d1) - 2d1 = T x d2
  T x d1 - T x d2 = 2d1
  T = 2d1 / (d1 - d2)
  d1 = 2 x speed of train M x 4 = 8 x speed of train M

  T = 2 x 8 x speed of train M / (8 x speed of train M - 3.5 x speed of train N)

- Since the new mixture also contains an equal quantity of clay, the amount of clay in the mixture is also 5 kg.
- Initially, the amount of sand in the mixture was 0.3*10 = 3 kg.
- This means that we need to add 2 kg of pure sand (5 kg - 3 kg) to the mixture.
- Since we add x kg of sand and remove x kg of the initial mixture, the net change in the amount of sand in the mixture is 2 kg.
- Therefore, the fraction of the mixture that needs to be replaced is 2/10 = 1/5.
- We need to replace this fraction with pure sand, so the amount of the mixture that needs to be removed and replaced is (1/5)*10 = 2 kg.
- Therefore, we need to remove 2 kg of the initial mixture and replace it with 2 kg of pure sand.

  The current mixture is 30% sand and 70% clay.
  We want to make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay i.e. 50% sand and 50% clay.
  Let the amount of mixture to be removed be x kg.
  The amount of sand to be removed = 0.3x
  The amount of clay to be removed = 0.7x
  The amount of sand remaining in the mixture = 0.3(10-x)
  The amount of clay remaining in the mixture = 0.7(10-x)
  We want the remaining mixture to have 50% sand and 50% clay.

We want equal parts of clay and sand in the final mixture, so we want (7 - 0.3x) = (3 - 0.7x). Solving this equation, we get x = 20/7 kg.

  We need to find the area of the rectangular plot to calculate the cost of gardening.
  The area of the rectangular plot is L * W.
  We know that the boundary is 1-metre broad, so the new length and width of the rectangular plot will be L + 2 and W + 2, respectively.

  The area of the rectangular plot with a 1-metre boundary can be calculated as (L+2) x (W+2).
  Subtracting the area of the rectangular plot from the area of the rectangular plot with a 1-metre boundary will give us the area of the 1-metre boundary.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-metre boundary can be calculated as the area of the 1-metre boundary multiplied by the cost per square metre.
  We can simplify the calculation by solving for one of the sides first.
  From L+W = 170, we get L = 170 - W.
  Substituting this into the area equation, we get A = (L+2)(W+2) - LW = 4W + 2L + 4.
  Substituting L = 170 - W, we get A = 6W + 676.

  P' = 2(L+1+W+1) = 2(L+W+2) = 2(170+2) = 344.
  The length of the rectangular plot with 1-meter broad boundary = L + 2.

  Area of the rectangular plot with 1-meter broad boundary = (L+2)(W+2).

  The length of fencing required to surround the rectangular plot is (2L + 2W + 2) meters.
  The length of fencing required for the boundary only is [(L+2) + (W+2) + (L+2) + (W+2)] meters = 2L + 2W + 8 meters.

  Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 2(L+W) = 340m
  L+W = 170m
  Let's say that the width of the boundary is B.
  Therefore, the length of the rectangular plot including the boundary = L+2B and the width = W+2B.
  Perimeter of the rectangular plot including the boundary = 2(L+2B + W+2B) = 2(L+W+4B) = 2(170+4B) = 340+8B
  We need to find the area of the boundary which is (L+2B)(W+2B) - LW.
  Area of the boundary = (LW + 2BL + 2BW + 4B^2) - LW = 2BL + 2BW + 4B^2
  We know that the area of the boundary is (L+2B)(W+2B) - LW.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot is (2BL + 2BW + 4B^2) x 10

  Using the perimeter equation (L+W = 170), we can solve for L and W.
  L = 170 - W
  Substituting L = 170 - W into perimeter equation gives:
  2(170 - W + W) = 340

  Using the area of boundary equation, we can get the area of the boundary:

  Area of the boundary = 2(170-2B)B + 4B^2
  Area of the boundary = 340B - 4B^2

  Finally, the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot is:

  Cost = (340B - 4B^2) x 10
  Cost = 3400B - 40B^2

  We need to find the value of B to find the cost of gardening. We can use the quadratic formula (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) to solve for B.
  From our equation, a = -40, b = 3400, and c = 0.
  B = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
  B = (-3400 ± sqrt(3400^2 - 4(-40)(0))) / 2(-40) = 42.5 or 0
  
  We cannot have a value of 0 for B since we are looking for a 1-meter broad boundary. Therefore, we choose B = 42.5
  Cost = 3400(42.5) - 40(42.5)^2 = 144125
  Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around a rectangular plot is $144125.

  Let's consider the rectangular plot with length l and breadth b.
  Perimeter of rectangular plot = 2(l+b)
  Perimeter of given rectangular plot = 340
  Therefore, 2(l+b) = 340
  l+b = 170
  Also, we need to find the cost for gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The length of the rectangular plot with the boundary would be (l+2) and the breadth would be (b+2).
  Therefore, the area of the garden = (l+2) × (b+2) - lb
  Cost of gardening = 10 times the area of the garden
  Substituting l+b=170, we can solve for l and b
  l = 170 - b
  Area of the garden = (l+2) × (b+2) - lb 
                       = (170-b+2) × (b+2) - b(170-b)
                       = 2b + 174
  Cost of gardening = 10 × (2b+174)
                    = 20b + 1740
  To find b, we need l. We can solve for b by substituting l=170-b
  Area of the garden = (l+2) × (b+2) - lb 
                       = (b+2) × (172-b)
  Differentiating for the maximum value of the area, we get b=85.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening = 20 × 85 + 1740 = 3440.
  The answer is C: 3440.

  Let's assume the length and breadth of the rectangular plot be L and B respectively.
  Perimeter of the rectangular plot = 2(L+B) = 340 meters
  L+B = 170 ----------------- (Equation 1)
  Let's assume the breadth of the rectangular plot including the garden be b.
  Length of the rectangular plot including the garden = L+2b
  Breadth of the rectangular plot including the garden = B+2b
  Total area of the rectangular plot including the garden = (L+2b)(B+2b)
  Area of the rectangular plot = LB
  Area of the garden = Total area of the rectangular plot including garden - Area of the rectangular plot
                            = (L+2b)(B+2b) - LB
                            = 2b(L+B) + 4b^2
                            = 2b(170) + 4b^2
                            = 340b + 4b^2
  Cost of gardening 1 square meter = Rs.10
  Cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot (i.e., garden of breadth b) = Cost of gardening the area of the garden

  We don't have the value of b. We need to express b in terms of L and B using Equation 1.
  B = 170 - L
  Also, the breadth of the rectangular plot cannot be negative.
  Therefore, 0 < b < (170-L)/2
  We can substitute the value of B in the expression for the area of the garden.
  Area of the garden = 340b + 4b^2
                            = 340(170-L)/2 + 2(170-L)^2
                            = 85(170-L) + 2(28900 - 340L + L^2)

                            = 2L^2 - 765L + 57950

  Let's start by drawing a diagram.
  Let d be the distance between A and B.
  Let t1 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B.
  Let t2 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A.
  We can use the formula d = r × t (where r is the speed and t is the time) to relate the distance, speed, and time.
  According to the problem, Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, and at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A.
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he has already driven (d - 70) miles towards B.
  We can use this information to set up an equation involving d, t1, and t2.
  From the equation, we can solve for d, which is the distance we want to find.
  Let's do this step-by-step.

Action:
  Let d be the distance between A and B in miles.
  Let t1 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B in hours.
  Let t2 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A in hours.
  We know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, so we can write:
  d = 70t1   (equation 1)
  We also know that Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, so we can write:
  d = 90t2   (equation 2)
  We know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that he has already driven (d - 70) miles towards B.
  We can use this information to set up another equation:
  (d - 70) = 70(t2 - 3)   (equation 3)
  We want to find the value of d. To do this, we need to eliminate t1 and t2 from the equations.
  We can solve equation 1 for t1 and substitute it into equation 3:
  t1 = d/70
  (d - 70) = 70(t2 - 3)
  (d - 70) = 70(d/90 - 3)
  (d - 70) = (7/9)d - 210
  (16/9)d = 280
  d = 157.5
  Therefore, the distance between A and B is 157.5 miles.

  The total time for his trip was x/70 + x/90 hours.
  Therefore, (2x-70)/90 = (x/70 + x/90) - 3
  Solving for x, we get x=270.

  Let d be the distance between A and B.
  Let t1 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from A to B.
  Let t2 be the time it takes Kevin to drive from B to A.
  We know that d=rt1 and d=rt2 where r is the speed of Kevin.
  Kevin drove at 70mph from A to B, so t1=d/70.
  Kevin drove at 90mph from B to A, so t2=d/90.
  Kevin was still approaching B, 3 hours before the end of his trip, which means he was 70 miles away from B. 
  Therefore, he has already driven 70 miles of the distance between B and A.
  We can express the total time of the trip as T=t1+t2.
  We are given that T-3=t2, which means t1=T-3.
  We can substitute t1 in terms of T and solve for d.
  d/70 + d/90 = T
  d = 630T / 16
  
  To find T we can use the fact that Kevin still had 70 miles to go 3 hours before the end of his trip.
  t2 - 3 = 70/90
  d/90 - 3 = 7/9
  d/90 = 25/9

  The time he took to go from B to A at 90 mph is t2 = d/90.
  The total time taken for the whole trip is t = t1 + t2.
  Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  Therefore, at time (t - 3), he was 70 miles away from B.
  At time (t - 3), he had traveled (70 + d) miles (d miles to reach B and 70 miles from B).
  Applying the formula, distance = rate x time, we get

  The time he used from A to B is t1 = d/70.
  Once he turned around, the time he used from B to A is t2 = d/90.
  Three hours before the end of the trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  That means, he spent (t1 + t2 - 3) hours to travel from B to 70 miles away from B.

  Let t2 be the time it took Kevin to return from B to A.
  We know that Kevin drove at 70 mph from A to B and at 90 mph from B to A.
  Therefore, we can write two equations: d = 70t1 and d = 90t2.
  We also know that 3 hours before the end of the trip, Kevin was only 70 miles away from B.
  This means that at this point, he had already traveled 3t1 - 70 miles.
  Since he still had the same distance to travel from B to A, he would travel the remaining distance at 90 mph.
  We can write another equation: 70 = (t2 - 3) * 90.
  We can use the first two equations to solve for t1 and t2 in terms of d.
  Then we can substitute these expressions into the third equation to solve for d.

Calculation:
  From d = 70t1 and d = 90t2, we have t1 = d/70 and t2 = d/90.
  Substituting these expressions into 70 = (t2 - 3) * 90, we get:

  Let's assume the distance between A and B is d miles.
  The time it took Kevin to reach point B from point A is t1 = d / 70.
  The time it took Kevin to reach point A from point B is t2 = d / 90.
  The total time Kevin spent on the trip is t1 + t2.
  3 hours before the end of his trip, the distance between Kevin and point B was 70 miles.
  Using the time it took him to travel the 70 miles (3 hours) before the end of his trip, we can find how far Kevin was from point B when he first passed it.
  The time it took Kevin to travel the distance d + 70 miles was t1 + t2 - 3.
  Let's represent the distance between the point where Kevin first passed B and point A with x.
  Then, we can create an equation:
  x + 70 = 90(t1 + t2 - 3) 
  We also know that t1 + t2 = (d / 70) + (d / 90)
  We can simplify the equation as follows:
  x = (7d / 9) - 210
  
  To find the distance d between A and B, we need to find x + d.
  x + d = (7d / 9) - 210 + d = (16d / 9) - 210.
  We know that x + d is equal to the distance between A and B.

  We can solve the equation (16d / 9) - 210 = d to find the distance between A and B.
  (16d / 9) - d = 210
  (7d / 9) = 210
  d = 270

  Let's assume the distance between A and B is ""d"".
  Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph, which means it will take him d/70 hours to reach point B.
  Kevin's speeds on the way to B and back are different. Hence, let's assume the time he took to reach the point 70 miles away from B as ""t"" hours.
  Kevin was exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip when he was still approaching B, which means he took (d-70)/90 hours to travel from 70 miles away from B to A.
  Kevin's total trip time is (d/70) + (d-70)/90, which is greater than 3 hours.
  Therefore, the sum of the time it took Kevin to travel from A to B and the time it took him to travel from B to 70 miles away from B is equal to the total trip time minus three hours.
  So, (d/70) + (70/(90)) = (d/70) + (d-70)/90 - 3.

  We also know that Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph, so we have d = 90t2.
  We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B, so he had traveled a total distance of d+70.
  We can set up the equation (d+70) = 70(t1+t2-3) since he had 3 hours remaining for the trip at that point.
  We can then substitute d = 70t1 and d = 90t2 into the equation to get 70t1 + 70t2 - 3*70 = 90t2 + 70t1.

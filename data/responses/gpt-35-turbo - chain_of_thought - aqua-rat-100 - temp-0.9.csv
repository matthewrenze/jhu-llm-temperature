For a pair (x,y) to be valid under the routine, y must be less than or equal to the square root of x.
Let's check each option:
A: x=99, y=10 which is valid since 10 is less than or equal to sqrt(99).
B: x=85, y=9 which is valid since 9 is less than or equal to sqrt(85).
C: x=50, y=7 which is valid since 7 is less than or equal to sqrt(50).
D: x=1, y=1 which is valid since 1 is equal to sqrt(1).
E: x=1, y=0 which is not valid, because 0 is not less than or equal to sqrt(1).

- (99, 10): the square root of 99 is 9.95 which is greater than 10, so this pair does NOT satisfy the routine. 
- (85, 9): the square root of 85 is approximately 9.22 which is less than or equal to 9, so this pair satisfies the routine.
- (50, 7): the square root of 50 is approximately 7.07 which is less than or equal to 7, so this pair satisfies the routine. 
- (1, 1): the square root of 1 is equal to 1, so this pair satisfies the routine. 
- (1, 0): the second number, y, should be less than or equal to the square root of x. In this case, x=1, and the square root of 1 is 1, so y=0 is also valid. So this pair satisfies the routine.

  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, that is 75 employees. This means 25 employees didn't take a winter vacation.
  If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, that is 40 employees. This means 60 employees left that only took a winter vacation or only took a summer vacation.
  If 20% of employees take neither winter nor summer vacation, that is 20 employees. This means 80 took at least one vacation.
  Let A be the number of employees that took only a winter vacation. 
  Let B be the number of employees that took only a summer vacation.
  The number of employees that took a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is B - 40.

  B+(B-40) = Q => 2B = Q+40 => B = Q/2 + 20
  A+B = 40 => A+Q/2 + 20 = 40 => A+Q/2 = 20 => A = 40-Q/2
  The number of employees that took only a summer vacation is B-40 = Q/2 - 20.

  The longest distance through the solid will be the diameter of the sphere that it's inscribed in.
  The longest distance will be a diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the diagonal.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle with legs a, b, and hypotenuse c, a^2 + b^2 = c^2.
  In this case, a = 3, b = 4, and c is the diagonal we're trying to find.
  The length of the diagonal is sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2) = sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10).
  The diameter of the sphere is the same as the length of the diagonal.

To determine how many helpers are required, we need to determine how many large and small cakes can be produced within 3 hours.
One helper can make 2 large cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make: 2 * 3 = 6 large cakes.
One helper can make 35 small cakes per hour, so in 3 hours, a helper can make: 35 * 3 = 105 small cakes.
Let's find out how many cakes can be made with all the helpers within 3 hours.
Assuming h is the number of helpers, then in 3 hours, the total large cakes that can be made are: 2 * 3 * h = 6h.
And, in 3 hours, the total small cakes that can be made are: 35 * 3 * h = 105h.
We need 20 large cakes. Hence, 6h >= 20, so h >= 20/6 which is about 3.333.
We need 700 small cakes. Hence, 105h >= 700, so h >= 700/105 = 6.666.
The number of helpers required should be higher than 3.333 and 6.666. So, we need at least 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes and at least 7 helpers to make 700 small cakes.

- A total of 20 large cakes are required, thus 20 / 6 = 3.33 hours required if a helper is to make these number of cakes, which is impossible. 
- A total of 700 small cakes are required, thus 700 / 105 = 6.67 hours required if a helper is to make these number of cakes, which is impossible. 
- The task requires 20 large cakes + 700 small cakes, which is a combination of both.
- Therefore we can assume that we need a combination of helpers who can make large and small cakes.
- Let's assume x helpers that can make large cakes and y helpers that can make small cakes to meet the demand.
- We can set up the equation:
  - 2x + 35y = (20 x 2) + 700
  - 2x + 35y = 40 + 700
  - 2x + 35y = 740
- We also know that the helpers can work for 3 hours, so we can add another equation:
  - 2x + 35y <= 3*60
  - 2x + 35y <= 180
- To solve this equation, we need to use integer programming.
- Alternatively, we can guess-and-check. 
- We can begin by trying out the smallest answer: 8 helpers.
- Let x be 2 and y be 6, hence there will be 2 helpers making large cakes and 6 helpers making small cakes.
- So the total number of large cakes = 2 x 2 = 4, and the total number of small cakes = 6 x 35 = 210.
- Since (4 + 210) < (20 + 700), we need more helpers.
- Trying 10 helpers, we get x be 3 and y be 7.
- So the total number of large cakes = 3 x 2 = 6, and the total number of small cakes = 7 x 35 = 245.

  The total distance covered equals the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel.

  120 miles per hour is equal to 176 feet per second which equals 1.47 miles per second (rounded to 2 decimal places).
  Total distance covered by the train equals length of train + length of tunnel equals 1 mile + length of train.

  We know the time it takes to enter the tunnel, but we need to convert this to seconds to be consistent with our speed calculation.
  Once we have the speed and time, we can use the formula Distance = Speed × Time to calculate the length of the tunnel.
  The time taken to pass through the tunnel will be the same as the time taken to enter the tunnel, since the train is traveling at a constant speed.

  We need to calculate the length of the train in miles to know how long it will take to pass the tunnel.
  Let's first convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per second since the time given is in seconds.
  120 miles per hour = (120/60) miles per minute = 2 miles per minute = (2/60) miles per second = 1/30 miles per second.
  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the 1-mile long tunnel, so its length is (1 - 1/30) miles.
  The time it will take to pass the tunnel is equal to the time it takes to travel its length at 120 miles per hour.
  Let's convert the speed to miles per second: 120 miles per hour = (120/3600) miles per second = 1/30 miles per second.
  Therefore, the time it will take to pass the tunnel is (1 - 1/30) / (1/30) = 29 seconds.

  We know the train is traveling at 120 miles per hour and is entering a tunnel that is 1 mile long.
  We want to find out how long it will take the train to completely pass through the tunnel.
  We can start by calculating the length of the train which is the distance it covers in 3 seconds.
  The distance covered by the train in 3 seconds can be calculated as (120 miles/hour * 5280 feet/mile * 1 hour/3600 seconds) * 3 seconds = 792 feet.
  This means that the total distance covered by the train when passing through the tunnel is 1 mile (5280 feet) + the length of the train (792 feet).
  Therefore, the total distance covered by the train is 6072 feet.
  The time it takes for the train to pass through the tunnel can be calculated using the formula: time = distance / speed.
  Therefore, the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel is (6072 feet / (120 miles/hour * 5280 feet/mile * 1 hour/3600 seconds)) seconds.
  Simplifying this gives (6072 / 5280 * 120 * 3600) seconds = 33 seconds (approximately).

  Ball A makes 2 full rotations in 26 minutes. That is, Ball A takes 13 minutes to make one full rotation.
  Ball B makes 5 full rotations in 35 minutes. That is, Ball B takes 7 minutes to make one full rotation.
  We have to find the time when they meet again at the starting point. This happens when the number of full rotations made by both balls is the same, and this number is a positive integer.
  Let the number of full rotations made by both balls be x. Then, x rotations by Ball A take 13x minutes, and x rotations by Ball B take 7x minutes.
  We want to find the smallest value of x such that 13x and 7x differ by a multiple of 26 (since they started at the same point and meet at the same point after a multiple of 26 minutes).
  Let's test values of x starting from 1 until we get a difference that is a multiple of 26.
  When x=1, 13x-7x = 6, which is not a multiple of 26.
  When x=2, 13x-7x = 12, which is not a multiple of 26.
  When x=3, 13x-7x = 18, which is not a multiple of 26.
  When x=4, 13x-7x = 24, which is a multiple of 26.
  Therefore, both balls will be at the starting point again after 4 rotations.
  The time taken by Ball A for 4 rotations is 13×4=52 minutes.
  The time taken by Ball B for 4 rotations is 7×4=28 minutes.

- We can start by simplifying the equation: 29 + (x/2) = (2*29+x)/2 = (58+x)/2
- So, (58+x)/2 = total weight in kgs
- Now, we know that Silu weighs 51 Kgs.
- So, the sum of both of their weights is (58+x)/2 + 51 = (58+x+102)/2 = (x+160)/2 kgs.
- Since the sum of their weights is the total weight of both Silu and Meenu, we can equate this to x+29 kgs (which is Meenu's weight plus Silu's weight).
- So, we have the equation (x+160)/2 = x+29.

  Finally, we can calculate the length of the space shuttle using the formula; Length = Speed x Time.

  Average speed = Total distance / Total time taken
  Total distance = 700m (max height reached) + d (length of space shuttle)

  a = 15.49 or a = -15.49
  As a represents length, the negative value is irrelevant.
  Therefore, a = 15.49 meters.
  
  Substituting this back into the length of fencing required equation, we have:
  2a + 240/a = 2(15.49) + 240/15.49 = 34.98 + 15.49 = 50.47
  So Alice needs 50.47 meters of fencing.

  Let's call the length and width of the rectangular yard l and w, respectively.
  From the problem statement, we know that one side of the yard is 10 meters and the area of the yard is 240 square meters. Therefore:
  l * w = 240.
  Since the side opposite the unfenced side is part of the perimeter of the yard, we need fencing on that side as well. So, we need to find the perimeter of the three sides of the yard that will be fenced.
  The two lengths and one width of the yard will be fenced, for a total length of 2l + w - 10 meters.
  We can solve for l and w using the area equation: w = 240 / l.
  Substituting w in the expression for total length, we get: 2l + (240 / l) - 10.
  To minimize the amount of fencing needed, we should choose a value of l that makes the expression above as small as possible.
  We can do this by finding the derivative of the expression and setting it equal to zero.
  After some algebraic manipulation, we can find that l = 20 and w = 12.
  Therefore, the total length of fencing needed is 2 * 20 + 12 - 10 = 42 meters.

  Since one side is 10 meters, the total perimeter of the yard is now 2x + y + 10.
  Setting these two expressions for perimeter equal, we get 2x + y + 10 = 2x + y, which simplifies to 10 = 0, a contradiction.

  Let's assume the length of the rectangular yard is ""l"" and the width is ""w"".
  As per the question, the area of the yard is 240 sq.m. So, lw = 240 sq.m. 
  She wants to fence around three sides of her rectangular yard, which means the length of three sides she wants to fence is (2l + w).
  And, one side of 10 meters would remain unfenced, which is ""w"".
  So, the total length of fencing required = (2l + w) + w + w = 2l + 3w
  We need to find the value of (2l + 3w)
  We can find the value of ""l"" by substituting the value of ""w = 240/l"" in 2l + 3w.
  We obtain 2l + 3(240/l)
  And, lw = 240 sq.m, which means l = 240/w.
  By substituting the value of l in the above expression, we obtain 2(240/w) + 3w = 480/w + 3w = 480/w + 3(w^2)/w = 480/w + 3w
  Now, taking the derivative of the expression and equating it to zero, we can find the minimum value that the expression takes.
  We obtain w^2 - 320w + 240^2 = 0
  Since we need a positive value of ""w"", we can consider w = 80 as a valid value of ""w"".
  Hence, the value of ""l"" is 240/w = 240/80 = 3.
  The total length of fencing required = 2l + 3w = 2(3) + 3(80) = 246 meters.

  If one side of the rectangular yard is 10 meters , then the other two sides are of equal length (l).
  The area of a rectangle is the product of its length and width.
  The expression for the area of the yard is A= l * w = 240.
  We are missing information about the dimensions of the rectangle to calculate the fencing needed.
  Since there are three sides to be fenced, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle which is P= 2l + 2w.
  We can solve for w using the expression: w= A/l.
  The expression for P becomes P= 2l + 2(A/l) + 10.
  We can find the value of l by solving for the minimum value of P.
  Taking the derivative of P with respect to l and setting it equal to zero gives l = sqrt(240).
  Substituting this value of l in the expression for P gives P = 2*sqrt(240) + 50 which is approximately equal to 66 meters.

  Between 8:00 am and noon, there were 4 feeding sessions.
  Each feeding session reduces the remaining dog food to 2/3 of its previous amount.
  So the remaining dog food can be represented as (2/3)^4 of the original amount.
  (2/3)^4 is approximately 0.2 or 1/5.
  Therefore, right before the dog began to eat at noon, there was approximately 20% of the original food in the dog's bowl.

  The dog ate 4 times. 
  The dog ate once every hour for 4 hours.
  At each feeding session the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food.
  That means after one hour there was 2/3 remaining, after two hours there was 4/9, after three hours there was 8/27, and after four hours there was 16/81 food remaining.
  Therefore, right before the dog began to eat, there was 16/81 of the original food remaining.
  We can represent this percentage as: (16/81) * 100%
  We can simplify this fraction to: (16/81) * (3/3) = 48/243 which reduces to 16/81

- At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food.
- We need to find the percent of dog food remaining just before noon.
- Since the dog ate 4 times, we divide the bowl of food into 4 equal parts.
- At each feeding session, the dog ate 1/3 of the remaining food, so the total amount of food left in the bowl is (2/3)^4.

  When folded along the length L, the new dimension becomes (L/2) and the breadth is still B. 
  The perimeter of this folded sheet is given as 48 cm, therefore,
  2(L/2 + B) = 48, solving for L we get L = 48 - 2B.
  
  When folded along the breadth B, the new dimension becomes (B/2) and the length is still L.
  The perimeter of this folded sheet is given as 66 cm, therefore,
  2(L + B/2) = 66, solving for L using the expression from the first scenario we get L = 33 - B.

  Equating both expressions of L we get,
  48 - 2B = 33 - B, solving for B we get B = 15cm,
  Substituting B=15cm in the expression for L we get L = 18cm.

  Let x and y be the length and width of the rectangular sheet.
  When folded along the length to form two equal parts, each part has a perimeter of 48 cm. So, the length of each part is (48/2)/2 = 12 cm. Hence, x + y = 12.
  Similarly, when folded along the width to form two equal parts, each part has a perimeter of 66 cm. So, the width of each part is (66/2)/2 = 16.5 cm. Hence, 2x + 2y = 33 or x + y = 16.5/2 = 8.25.
  Solving the above two equations simultaneously, we get x = 5.5 cm and y = 6.5 cm.

 l = 24 - w/2

  Let's assume that the length and width of the rectangular sheet before folding be l and w, respectively.
  When folded along length, each part has a perimeter of 48cm, which means that each part's width is w/2.
  Therefore, the length of each part is 24cm (calculated as 48/2).
  When folded along width, each part has a perimeter of 66cm, which means that each part's length is l/2.
  Therefore, the width of each part is 33cm (calculated as 66/2).
  The area of the whole sheet can be calculated by multiplying length and width, which is l*w.
  We can express l in terms of w using the above calculations and vice versa.
  Once we have the equation in one variable, we can solve for it.
  Finally, we can substitute the found value back into the l*w equation to get the area of the sheet.
  Let's solve it step by step to find the answer.

Action: 
  Let's start with the perimeter when folded along length:
  2l + 2*w/2 = 48
  Simplifying the above equation, we get
  2l + w = 48

  Next, let's find perimeter when folded along width:
  2*w + 2*l/2 = 66
  Simplifying the above equation, we get
  w + l = 66/2 = 33

  Rearranging the first equation to express l in terms of w:
  l = (48 - w)/2

  Substituting the above equation into the second equation:
  w + (48 - w)/2 = 33
  Simplifying and solving for w, we get
  w = 18cm

  Substituting w = 18 into the expression for l we found earlier:
  l = (48 - 18)/2 = 15cm

  Finally, substituting the found values of l and w in the expression for the area of the sheet:
  Area = l * w = 15 * 18 = 270 cm^2

New per head cost = (xy + 16) / (x-4) = y + Rs.4 (because remaining people had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each)
Solving these two equations will give us the value of x which is the number of people who attended the picnic.

So, before the 4 people who didn't show up, the total amount they have to contribute is: 96/x.
But due to the absence of 4 people, each of the remaining 'x-4' people has to contribute an extra Rs. 4.
So, the total amount they contributed after the absence of 4 people is (96/x) + 4(x-4).
By solving the above equation, we can get the value of x, which is the number of people attended the picnic.

Let’s assume that the total number of friends who agreed to go to the picnic is N.
The cost of eatables per person would be 96/N.
But, because 4 people didn't show, the remaining (N - 4) people had to pay Rs. 4 extra, which means they paid 96/N + 4.
So, the equation will be: 96/N = 96/(N-4) + 4
We can solve this equation to get the value of N.
  96/N = 96/(N-4) + 4
  96(N-4) = 96N + 4N(N-4)  [multiplying both sides by N(N-4)]
  96N - 384 = 96N + 4N^2 - 16N  [expanding the right side]
  4N^2 - 16N - 384 = 0  [bringing all the terms to one side]
  N^2 - 4N - 96 = 0  [dividing all terms by 4]
  (N - 12)(N + 8) = 0  [factoring]

The cost for each person if all n friends had attended would have been 96/n.
Since 4 friends did not show up, the remaining n-4 friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra each.
So, the cost/person increased to (96+4(n-4))/n = (96+4n-16)/n = (4n+80)/n = 4 + 80/n
We need to find the value of n such that 4 + 80/n = 96/n.

To determine the minimum number of students in a school so that there are more than 501 students who took physics and math with the given percentages, we need to consider the scenario in which all the students who took physics also took math. This will give us the maximum possible overlap between the two groups and, thus, the minimum possible number of students in the school.

Let n be the total number of students in the school. Then, according to the problem statement, 20% of n took physics and 28% of n took math. If all of the students who took physics also took math, then the total number of students who took either physics or math (or both) is:

20% of n + (28% of n - 20% of n) = 0.28n - 0.2n + 0.2n = 0.28n

  Let's consider each option one by one.
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y] 
     As LHS is an integer sum, the RHS must also be an integer.
     But [2x] and [2y] are both even integers.
     [x] + [y] must be an even integer as well. Thus, x and y have the same fractional part.
     But in that case, [x] + [y] + [x + y] cannot be equal to [2x] + [2y]. 
     So, option A is impossible.
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
     This option is not specific. There are indeed many pairs of x and y that satisfy this. For example, x = y = 1.
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] < [2x] + [2y] 
     [x] + [y] + [x + y] is always less than or equal to [x] + [y] + [2x + 2y], which is equal to [2x] + [2y].

  And R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] can be simplified as R(a,b) = 2a + 2b - (d + e) where d and e are either 0 or 1 depending on whether {2a} and {2b} are greater than or less than 1, respectively.
  We know that a, b, and c are integers, so we need to find two numbers, a and b, that satisfy L(a,b,c) = R(a,b).
  Because c = a + b + k (where k is a decimal portion of x+y), we need to find two integers a, b, so that 2a + 2b - (d + e) = a + b + a + b + k.
  We can simplify this equation to a + b + (d + e) = 2k.
  Because a and b are integers, a + b is an even integer.

  [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Therefore, [2x] represents the same value or one less than [x] if x is not an integer, and it represents twice the value of x if x is an integer.
  For L(x,y), we can add the values of [x], [y] and [x + y]. Since each of the integers inside the brackets is either a real number itself, or a real number + 1, it is possible to find any two positive real numbers x and y that make this equation true.
  For R(x,y), we add [2x] and [2y]. It is possible to have [2x] = [x] + [x] or [2x] = [x] + [x] + 1. In either case, [2y] has the same possibilities. 
  If [2x] + [2y] = [x] + [y] + [x + y], then because both sides of the equation include only integer values, we know that there is an integer m such that 2x - m = x and 2y - m = y. Hence, x and y must be integers which contradicts the problem statement.

  Since [x], [y], and [x+y] are integers, we can conclude that [x] ≤ x, [y] ≤ y, and [x+y] ≤ (x+y).
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ x+y+2 (since [x] ≤ x, [y] ≤ y, and [x+y] ≤ (x+y))

  L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] is the sum of three integers.
  R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] is the sum of two integers.
  Let's find the relationship between L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  We know that [x] ≤ x and [y] ≤ y. Thus, [x] + [y] ≤ x + y.
  This implies that [x + y] ≤ [x] + [y] + 1.
  Therefore, [x] + [y] + [x + y] ≤ 2[x] + 2[y].
  Using this relationship, we can infer that L(x,y) ≤ R(x,y).
  Since L(x,y) cannot be greater than R(x,y), the only possibility is that L(x,y) = R(x,y) or L(x,y) < R(x,y).

  If L(x,y) = R(x,y), then [x] + [y] + [x + y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Let's consider the case where 0 < x,y < 1.
  Then [x] = [y] = 0 and [2x] = [2y] = 0.
  So, [x + y] = 0, and we have 0 = 0, which does not provide any useful information.
  Let's try another case where 1 ≤ x < 2 and 1 ≤ y < 2.

Let's assume the marked price as MP. 
According to the problem, the selling price (SP) after a 5% discount will be 95% of MP i.e., 0.95 * MP.
Similarly, the selling price (SP) after a 7% discount will be 93% of MP i.e., 0.93 * MP.
Also given that if the discount is 7%, the shopkeeper earns Rs. 15 less profit than the 5% discount situation.
Therefore, 0.05 * MP - 0.95 * MP = 0.07 * MP - 0.93 * MP - 15

  We need to find the minimum selling price per component required to make a profit of at least $626,400 annually.
  First, we need to calculate the annual production cost, which is $110 per component * 420 components per month * 12 months = $554,400.
  We need to make a profit of at least $626,400 - $554,400 = $72,000 annually.
  The revenue generated from selling one component is the minimum selling price.
  Let's assume the minimum selling price is ""x"". Then, the revenue generated from selling 420 components in one month is ""420x"".
  So the yearly revenue will be 12 * 420x = $5,040x.
  We need to make a profit of at least $72,000 annually. Therefore, we can set up the inequality: 
  $5,040x - $554,400 >= $72,000
  Solving for x:
  $5,040x >= $626,400
  x >= $626,400 / $5,040

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:
1. Calculate the yearly production cost = $110 x 420 units/month x 12 months/year = $554,400/year.
2. Calculate the yearly revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of $626,400 = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800.
3. Calculate the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly revenue is $1,180,800, selling all 420 units every month:

  minimum selling price per component = (yearly revenue) / (number of units produced per year)
  
  minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / (420 units/month x 12 months/year)
  
  minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year

  The given expression is of the form a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2.
  We can use the identity (a-b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab to simplify the given expression.
  After simplification, we will have to identify the option that matches the result.

Solution:
  Using the identity, (a - b)2 = a2 + b2 - 2ab
  We get, a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 + b2 - 2ab)/ (a+b)2
  Simplifying further, we get,
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = [(a + b)2 - 4ab]/ (a+b)2
  Canceling out (a+b)2 from numerator and denominator, we get,
  a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = 1 - 4ab/(a+b)2
  But, it is given that a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  Therefore, we have (a - b)2 = 1 - 4ab/(a+b)2
  Taking LCM on the right hand side, we get,
  (a - b)2 = [(a+b)2 - 4ab]/(a+b)2
  On solving further, we get
  (a - b)2 = (a2 + b2 - 2ab)/ (a+b)2

  By simplifying, 99a - 99c > 0, which is further simplified to a > c.
  Let's express M - N + 396c = 990 in terms of a, b, and c:
    M - N + 396c = 990

  To solve this problem, we need to use the formula distance = rate x time, where rate is the speed or velocity of the cyclist and distance is the total distance covered. We are given the rate of the cyclist as 12 miles per hour and the distance is 48 miles. To find how long it will take to travel this distance, we can rearrange the formula as time = distance / rate. When we substitute the given values, we get:
  time = 48 / 12 = 4 hours
  But the question is asking for the time in minutes, so we need to convert hours to minutes. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can multiply the number of hours by 60 to get the time in minutes. Thus:
  time in minutes = 4 x 60 = 240 minutes

To find the number of members in the family, we need to divide the total income by the median income as each member earns some amount of money.      
  If the median income is $3000, and the total income is $9000, then the number of members in the family should be 3.  
  As the median income is the income of the middle person when the incomes are arranged in ascending or descending order, and the median income is $3000, it is safe to assume that all the members earn the same amount. So, the average income of each member is $3000 / 3 = $1000.  
  Therefore, there are 3 members in the family.

  The median income refers to the income that sits in the middle when all incomes have been arranged in ascending or descending order.
  If the median income of a family is $3000 and there are ""n"" family members, then there are ""n"" incomes.
  Since the median income is $3000, this means that half of the family members earn less than $3000 and half earn more than $3000.
  Let's assume that ""m"" family members earn less than $3000. This means that ""n - m"" family members earn more than $3000.
  Therefore, the total income of the family can be expressed as:
  Total income = m * x + (n - m) * y, where x is the income of the ""m"" family members and y is the income of the remaining ""n - m"" family members.
  We know that the total income of the family per month is $9000. Therefore, we can write an equation as: m * x + (n - m) * y = 9000.
  From this equation, we can also say that m = (n + 1) / 2 (since there are ""m"" family members earning less than $3000, and assuming an odd value for ""n"").
  Let's substitute this value of ""m"" in the previous equation and simplify:
  ((n + 1) / 2) * x + ((n - (n + 1) / 2) * y) = 9000
  n * y - x / 2 = 6000
  n * y = x / 2 + 6000
  n = (x / 2 + 6000) / y
  Now, we need to find integers ""x"" and ""y"" such that ""n"" is also an integer, and the condition ""m = (n + 1) / 2"" is satisfied.
  One possible solution is x = 2000 and y = 4000. This gives n = 3, which satisfies the condition (m = 2, n = 3).

To find the number of members in a family based on the median income, we need to know the average income earned per member. 
If the median income is $3000, then there are family members earning $3000 or more and family members earning less than $3000.
We know that the total income of the family is $9000, therefore:
Let's assume there are n family members and x is the average income earned per member.
If we arrange the income earned by each family member in increasing order, then the median income can be calculated as follows:
  If n is odd, then the median income will be the middle income (i.e. (n+1)/2-th income).
	A Median income of $3000 means that the 2nd person in the arranged sequence earns $3000. 
  Hence, only one person earns $3000 or more and the rest (n-1) earn less than $3000. 
  So total monthly income earned by the family = 3000 + (n-1)*x
  But we know that the total income of the family is $9000, 
  therefore, 3000 + (n-1)*x = 9000
  (n-1)*x = 6000
  If we assume that x is an integer, then (n-1) must be a divisor of 6000.
  Also, n cannot be less than 2, as there must be at least two family members in the family.
  Let's check the options:
    B: If there are 3 family members, then their average income is x = 9000/3 = 3000. Hence, the median income will also be 3000. So, this may be the correct answer.

  Median income of $3000 means that half of the family members earn more than $3000 and the other half earn less than $3000. 
  Let x be the number of family members earning less than $3000 and y be the number of family members earning more than $3000.
  Therefore, the total number of family members would be x+y, and we need to find the value of x+y.
  Since the median income is $3000, the sum of income of (x-1)/2 members and (y-1)/2 members on one end would be $3000.
  So, the total income of (x-1)/2 members and (y-1)/2 members would be 3000*(x+y)/2.
  The remaining (x+y)-(x-1)/2-(y-1)/2=(x+y)/2+1 family members would together earn the remaining income of the family.

    A:B:C
    40,000 x 2 : 1,00,000 x (x - 2) : 1,20,000 x (x - c)
    We need to find the value of c.
  Using the ratio between the investments of A, B, and C, we get:

  Total Investment = 40000 (Investment of A) + 60000 (Investment of B) + x (Investment of C) (where x is the investment of C in Rs.)
  Let's assume that C joined the business after y months, then:
  Profit Share of A = (2/12) * (375000 - 150000) = 37500
  Profit Share of B = (y/12) * (375000 - 150000) = (y/12) * 225000
  Profit Share of C = [(12-y)/12] * (375000 - 150000) = [(12-y)/12] * 225000
  Since C got Rs. 150,000 as his share, then we can form the following equation:
  [(12-y)/12] * 225000 = 150000

  Let's call the number of months B worked before C joined as 'm'.
  A invested Rs.40,000 for the whole year, so their investment would be 40,000*12 = Rs. 480,000.
  B invested Rs.60,000 for 10 months (as he joined after 2 months), so their investment would be 60,000*10 = Rs. 600,000.
  C invested Rs.120,000 for (12-m) months, so their investment would be 120,000*(12-m) = Rs. 1,440,000 - 120,000*m.
  Total investment = Rs. 480,000 + Rs. 600,000 + Rs. 1,440,000 - 120,000*m
  Total Profit was Rs. 375,000 and C's share was Rs. 150,000, so the remaining profit (after giving Rs. 150,000 to C) would be 375,000-150,000 = Rs. 225,000
  We know each person's share is proportional to their investment and the time period they worked. 
  Let's call the time for which C worked as 't' months.
  So, A's share would be (480,000/12)*12=Rs. 480,000
  B's share would be (600,000/12)*10=Rs. 500,000
  C's share would be (120,000/12)*t=Rs. 10,000*t

  10,000t = 150,000+225,000 = 375,000
  Solving the above equation, we get t = 37.5

  Let's start by finding the last integer:
  (first integer + last integer) / 2 * k = sum
  (-50 + last integer) / 2 * k = 51
  (-50 + last integer) * k = 102
  -50k + last integer * k = 102
  last integer * k = 102 + 50k
  last integer = (-50k + 102) / k
  
  Because the last integer is an integer, it means that the numerator (-50k + 102) must be divisible by k.
  102 is divisible by k, so 50k must also be divisible by k.
  This can only happen if k = 50 or k = 1.
  If k = 1, then the sum of one integer is itself, so it can't be 51.
  Therefore, k = 50.
  
  Now that we know k, we can find the last integer:
  last integer = (-50k + 102) / k = (-50*50 + 102) / 50 = (-2500 + 102) / 50 = -2398/50
  
  The last integer is not an integer, so we made a mistake in our calculations.
  The answer is none of the above.

 We know one side is 9 feet long.
 Let's call the width of the rectangle ""w"".
 The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so we can set up the equation:

  Let's use the quadratic formula to find the value of m.
  The quadratic formula is given by: x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a

Action: 
  Let's substitute the values and simplify:
  x = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4(1)(22))) / 2(1)

  Let's use this information to find the value of 'm'.
  
  We know that the sum of roots of a quadratic equation is equal to -b/a, where a and b are the coefficients of the quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0.
  In other words, x1 + x2 = -b/a, where x1 and x2 are the roots of the quadratic equation.
  
  Since one of the roots is given to us as 1.5, let's use this information to find the other root.
  
  We know that the product of roots of a quadratic equation is equal to c/a.
  In other words, x1 * x2 = c/a, where x1 and x2 are the roots of the quadratic equation.
  
  Therefore, x1 * x2 = 22/a
  
  Also, we know that x1 + x2 = -m/a
  
  We can use the given root x = 1.5 to find the other root. 
  Since the sum of roots is -m/a, we get 1.5 + x2 = -m/a, or x2 = (-m/a) - 1.5.
  
  Substituting x2 in terms of 'm' and 'a' in the above equation, we get:
  1.5 * [(-m/a) - 1.5] = 22/a
  
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:

  Substituting the given values into the quadratic formula and solving for the other root:
  Let a = 1, b = m, and c = 22.

  - 504/M = x/800, where x is the equivalent marks for 504 over M when the maximum mark is converted to 800.
  - 420/800 = 504/M, where 420 over 800 is the equivalent marks for the candidate when the maximum mark is 800.
  We can solve this system of equations and find the value of M.
  First, isolate x from the first ratio: x = (504 x 800) / M.
  Substitute x in the second ratio: 420/800 = 504 x 800 / M.
  Cross multiply: 420M = 504 x 800 x 800.
  Solve for M: M = (504 x 800 x 800) / 420.
  M = 76800.
  The value of M is 76800, which is not one of the choices. However, we can simplify this value by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor (GCF), which is 1600. Hence, M = 76800/1600 = 48.

  If two numbers have the same remainder upon division by a third number, then the difference between these two numbers is divisible by that third number.

  When dividing 2272 by ""abc"", we can write: 2272 = x*(abc)+r
  When dividing 875 by ""abc"", we can write: 875 = y*(abc)+r
  Since both remainders are equal, we can equate the right-hand side of both equations to get:
  2272-875 = (x-y)*abc
  1397 = (x-y)*abc
  abc = 1397/(x-y)
  Since ""abc"" has three digits, 100 <= abc <= 999.

      - Jill's rate of cleaning = 0.05*1/12 = 1/240
      - Two-thirds of the work = Jack's rate x Time = (1/12)x(2/3) = 1/18
      - One-third of the work = Jill's rate x Time = (1/240)x(x)
      - By adding the work done by Jack and Jill, we should get the total work, which is 1. Therefore:

  If Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in 1 hour.
  Jack finished two-thirds of the work. So, the remaining work is 1/3 of the yacht.
  Jack finishes 1/3 of the work in (1/3) / (1/12) = 4 hours.
  Jill can clean 5% of the yacht in 1 hour. So, she can clean 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht in an hour.
  Jill needs to clean 1/3 of the yacht, which is 80 times more than what she can clean in 1 hour.
  Therefore, Jill needs 80 times more time to finish the remaining work compared to Jack.

  Let us assume Jill takes ""x"" number of hours to complete the remaining work (1/3)*W.
  Jack can complete the entire work in 12 hours, so his work rate is (1/12)*W per hour.
  Jill's work rate is only 5% of Jack's work rate. Therefore, her work rate is (5/100)*(1/12)*W = (1/240)*W per hour.
  From our assumptions, we know that Jack completed (2/3)*W work and Jill completed the remaining (1/3)*W work.
  Jack's work rate + Jill's work rate = Combined Rate
  (1/12)*W + (1/240)*W =  (1/(x))*((1/3)*W)

Let's assume that cleaning the yacht is 3 units (LCM of 3 and 4).

The remaining portion of the work is 1 unit (3-2=1). Thus, Jill has to do 1 unit of work.
Jill's rate is just 5% of what Jack can do. Therefore, Jill can clean 1/20 of the yacht in 1 hour. 
We can calculate Jill's time using the formula: Time = Work ÷ Rate.

We need to start by calculating the amount of work done by Jack on that day. 
Since Jack can clean the yacht in 12 hours, he can clean 1/12 of the yacht in an hour. 
Jack finished two-thirds of the work, which is 2/3 of the yacht. 
So, the portion of work completed by Jack is: (2/3) * 1 = 2/3. 
That means the remaining portion is 1/3.

Now, we can find how long it will take Jill to finish 1/3 of the yacht. 
Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, which is (5/100) * (1/12) = 1/240 of the yacht in an hour. 
Let's say it takes Jill x hours to finish the remaining 1/3 of the yacht. 
We can set up the equation: 

(1/240) * x = (1/3)

  Let the amount of work Jack can do in one hour be ""J"".
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do. So Jill can clean 5/100 * J = J/20 in one hour.
  Jack completes one-third of the work. Therefore, the time Jill requires to complete the remaining two-thirds of the work can be calculated using the formula T = D/R, where T is the time, D is the distance (work) remaining to be done, and R is the rate at which Jill can clean.
  The distance remaining to be done is two-thirds of the yacht, which is (2/3).
  The rate at which Jill can clean is J/20.

  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  Therefore, the total number of coins she brought is x+y.
  The total amount of money she made from copper coins is 20x cents.
  The total amount of money she made from brass coins is 25y cents.

  Hence, the equation is 20x + 25y = 340.
  Let's find the possible values for x.
  If x = 0 (no copper coins), then 25y = 340, which is not possible since y has to be a positive integer.
  If x = 1, then 25y = 320, which gives y = 12.8, but y has to be a positive integer.
  If x = 2, then 25y = 300, which gives y = 12, which is a positive integer.

  Let c be the number of copper coins and b be the number of brass coins that the coin-diver brought
  The coin-diver gets 20c cents for bringing up c copper coins, and 25b cents for bringing up b brass coins.
  The sum that the coin-diver gets is 20c + 25b cents
  Given that the coin-diver got $3.40, this can be written as:
    20c + 25b = 340
  Since we want to minimize the number of copper coins, we can assume that all coins are copper.
  If the coin-diver brought only one copper coin, she would get 20 cents, which is not enough to reach $3.40.
  If the coin-diver brought two copper coins, she would get 40 cents, which is still not enough.
  If the coin-diver brought three copper coins, she would get 60 cents, which is still not enough.

  Let's assume that the three digits are a, b, and c. 
  According to the problem, a + b + c = 17 ----- (Equation 1)
  Also, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 ----- (Equation 2)
  If we subtract 495 from the original number, we get a 3-digit number in which the digits are the same as those of the original number written in a reverse order. 
  Therefore, the difference between the original number and the number obtained by reversing the digits should be a multiple of 9. 
  Let's write the original number as 100a + 10b + c. 
  The number obtained by reversing the digits is 100c + 10b + a. 
  Therefore, 
  (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) = (99a - 99c) = 99(a-c)
  Since 99 is a multiple of 9, we can conclude that (a-c) is also a multiple of 9. 
  Let's assume that a > c. Then, the possible values for (a-c) are 9 and 18.
  If a-c = 9, then {(a,c) = (9,0), (8,1), (7,2), (6,3)}.
  If a-c = 18, then {(a,c) = (9,9)}.
  Let's use these possible pairs of (a,c) to find the value of b that satisfies both Equation 1 and Equation 2.

Calculation:
  If (a,c) = (9,0), then a + b + c = 17 => b = 8 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 is not satisfied.
  If (a,c) = (8,1), then a + b + c = 17 => b = 8 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 is satisfied.
  If (a,c) = (7,2), then a + b + c = 17 => b = 8 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 is not satisfied.
  If (a,c) = (6,3), then a + b + c = 17 => b = 8 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 is not satisfied.
  If (a,c) = (9,9), then a + b + c = 27 => b = 1 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 243 + 1 + 81 = 325 is not satisfied.

  We are given that:
  A + B + C = 17 ---(1)
  A^2 + B^2 + C^2 = 109 ---(2)
  When we subtract 495 from the number we get CBA, which means the new number has the same digits as ABC but written backwards.
  This gives us:
  100A + 10B + C - 495 = 100C + 10B + A
   => 99A - 99C = 495
   => A - C = 5  ---(3)
  From equation (1), we know that A + B = 17 - C. Substituting (3) into this equation, we get:
  B = C + 12  ---(4)
  We also know that A, B, and C are digits between 0 and 9, inclusive.
  From equations (1) and (4), we know that A = 5 or 6 and C = 0 or 1.
  Substituting these values of A and C into (2) yields B^2 = 7 or 8. This implies that B = 2 or 3 (since B is a digit).
  If B = 2, then C = -10, which is not possible.

  Let the hundreds digit, tens digit, and ones digit of the number be a, b, and c respectively.

  We are also told that when we subtract 495 from the number, we get the reverse of the original number.
  Let's use algebra to solve for a, b, and c.
  From the first equation, we know that a=17-b-c.
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get (17-b-c)^2+b^2+c^2=109.
  Expanding and simplifying, we get 2b^2+2c^2-34b-34c+90=0.
  Dividing by 2, we get b^2+c^2-17b-17c+45=0.
  We can rewrite this as (b-17/2)^2-289/4+(c-17/2)^2-289/4+45=0.
  Simplifying, we get (b-17/2)^2+(c-17/2)^2=17.
  From this, we can see that b and c must be either 1 or 4 (since they must be positive integers and the only pairs of integers that add up to 17 are 1 and 16 or 4 and 13).
  
  Let's try out the possible values for b and c.
  If b=1 and c=16, then a=0. However, 495 cannot be subtracted from this number to get the reverse of the original number.
  If b=4 and c=13, then a=0. Plugging these values into the equation for the original number, we get 407. When we subtract 495 from this, we get 704, which is the reverse of the original number.

  We need to find a three-digit number that satisfies the given conditions.
  We can use algebra to solve for the number.
      Let the three digit number be represented by abc.
      The sum of its digits is a + b + c = 17.
      The sum of the squares of its digits is a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
      The number with digits in reverse order is cba.
      When we subtract 495 from abc, we get cba. Therefore, abc - 495 = cba.
      Substituting cba for abc and reversing the order of the equation, we have cba + 495 = abc.
      Substituting the value of abc in terms of a, b, and c into this equation, we get:
      cba + 495 = 100a + 10b + c
      Reversing the order of cba + 495 gives 594 + abc = 100a + 10b + c.
      By adding the two equations above, we get 1095 = 101a + 11b
      From the equation  a + b + c = 17, we know that a + b = 17 - c.
      Substituting a + b = 17 - c into the equation 1095 = 101a + 11b, we get 1095 = 101a + 11(17-c)
      Simplifying the equation above, we get 94a - 11c = 926
      Since c is a digit, it can only have a value between 0 and 9.
      We can test each possible value of c to see if there are integers a and b that satisfy the equation above.
      If we assume c = 1, then the equation above becomes 94a = 937.
      Since 937 is not divisible by 94, there is no integer value of a that satisfies the equation.
      If we assume c = 2, then the equation above becomes 94a - 22 = 926.
      Solving for a, we get a = 10.
      Since a is a digit, this is not a valid solution.
      If we assume c = 3, then the equation above becomes 94a - 33 = 926.
      Solving for a, we get a = 10.
      Since a is a digit, this is not a valid solution.
      If we assume c = 4, then the equation above becomes 94a - 44 = 926.
      Solving for a, we get a = 10.
      Since a is a digit, this is not a valid solution.
      If we assume c = 5, then the equation above becomes 94a - 55 = 926.
      Solving for a, we get a = 11.
      Substituting a = 11 into the equation a + b + c = 17, we get b + c = 6.
      Since a + b + c = 17, b + c = 6 implies that a = 6.
      Now we know that a = 6, b + c = 6, and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
      Since b + c = 6, the possible pairs for (b, c) are (0, 6), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), (4, 2), (5, 1), and (6, 0).
      Since a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109, we can rule out the pairs (0, 6), (5, 1), and (6, 0), since in these cases, a^2 + b^2 + c^2 is greater than 109.
      If we test the remaining pairs, we find that (3, 3) is the only pair that works.

Let:

  c = number of infected by both viruses and worms
  
We know from the problem that:
  a + b + c = 250              ---(1)
  b = 2.5c                     ---(2)
  a = 0.5(250) - (b + c)       ---(3)
  
We need to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm.

Let X = number of files that are not infected by a virus.

Then X + a = 0.5(250)
Therefore, X = 125 - a

We can solve the system of equations using substitution.
Substituting (2) and (3) into (1), we have:

  (0.5)250 = 125 = (0.5c + a + 2.5c + c)
  
Simplifying,

  3.5c + a = 125                ---(4)
  
Substituting (2) and (4), we get:
  
  3.5(2.5c) + a = 125
  
  8.75c = 125 - a
  
  Multiplying by 4 on both sides:
  
  35c = 500 - 4a
  
  Therefore, 4a + 35c = 500              ---(5)
  
We can now solve for a and b.
Substituting (2) into (3), we get:

  a = 250/2 - 3.5c
  
  a = 125 - 3.5c                      ---(6)

Substituting (6) into (5), we get:

  4(125 - 3.5c) + 35c = 500
  
  500 - 14c + 35c = 500
  
  21c = 0
  
  c = 0
  
So, b = 2.5c = 0
  
Also, a + b + c = 250
  
  a + 0 + 0 = 250
  
  a = 250
  
Therefore, we have a = 250, b = 0, and c = 0.
  
X = 125 - a = 125 - 250 = -125

We cannot have a negative result for the number of files not infected by a worm, so we know something is wrong.

Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

  Let V represent the number of files infected by a virus only.
  Let W represent the number of files infected by a worm only.
  Let X represent the number of files infected by both virus and worm.
  Since all 250 files are either infected by virus, worm, or both, then we can say that:
  V + W + X = 250 ----- equation 1
  We are told that ""The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm""
  Therefore, we can say that W = 2.5X  ----- equation 2
  We also know that  ""50% of the files were not infected by a virus""
  Therefore, the number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of 250 which is equal to 125. 
  So, V = 125. 
  We want to find the number of files not infected by a worm, which is equivalent to finding the number of files that are ONLY infected by a virus (V only).
  To find V only, we need to subtract X from V. Since X is equivalent to 0.4V (from equation 2), then we can say that X = 0.4V. 
  Therefore, we can rewrite equation 1 as:
  V + W + 0.4V = 250
  1.4V + 2.5X = 250  ---- substituting W with 2.5X (from equation 2)
  1.4V + 2.5(0.4V) = 250  ---- substituting X with 0.4V
  1.4V + 1V = 250
  2.4V = 250
  V = 104.1666667  --- approximately 104.
  The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5X = 2.5(0.4V) = 1V = approximately 104. 
  Therefore, the number of files infected by both virus and worm is X = 0.4V = 0.4(104) = approximately 42.

- Let's start with the following variables:
  - x: the number of files infected only by a virus.
  - y: the number of files infected only by a worm.
  - z: the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
- We know that the total number of files is 250, so we have:
  
  x + y + z = 250
  
- We also know that ""The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm,"" so we have:

  y = 2.5z

- We're told that ""50% of the files were not infected by a virus,"" so we have:

  x + z = 0.5(250) = 125
  
- Finally, we want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, which is:

  w = 125 - y

- Substituting y = 2.5z from the second equation into w, we get:

  w = 125 - 2.5z
  
- Substituting x + z = 125 from the third equation into the first equation, we get:

  (125 - z) + y + z = 250
  
- Substituting y = 2.5z from the second equation into the previous equation, we get:

  x + 3.5z = 125
  
- We can solve these two equations for x and z:

  x = 125 - 3.5z
  z = (125 - x) / 3.5
  
- Now, we can substitute these equations for x and z in the equation for w:

  w = 125 - 2.5((125 - x) / 3.5)
  
- Simplifying this expression, we get:

  w = 25 + (2/7)x
  
- Since x is the number of files infected only by a virus, and we know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus (i.e., x + z = 125), we can conclude that:

  x = 125 - z = 125 - ((125 - x) / 3.5)

- Solving this equation for x, we get:

  x = 87.5
  
- Therefore, the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm is:

  w = 25 + (2/7)x = 25 + (2/7)(87.5) ≈ 50.89 ≈ 51

  We know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, which also means that 50% of the files were infected by a virus.
  Let V be the number of files infected by a virus only, W be the number of files infected by a worm only, and X be the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  We know that V + X + W = 250 (since all files are either infected by a virus or a worm or both).
  We also know that W = 2.5 X (since the number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm).
  We can create an equation using the information that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus.
  We know that V + X = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were infected by a virus).
  Solving for V, we get V = 125 - X.
  We can substitute W = 2.5 X and V = 125 - X into the equation V + X + W = 250 and solve for X.
  
Calculation:
  V + X + W = 250
  (125 - X) + X + 2.5X = 250
  3.5X = 125
  X = 35.71 ~ 36
  Therefore, there are 36 files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  W = 2.5 X = 2.5*36 = 90
  V = 125 - X = 125 - 36 = 89
  
  The number of files that were not infected by a worm is equal to the number of files infected by a virus only, which is V = 89.

  Let ""V"" be the set of files infected by a virus only.
  Let ""W"" be the set of files infected by a worm only.
  Let ""VW"" be the set of files infected by both a virus and a worm.
  We know that: 
      V + W + VW = 250  ---(1)           (total number of files)
      W = 2.5 * VW     ---(2)           (number of files that are only infected by a worm)
      V = 0.5 * (250 - V)  ---(3)      (50% files are not infected by a virus) 

  From (1), we can express VW in terms of V and W as: 
      VW = 250 - (V + W)                 (by rearranging the equation) 
  Substituting (2) and (3) into (1), we get:
      2.5VW + VW + 0.5(250 - V) = 250 
      Simplifying the above equation, we get: 
      3.5VW - 0.5V = 125

  Solving the above equation, we get:
      VW = 35
      V = 15
      W = 70
  We want to find the number of files that were NOT infected by a worm, i.e., 
       (number of files that were not infected by virus) + (number of files infected by both virus and worm)
       = 0.5 * (250 - V) + VW

  Let T2 be the time taken by Bob to reach X from Y.
  Then, the total time taken by Allen to cover two-way distance between X and Y will be 2*T1.
  Also, the total time taken by Bob to cover two-way distance between X and Y will be 2*T2.
  Distance = Speed * Time. Therefore, Allen's distance will be 54*T1 km and Bob's distance will be 78*T2 km.
  The distance covered by Allen before they meet for the second time will be 54 * T1/2 km, and the distance covered by Bob in the same time will be 78 * T2/2 km.
  We know the distance covered by Bob will be 48 km more than Allen. Therefore we can write the following equation:
    78 * T2/2 - 54 * T1/2 = 48
  We also know that the total distance covered by Allen and Bob before they meet for the second time is z. Therefore we can write the following equation:
    54 * T1/2 + 78 * T2/2 = z
  By solving these two equations, we can find the value of z.

Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is d km.
Let's also assume that they meet after t hours and that they meet for the second time in t1 hours.
Let's find an expression for t:
  Allen's distance + Bob's distance = d
  (54 kmph)*t + (78 kmph)*t = d
  t = d/132
Let's find an expression for t1:
  The relative speed of Allen and Bob is (54 kmph + 78 kmph) = 132 kmph
  So, the time taken for them to meet for the second time can be expressed as:
  t1 = (48 km)/(132 kmph)
We need to find the distance between X and Y i.e. d, using the above two equations:
  Allen's distance in t1 hours = (54 kmph) * (t1) = (54/132) * (48/132) * d
  Bob's distance in t1 hours = (78 kmph) * (t1) = (78/132) * (48/132) * d
  Bob has traveled 48 km more than Allen.
  So, (78/132) * (48/132) * d - (54/132) * (48/132) * d = 48

Let's assume the distance between X and Y is ""d"".
Let's assume they both meet after ""t"" time.
Their combined speed will be 54 + 78 = 132kmph.
Allen travels half the distance from X to Y and halts at the midpoint. So, the midpoint is d/2.
At this point, Bob covers d/2 + 48 km.
Distance covered by Allen: (d/2)
Distance covered by Bob: d/2 + 48
We can use the formula Distance = Speed × Time for both to get the time it takes to meet.
Time taken by Allen to cover d/2 distance (t1) = (d/2) / 54 = d/108
Time taken by Bob to cover d/2 + 48 distance (t2) = (d/2 + 48) / 78 = (d+96)/156
Total time when they meet again = t1 + t2 = d/108 + (d+96)/156
We know that they meet at the midpoint, so the distance Allen covers = d/2
We know that they travel at opposite directions, so the distance Bob covers = d/2 + 48
Using the formula ""distance = speed × time"", we can equate both distances.
(d/2) = 54 x (d/108)
(d/2 + 48) = 78 x [(d+96)/156]

    Time for Bob to reach X from Y is t2 hours.
  
  Traveling from X to Y, Allen covers d km, same as Bob.
  We know that time = distance/speed, therefore:
    t1 = d/54  (time taken by Allen to reach Y)
    t2 = d/78  (time taken by Bob to reach X)

  Once they meet for the first time, say at point M, the distance travelled by Allen = distance travelled by Bob
  Let's assume, distance between X and M (or Y and M) = x km
  Therefore:
    Allen covers x km in (t1/2) hours, as he changes the direction and returns to X.
    Bob covers (d-x) km in (t2/2) hours, as he changes the direction and returns to Y.

  In this scenario, we can equate the distance covered by Allen and Bob and solve for x as:

  Simplifying this, we get:

Let d be the distance from X to Y. 
When they meet for the first time, the total distance they travel is d.
Let t1 be the time it takes for them to meet for the first time.
Let t2 be the time it takes for them to meet for the second time.
Since Allen travels at 54kmph and Bob at 78kmph, we can set up the equations:
d = 54t1 + 78t1 (the total distance they cover when they first meet)
d = 54t1 + 78t2 - 48 (the distance covered by Bob more than Allen)
When they meet for the second time, their total distance traveled is 2d, since they both covered d in the first part of the journey.
Let t be the total time for the entire journey (from X to Y and back).
Then, we have:
2d = 54t + 78t
t = d/66
Substituting t into the equation for the distance covered by Bob more than Allen, we get:
d = 54t1 + 78t2 - 48
d = 54t1 + 78(2t1 - d/66) - 48
d = 186t1 - d - 48
2d = 186t1 - 48
2d + 48 = 186t1
t1 = (2d + 48)/186
Substituting t1 into the equation for d, we get:
d = 54t1 + 78t2 - 48
d = 54(2d + 48)/186 + 78t2 - 48
186d = 54(2d + 48) + 78t2(186)
186d = 108d + 5616 + 14508t2
78d = 14508t2 - 5616
d = (14508t2 - 5616)/78
Since t = d/66, we can write:
t2 = d/66 - t1
Substituting t1 and t2 into the equation for d, we get:
d = 54t1 + 78t2 - 48
d = 54(2d + 48)/186 + 78(d/66 - (2d + 48)/186) - 48

Let's assume that the distance between X and Y is 'd' km.
When Allen and Bob meet for the first time, let's say they have traveled 'x' km and 'y' km respectively.
At their first meeting, since they both have to travel the same distance, we know that: x + y = d
We are also given that Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob at 78 kmph. Let's use 't' to represent the time it takes for them to meet for the first time.
Therefore, using the formula that distance = speed × time, we can write:
  x = 54t  for Allen, and 
  y = 78t  for Bob.
At their second meeting, Allen would have traveled the distance from Y to X and back to Y, or 2d, while Bob would have traveled from X to Y and back to X, or 2d.

  They meet for the first time when they are  (d/2) km apart.
  Let's represent the distance between the meeting point and the destination X by ""x"".
  From the given information, we can form the following equations:

  Allen's distance:
    - distance = speed * time 
    - A1 = 54t
    - A2 = 54(t+(d/54))
  Bob's distance:
    - B1 = 78t
    - B2 = 78(t+(d/78))
  Since they meet for the second time, Bob has to cover 48 km more than Allen by that time.
  Therefore, the sum of the distances traveled by Allen plus 48km, should be equal to the distance traveled by Bob. 

  A2 + 48 = B2
  54(t+(d/54)) + 48 = 78(t+(d/78))

  Simplifying the above equation, we get
  24t = d

  Now substituting ""24t"" in any of the equations, we can get the value of ""d""

  A1 = 54t
  A1 = 54(24t)
  A1 = 1296t

  Since A1 represents the distance between X and Y,
  d = 1296t

  Therefore, the distance between X and Y is 1296t km.

  Let's now calculate the value of ""t"" by using the fact that they meet for the first time when they are (d/2) km apart.

  Total distance covered by both of them is ""d""
  Allen covers ""d/2"" km in ""t"" hours
  Bob covers ""(d/2)+48"" km in ""t"" hours

  (d/2) + (d/2)+48 = (54+78)t
  d+96 = 132t
  24t = d

  Substituting the value of ""24t"" in the above equation, we get

  Therefore, if there were 64 water lilies initially, after t days we have 64 * 2^(t/2) lilies.
  We want to find how many days it takes for the number of lilies to reach 1,152,921,504.
  We can set up the following equation and solve for t:
      64 * 2^(t/2) = 1,152,921,504
      2^(t/2) = 18,015,640
      t/2 = log2(18,015,640)

  Let X be the number of days it takes to fully cover the lake when there are 64 water lilies.
  Since the number of water lilies doubles every two days, we know that the number of water lilies on day X-2 must be half the number of water lilies on day X.
  So there are 32 water lilies on day (X-2).
  Similarly, the number of water lilies on day (X-4) must be half the number of water lilies on day (X-2), which is 16.
  Continuing this pattern, we can see that there must have been only one water lily on day (X-56).
  So, it took (X-56) days for the number of water lilies to grow from 1 to 64.
  Therefore, X-56=60 and X=116.
  So it would take 116 days in total to fully cover the lake when initially there were 64 water lilies.

  Let's work backwards from the point where the lake is fully covered with lilies. 
  If the lake is fully covered with lilies after 60 days, and the number of lilies doubles every two days, then the initial number of water lilies must have been 1 (i.e., 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 > the number of square meters on the Earth). 
  If there are 64 water lilies initially, then we can write the equation 64 * (2^k) = 1073741824, where k represents the number of two-day periods it takes for the lake to be fully covered. 
  Solving for k, we get k = 25 (rounding up from 24.6865)

  If the number of lilies is doubling every two days, then we can use the formula N = N0 * 2^(t/2), where N is the final number of lilies, N0 is the initial number of lilies, and t is the time it takes for the number of lilies to double.
  In the first scenario, the final number of lilies is unknown, N0 is 1, and t is 60 days. We can solve for N by plugging in the values: N = 1 * 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = 1,073,741,824 lilies.

  When the two trains meet, they will have traveled a total distance equal to the distance between A and B.
  Let's assume that the speed of train M is x km/h and the speed of train N is y km/h.
  The distance between A and B is the same as the distance between B and A.
  Therefore, x(4) = y(3.5)
  We need to solve for the speed at which the two trains meet by adding their speeds together. 
  So, let's add the speeds of the two trains to get the relative speed of the trains.
  The relative speed of the trains is x + y km/h.
  Finally, we can calculate the time it takes for the two trains to meet by dividing the distance by the relative speed of the trains.
  
  Distance between A and B = Distance between B and A
  Relative speed of the trains = x + y
  Time taken to meet = Distance/Relative speed
  Time taken to meet = Distance between A and B/(x + y)
  Time taken to meet = 280/(x + y)
  
  Therefore, we need to find x and y to get the time taken to meet. 
  Let's rearrange the first equation to solve for y: y = (4x)/3.5
  Substituting y in the second equation, we get: Time taken to meet = 280/(x + (4x)/3.5)
  Simplifying, we get: Time taken to meet = 56/9x
  
  Therefore, we need to find the speed of train M to calculate the time taken to meet.
  We can find x by using the fact that train M travels for 4 hours to reach City B. 
  Let's assume the distance between City A and City B is d km.
  Then, the speed of train M is d/4 km/h.
  Substituting this in the equation above, we get: Time taken to meet = 56/9(d/4)
  Simplifying, we get: Time taken to meet = 14d/9
  To get the time of meeting, we add this time to the time when train N left City B.
  Therefore, the time of meeting is 10:30am + 14d/9 hours.
  
  We don't have the actual value of d km, but we can choose a value and work with it.
  Let's assume that the distance between City A and City B is 560 km.
  Then, the speed of train M is 560/4 = 140 km/h.
  Therefore, the relative speed of the trains is 140 + y km/h.
  Substituting y = (4x)/3.5 = (4*140)/3.5 = 160 km/h, we get: 
  Time taken to meet = 56/9(140 + 160) = 56/9(300) = 224/3 = 1 hour 14 minutes and 40 seconds.
  Adding this time to 10:30am, we get 11:44am (rounded to the nearest minute).

To solve the problem, we can use the formula for the arithmetic mean which is:

Let's use W to denote the weight of the new heavy-duty truck.

- After the new heavy-duty truck was added, the average weight of the group increased by 2.6 tons. So the new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons. This means that the total weight of all 11 vehicles combined is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.

  Let the length of the rectangular plot be 'l' and the breadth be 'b'.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is given by 2(l + b).

  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary. 
  The area of the rectangular plot would be lb.
  The area of the plot with a 1-meter broad boundary will be (l+2) x (b+2).
  The area of the boundary is (l+2)(b+2)-lb.

  We have two equations, l + b = 170 and the cost of the boundary is (l+2)(b+2-lb)*10.

  Let's assume that the length of the rectangular plot is 'l' and the breadth is 'b'.
  The perimeter of the plot is the sum of the lengths of all four sides, which is 2(l+b) = 340.
  Therefore, l+b = 170.
  We need to calculate the cost of gardening around the rectangular plot, which is the area of the garden boundary multiplied by the rate per square metre.
  The area of the garden boundary = area of the rectangle with length (l+2) and breadth (b+2) - area of the rectangle with length (l) and breadth (b).
  Area of the rectangle with length (l+2) and breadth (b+2) = (l+2)(b+2).
  Area of the rectangle with length (l) and breadth (b) = lb.
  Therefore, the area of the garden boundary = (l+2)(b+2) - lb = lb + 2l + 2b + 4 - lb = 2l + 2b + 4.
  The cost of gardening 1 square metre boundary is 10 per square metre.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the entire boundary around the rectangular plot = 10 * (2l + 2b + 4).
  We know, l+b = 170.
  Substituting this value in 10 * (2l + 2b + 4) gives us, cost of gardening the entire boundary around the rectangular plot = 10 * (2*170 + 4).

  We are given:
    The perimeter of a rectangular plot is 340 metres.
    We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula P = 2(L + W), where P is the perimeter, L is the length and W is the width of the rectangle.
    Thus, we can write the equation as 340 = 2(L+W)
    We can use the formula for perimeter to find the length and width of the rectangle, and then use the formula for area of a rectangle to find the area of the rectangular plot.
    Once we have the area of the rectangular plot, we can easily calculate the cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot at the rate of 10 per square metre.
  Calculation:
    340 = 2(L+W)
    L+W = 170
    W = 170 - L
    P = 2(L+W) = 2L + 2(170-L) = 340 - 2L
    L = (340 - P)/2
    W = 170 - L
    Area of rectangle = L*W = L(170-L) = -L^2 + 170L
    Area of rectangular plot with 1-meter broad boundary = (L+2)(W+2) = (L+2)(172-L) = -L^2 + 168L + 344
    Cost of gardening = Area x rate = (-L^2 + 168L + 344) x 10
    Cost of gardening = -10L^2 + 1680L + 3440
    Putting L = (340 - P)/2, we have:
    Cost of gardening = -10[(340 - P)/2]^2 + 1680[(340 - P)/2] + 3440
    Cost of gardening = -10[(340 - P)^2/4] + 1680[(340 - P)/2] + 3440
    Cost of gardening = -5[(340 - P)^2/2] + 840(340 - P)/2 + 3440
    Cost of gardening = -5[(340 - P)^2/2] + 420(340 - P) + 3440
    Cost of gardening = -5[(340 - P)^2/2] + 142400
    Putting P = 340, we get:
    Cost of gardening = -5[(340 - 340)^2/2] + 142400
    Cost of gardening = 142400

  Perimeter is the sum of all sides of a rectangle.
  If the perimeter is given then we can find the length of one side. 
  We can then find the other side by using the area of the rectangle.
  To find the cost of gardening, we need to find the area of the rectangular plot and subtract the area of the inner rectangle (which is formed by leaving a 1-metre broad boundary).
  Then we can multiply this with the given rate to find the cost.
  Let's solve it step by step.
  
  Perimeter of a Rectangle = 2(Length + Width)
  
  Given, Perimeter = 340 metres
  340 = 2(Length + Width)
  Length + Width = 170
  
  Now, we need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
  Let's assume that Length > Width.
  We can write this as:
  Length = Width + x, where x is the extra length
  We know that Length + Width = 170
  Substituting Length = Width + x, we get
  Width + x + Width = 170
  2 Width + x = 170
  Width = (170 - x)/2
  
  Let's find the value of x.
  Perimeter = 2(Length + Width)
  340 = 2(Width + x + Width)
  340 = 4 Width + 2 x
  170 = 2 Width + x
  170 = 2 [(170 - x)/2] + x
  170 = 85 + x/2 + x
  85 = 1.5 x
  x = 56.6667
  
  Width = (170 - x)/2 = (170 - 56.6667)/2 = 56.6666
  
  Area of the rectangular plot = Length * Width
  Area = (Width + x) * Width
  Area = (56.6666 + 56.6667) * 56.6666
  Area = 6434.028
  
  Area of the inner rectangle = (Length-2) * (Width-2)
  Area = (54.6666) * (54.6666)
  Area = 2992.028
  
  Area of the garden = Area of the rectangular plot - Area of the inner rectangle
  Area = 6434.028 - 2992.028
  Area = 3442
  
  Cost of gardening = Area * Cost per square metre
  Cost = 3442 * 10
  Cost = 34420
  
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-metre broad boundary around the rectangular plot will be 34420.

 The question is asking us about the cost of gardening a 1-meter boundary around a rectangular plot.
 We are given that the rectangle has a perimeter of 340 meters.
 We know that the perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
 Since the rectangle has 2 pairs of equal sides, we can divide the total perimeter by 2 to get the sum of the lengths of each pair of equal sides.
 We can then subtract the length of the 1-meter boundary on the sides to get the length of the sides of the actual plot.
 We can then use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the area of the plot.

  Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L, and breadth is B.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340m.
  Therefore, L+B = 170.
  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-metre boundary around the rectangular plot.
  The length of the rectangular plot along with the boundary = L + 2(1) = L + 2.
  The breadth of the rectangular plot along with the boundary = B + 2(1) = B + 2.
  Therefore, the length and breadth of the plot including the boundary are L + 2 and B + 2 respectively.
  The area of the plot including the boundary is (L+2)*(B+2).
  The area of the plot is L*B.
  The cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot = Area of the plot including the boundary * Rate per square meter - Area of the plot * Rate per square meter.
  Cost of gardening = [(L+2)*(B+2)*10] - [L*B*10]
  Cost of gardening = [10LB + 20L + 10B + 40] - [10LB]
  Cost of gardening = 20L + 10B + 40
  From L+B = 170, we know B = 170 - L.
  Substituting B = 170 - L in the cost of gardening equation, we get:
  Cost of gardening = 20L + 10(170-L) + 40
  Cost of gardening = 10L + 1710

  We are given that we need to build a 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot, which means that the new length and breadth of the rectangular plot will be (l+2) and (b+2), respectively.
  The cost of gardening 1 meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot is given by the area of the boundary multiplied by the rate per square meter, i.e. 10.
  The area of the boundary is given by the difference between the area of the new rectangular plot and the old rectangular plot.
  The area of the new rectangular plot is (l+2)(b+2) and the area of the old rectangular plot is lb.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-meter broad boundary is 10((l+2)(b+2) - lb))

Calculation:
  Let's find the value of l and b from the given information.
  2(l+b) = 340
  l+b = 170
  b = 170 - l
  
  Substituting the value of b, we get,

  A = 10((l^2 + 172l + 2l - 344 - l^2 + 170l))

  Let's solve this problem by assigning variables to each person's age.
  Let j = Joe's age
  Let s = Joe's sister's age
  Let f = Joe's father's age
  The sum of their ages is given by j + s + f = 100
  When Joe is as old as his father, their ages will be equal, so f = j
  At that time, Joe's sister will be twice her current age, so s + (f - s) = 2s, which simplifies to f = s
  When Joe is as old as his father, his father will be twice as old as Joe's sister was when their age difference was the same as Joe's and his father's current age difference. Let's call that age difference a. Using that information, we have the equation f + a = 2(s - a)
  Substituting f = s and f = j from the earlier equations, we get j + a = 2(s - a) and s + a = 2(j - a)
  Simplifying those equations, we get 3a = j - s and a = (j - s)/3
  Substituting a in the equation f + a = 2(s - a), we get j = f = s = 3a. Substituting j + s + f = 100, we get 9a = 100, which gives us a = 11 1/9.

- From the first statement, we know that j + s + f = 100.

- When Joe is as old as his father, j + t = f.
- Also, when Joe is as old as his father, s + t = 2s => t = s.
- When Joe is as old as his father, f = 2(s - t) = 2s - 2t.

  Let's say Joe's age is j, Joe's sister's age is s, and Joe's father's age is f.
  From the problem statement, we know that j + s + f = 100.
  Also, we know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now, which means (j+f) + (s + years) = 2(s), where years is the number of years from now until Joe is as old as his father.
  Solving this equation for s, we get: s = j + f - years.
  We are also told that When Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father, which means (j+f) - years = 2(f - s).
  Solving this equation for f, we get: f = 2s + years.
  So, we have two equations for s in terms of j, f, and years: s = j + f - years and s = (f - (j+f))/2.
  Substituting the first equation into the second, we get: j + f - years = (f - (j+f))/2.
  Solving this equation for f, we get: f = 2j + 3years.
  Substituting this equation into the equation j + s + f = 100, we get: j + s + (2j + 3years) = 100.
  Simplifying this equation, we get: 3j + s + 3years = 100.
  We don't know the values of j, s, and years, so we can't solve for f directly. However, we do know that j, s, and f are all positive integers, and that f > j and f > s. Therefore, we can try different values of j, s, and years that satisfy the above equation, until we find a solution that gives us a positive integer value for f that is greater than j and s.
  Trying different values, we find that when j = 15, s = 36, and years = 13, we get f = 49, which is a positive integer greater than j and s.

  Let d be the distance between A and B.
  Let t1 be the time it takes to go from A to B.
  Let t2 be the time it takes to go from B to A.
  
  We know that Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph.
  Therefore, d = 70 * t1. 

  After pausing at B and turning around, Kevin drove at a constant speed of 90 mph on his way back to A.
  Therefore, d = 90 * t2.

  We also know that exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that:
  - he was at a distance of d - 70 miles from A when he was 3 hours away from finishing his trip.
  - the time remaining was t2 - 3 hours
  
  we can calculate the time required to reach the destination from the given data.
  Using this, we can calculate the total time taken for the entire trip.
  And then, we can use the formula d = r * t to calculate the distance between A and B.

Calculation:
  We know that:
  d = 70 * t1
  d = 90 * t2
  d - 70 = r * (t2-3)

  Adding the first two equations,
  70 * t1 + 90 * t2 = d + d
  70 * t1 + 90 * t2 = 2d
  7 * t1 + 9 * t2 = 2d/10   ...(1)

  We have d - 70 = r * (t2-3)
  d - 70 = 90 * (t2-3)
  d = 90*t2 - 240   ...(2)

  Using equation (2) in (1), we get
  7 * t1 + 9 * t2 = (2 * (90 * t2 - 240))/10
  Simplifying
  7 * t1 + 9 * t2 = 18t2 - 48
  7 * t1 = 9 * t2 - 48    ...(3)

  We know that d = 70 * t1
  And, we know that d = 90 * t2 - 240
  So, equating the above equations, we get
  70 * t1 = 90 * t2 - 240
  Simplifying
  7 * t1 = 9 * t2 - 24     ...(4)

  Subtracting equation (4) from equation (3), we get
  0 = 2t2 - 24
  t2 = 12

  From equation (4), 
  7 * t1 = 9 * t2 - 24
  7 * t1 = 9 * 12 - 24
  7 * t1 = 84
  t1 = 12

  We know that d = 70 * t1
  d = 70 * 12
  d = 840

  Thus, the time it takes him to go from B to A at 90mph is also ""t"".
  From the problem statement, we can conclude that he has been traveling for t-3 hours from point B to reach the 70 mile distance to point B.
  Using the formula distance = rate * time:
  The distance from A to B is d = 70t
  The distance from B to the near point to B is 70 = 90(t-3)
  Solving this system of equations for ""t"" gives t = 9.

  d1 = 70t1, where t1 is the time Kevin drove from A to B.
  d2 = 90t2, where t2 is the time Kevin drove from B to A.
  The total distance between A and B is 2x, so the total time spent for the round trip is t1 + t2 = (2x/70) + (2x/90) = (9x/630) + (14x/630) = (23x/630) hours
  3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, so he had driven (2x-70) miles.
  Therefore, the remaining distance is 70 miles and the remaining time to destination is 3 hours.
  Using the formula d = rt, we can write 70 = 90t3, where t3 is the time needed for Kevin to travel the remaining 70 miles.
  Solving this equation gives t3 = 7/9 hours.
  Using d = rt again, we can determine the time needed for Kevin to travel the entire distance x.
  (2x-70) = 70(t1+t2)-70 = (23x/630 - 3) × 70 = (23x-1890)/9
  And (2x-70) = 90(t1+t2) - 90 = (23x/630 - 3) × 90 = (23x-1890)/7

- We can set up two equations:
    - Equation 1: D = 70t1
    - Equation 2: D = 90t2
- We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was still approaching B and was 70 miles away from it. This means that he had 70 more miles to go before reaching B.
- Let t be the total time of his trip. We know that he had 3 hours left at the point when he was 70 miles away from B. This means that t2 = t - t1 - 3 (since t1 + t2 = t).
- We can substitute t - t1 - 3 for t2 in Equation 2 to get D = 90(t - t1 - 3).
- We can substitute 70t1 for D in the equation above to get 70t1 = 90(t - t1 - 3).
- Multiplying this out and simplifying, we get t = 9t1 + 27.
- Substituting this for t in Equation 1, we get D = 630t1.
- We still need to find t1 in order to find D.
- We can use the fact that 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin was 70 miles away from B. This means that he had already traveled 70 miles in the second leg of his trip (from A to B).
- We know that he was traveling at a speed of 90 mph on this leg of the trip, so the time it took him to travel the 70 miles was 70/90 = 7/9 hours.
- We also know that he had 3 hours left in his trip at this point, so the total time of his trip was t = 7/9 + 3 + 7/9 = 24/3 = 8 hours.
- We can now use Equation 1 to solve for t1: D = 70t1, so t1 = D/70.
- Substituting this into the equation we found for t above, we get 8 = 9(D/70) + 27.

  Let's assume that the unknown 5 digit number is ""ABCDE"".
  According to the problem statement, if we add a 1 after this number, it becomes ""ABCDE1"" and it is three times as large as if we add a 1 before this number which becomes ""1ABCDE"".
  Mathematically, we can represent the problem as (10^4 x A) + (10^3 x B) + (10^2 x C) + (10 x D) + E + 1 = 3 x ((10^5 x 1) + (10^4 x A) + (10^3 x B) + (10^2 x C) + (10 x D) + E)

  Let's suppose the number is ABCDE.
  According to the problem statement, the number with a 1 after it i.e. ABCDE1 = 3(1ABCDE).
  Performing multiplication, we get, 100000A + 10000B + 1000C + 100D + 10E + 1 = 30000A + 3000B + 300C + 30D + 3E
  Simplifying, we get, 70000A + 7000B + 700C = 29D + 2E + 1
  Since the LHS is divisible by 7, the RHS should also be divisible by 7.
  The smallest possible value of D and E are 1 and 0 respectively.
  Therefore, 29D + 2E + 1 has to be equal to 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42,... respectively.
  Only 28 satisfies the divisibility condition.
  Putting D = 1 and E = 4, we get 7A + 7B + 7C = 4.
  Therefore, A + B + C = 4/7

  Let's suppose the five-digit number be abcde.
  If we add 1 after this number, then the number becomes abcde1.
  If we add 1 before this number, then the number becomes 1abcde.
  Given that the number with 1 after it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it.
  Therefore, abcde1=3(1abcde)
  So, 100000a+10000b+1000c+100d+10e+1=300000+30000a+3000b+300c+30d+3e
  That is, 99999a+2000b+200c-200d-2e=299999
  Now, in order to get a 5 digit number, a must be 2.
  Substituting a=2, we get 1999b+200c-200d-2e=59999
  Since the last digit must be 7, as adding 1 after the number gives three times the original number.
  Therefore, e=7
  Now, applying divisibility test, the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 3.
  1+9+9+9+b+c-d-2+7 = 33 + b + c - d
  Therefore, b+c-d must be a multiple of 3.
  Now we can try to guess the values of b, c, and d such that b+c-d is a multiple of 3 and 1999b+200c-200d = 59992.

- Let's assume the number of employees as x.
- Each of the x employees contributes y amount of money.
- The total amount can be obtained by multiplying the number of employees with the amount contributed by one employee.
- So from the first statement, xy = 600,000 (Rs. 6 lakh).
- With the second statement, the amount contributed is Rs. 60 more for each of the x employees. So the total amount can be represented as (x * (y + 60)).
- This value must be equal to Rs. 6.24 lakh (624,000).
- So, we can write (x * (y + 60)) = 624,000.
- We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get x * (y + 60) = 600,000 + 60x
- Simplifying the equation further, we will get xy + 60x = 600,000 + 60x.
- We can cancel out 60x from both sides of the equation.
- The resulting equation will be xy = 600,000.
- Therefore, x = 600,000 / y.
- Substituting this value in the second equation, we will get (600,000 / y) * (y + 60) = 624,000.
- We can simplify this equation and get y^2 + 60y - 4,000,000 = 0.
- Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, we will get the value of y as 4000 and - 100.
- We can't have a negative contribution, so we will reject - 100 as the possible solution.
- Again substituting this value for y in the equation x = 600,000 / y, we will get x = 150.

  Let's consider x as the number of miles we can travel with the given amount.
  The cost of the first quarter-mile is $3.50, and the cost of each additional quarter-mile is $0.10.
  The total cost of x miles is (x - 0.25) * 0.10 + 3.50 dollars.
  The total cost of x miles should be less than or equal to $8.50.

- The number of quarter miles we can travel is 5 / 0.10 = 50.
- The total distance we can travel is 50 * 0.25 = 12.5 miles.

  For every quarter-mile traveled, we have to pay $0.10.
  $3.50 is the fare for the first quarter-mile.
  The fare for every subsequent quarter-mile is $0.10.
  If we subtract the fare for the first quarter-mile from the total amount we have, we will get the amount we have left to pay for subsequent quarter-miles.
  We can use the remaining amount to calculate the number of quarter-miles we can travel.
  Finally, we can convert the number of quarter-miles we can travel to miles to get the maximum distance we can travel.
  
Calculation:
  Amount left to pay for subsequent quarter-miles = $8.50 - $3.50 = $5.00
  The cost for each subsequent quarter-mile = $0.10
  The total number of quarter-miles we can travel = $5.00 / $0.10 = 50
  The maximum distance we can travel = 0.25 * 50 = 12.5 miles

  You have $8.50 to spend on the cab fare.
  The cab charges $3.50 for the first quarter-mile and 10 cents for each additional quarter mile.
  Let's assume you will travel x quarter miles after the first quarter mile.
  The cost of travelling x quarter miles after the first quarter mile is 0.10x dollars.
  The total cost of the cab fare must be less than or equal to the amount of money you have, $8.50.
  We can set up an inequality to solve for x:
  $3.50 + 0.10x <= $8.50.
  Subtracting $3.50 from both sides, we get:
  0.10x <= $5.00.
  Dividing both sides by 0.10, we get:
  x <= 50.
  So the maximum number of quarter miles you can travel after the first quarter-mile is 50.

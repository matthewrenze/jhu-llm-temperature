  To verify if a pair satisfy the routine, we need to check if the second number (y) is less than or equal to the square root of the first (x).
  For each pair, calculate the square root of the first number and compare it with the second number to check if the routine is satisfied.
  Pair (99,10): the square root of 99 is ≈ 9.949, which is greater than 10. This pair does not satisfy the routine.
  Pair (85,9): the square root of 85 is ≈ 9.220, which is equal or less than 9. This pair satisfies the routine.
  Pair (50,7): the square root of 50 is ≈ 7.071, which is equal or less than 7. This pair satisfies the routine.
  Pair (1,1): the square root of 1 is 1, which is equal to 1. This pair satisfies the routine.
  Pair (1,0): the square root of 1 is 1, which is greater than 0. This pair does not satisfy the routine.

  Let the total number of employees in the company be 100 (for easier calculation of percentages).
  According to the problem, 75% of employees take a winter vacation.
  So, 100% - 75% = 25% employees do not take a winter vacation.
  Also, 20% of employees take neither winter nor summer vacation.
  Therefore, 100% - 20% = 80% of employees take at least one of the vacations.
  Let's divide employees who take a winter vacation into two groups, (1) those who take a summer vacation as well, and (2) those who don't.
  So, those who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation = 40% - x, where x is the percentage of employees who take both vacations.
  Now, we need to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is equal to (3) employees who take a summer vacation, i.e., Q.
  The total percentage of employees who take a summer vacation, (2), is the sum of (1) and (3).
  (2) = x + Q
  
  Now, let's form an equation for (2) using the given information. 
  (2) = 100% - 20% - 25%
  (2) = 55%
  
  Hence, x + Q = 55%
  Also, we know that x = 40% - (percentage of employees who take summer as well as winter vacation)
  x = 40% - 40% of 75%
  x = 40% - 30%
  x = 10%
  
  Substituting this value in the above equation, we get
  10% + Q = 55%
  Q = 45%
  
  Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is Q = 45%.

Let V = the number of employees in this certain company.
According to the problem:
  0.75V employees take a winter vacation.
  0.4V employees take a winter and a summer vacation.
  0.2V employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.
Therefore, the number of employees who take ONLY a winter vacation is:
  (0.75V - 0.4V) = 0.35V
The number of employees who take a summer vacation either with a winter vacation or without a winter vacation is:
 (0.4V + Q)V.
Since 0.2V employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then we use the equation:
  0.35V + (0.4V + Q)V + 0.2V = V

From the information given, we know that: 
- 75% of employees take winter vacation. Therefore, 25% of employees don't take winter vacation(or 25 employees out of 100).
- 40% of employees take both winter and summer vacation. Therefore, it means 40% of 75 employees take summer vacation as well, which is equal to 30 employees.
- 20% of employees take neither winter nor summer vacation, which amounts to 20 employees.

Hence, the total number of employees who take a summer vacation is: 
  30 (those that take both summer and winter vacations) + x (those who take only summer vacation) 

Since 20 employees take neither vacation, we know: 

  20 (neither) + 25 (did not take Winter) + 30 (those that took both) + x (those that took Summer only) = 100

  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then we can calculate the numbers and percentages of employees taking different types of vacation as follows:
  - 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so there are 75 employees taking a winter vacation.
  - 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, so there are 40 employees taking both winter and summer vacations.
  - 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so there are 20 employees who take no vacation at all.
  - The rest of the employees take only a summer vacation or both summer and other vacations.
  - To find out how many employees take only a summer vacation, we can subtract the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations from the number of employees who take a summer vacation.
  - There are 100 - 20 = 80 employees who take at least one vacation.
  - There are 75 - 40 = 35 employees who take a winter vacation only or other vacations in addition to winter vacation.
  - Therefore, there are 80 - 35 = 45 employees who take only a summer vacation or both summer and winter vacations.
  - To find out what Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to divide the number of employees who take only a summer vacation (45) by the number of employees who take at least one vacation (80), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

  The rectangular solid has dimensions 3 x 4 x 15.
  Imagine inscribing a sphere that the rectangular solid fits inside.
  The diameter of the sphere will be equal to the length of the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  Using the formula for the length of the diagonal of a rectangular solid, we get D = sqrt(3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2).
  Calculating this, we have D = sqrt(9 + 16 + 225) = sqrt(250) = 5*sqrt(10).
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2 * (5*sqrt(10)) =  10*sqrt(10).

  A rectangular solid has 8 vertices which will be point on the sphere when it is inscribed in a sphere. 
  In other words, the diameter of the sphere passes through two points or vertices on the rectangular solid. 
  Therefore, we need to find the maximum distance between any two vertices on the rectangular solid to calculate the diameter of the sphere.

Calculation:
  The maximum distance between two vertices is the diagonal of the box. 
  Diagonal can be calculated by Pythagorean theorem.

  Let the diagonal of the rectangular solid be d.
  Then, d^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2
         d^2 = 9 + 16 + 225
         d^2 = 250
         d =  15.8114 (to nearest 0.0001)

  The diameter of the sphere is just the diagonal of the rectangular solid, or 2d.
  Therefore, the diameter of the sphere is 2d = 2 x 15.8114 = 31.6228

  Rounded to four decimal places, the answer is 31.6228 which is same as B: 15.8113.

  A rectangular solid has 8 vertices.
  All 8 vertices are on a sphere, centered at the center of the sphere.
  The diameter of the sphere is the diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The length of diagonal of a 3 x 4 x 15 rectangular solid can be solved using the Pythagorean Theorem.
  The square of the length of the diagonal of this rectangular solid is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of its edges.
  The square of the length of diagonal is: 3^2 + 4^2 + 15^2 = 9 + 16 + 225 = 250.
  The length of diagonal is the square root of 250.
  The diameter of the sphere is equal to the length of diagonal of the rectangular solid.
  The square root of 250 is approximately 15.81.

- Combining these two equations together we will get an estimation for the number of helpers required.

We need to determine the number of helpers required to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes in 3 hours.
One helper can make 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes within an hour.

Let x be the number of helpers required.
The total number of large cakes they can make in 3 hours is 2 * 6x = 12x

To solve the problem, we need to find out how many hours it will take to produce the required number of small cakes and large cakes. We can then determine how many helpers are needed to work for that duration of time, given that each helper can produce a certain number of cakes.

Let X be the number of helpers needed.
One helper's work in 1 hour can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes.
Let's find the total amount of time T taken by X helpers to produce the required number of cakes.
20 large cakes are needed, so the helpers need to produce 20/2 = 10 large cakes.
Similarly, 700/35 = 20 small cakes are required.
Therefore, the total number of cakes required is 10 + 20 = 30.
Let L be the number of hours required to make 10 large cakes.
L = 10/(2*X) = 5/X.
Similarly, let S be the number of hours required to make 20 small cakes.
S = 20/(35*X) = 4/(7*X).
The total time T is given by T = L + S = 5/X + 4/(7*X) = (35 + 20)/7X = 55/7X.
We know that T should be less than or equal to 3 hours, since that's the amount of time available.

20 large cakes are required.

- 120 miles/hr can be divided into 2 to convert it from miles per hour to miles per second -> 120/2 = 60
- The train covers 1 mile of the tunnel in 3 seconds, therefore it can be concluded that it covers 1/3 miles in 1 second, meaning for 1 mile it will take 3*1 = 3*1/3 seconds.
- We also have to consider the length of the train to fully calculate the time required for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
- The answer should be the sum of the time required by the train to cover the length of the tunnel and the time required by the train to pass completely.
- So, the distance that train covers completely = 1 + length of train
- Let's assume that length of train is L miles. Then, the total distance covered by train = 1 + L miles.
- Time = Distance / Speed -> Total time = (1 + L) / (60 miles/second).
- We just need to now calculate the value of L which will help us find out the total time taken by the train.
- So, when the train enters the tunnel, it starts to cover the length of the tunnel, i.e 1 mile. But during this time, part of the train is still outside the tunnel.
- The length covered is the distance covered in 3 seconds at a speed of 120 miles/hr.
- 120 miles/hr -> 2 miles/second (approx). Therefore, in 3 seconds the distance covered = 3 * 2 = 6 miles.
- So, the length of the train L = 1 mile - 6 miles = -5 miles. 
- This is a non-nonsensical result, so we know that the assumption that the length of the train is L is wrong.
- Let's assume that the train's length is L miles and it passes through the tunnel in x seconds.
- In that case, the total distance covered by train = 1 + L miles
- So, time to cover that distance = (1 + L) / (60 miles/second)
- During this period of time, the tail end of the train moves at a speed of (120 miles/hour) / (3600 seconds/hour) = (1/30) miles/second
- This helps us calculate the distance covered by the tail end of the train in x seconds.
- Distance = Speed * Time = (1/30) miles/second * x seconds
- But we know that the whole train has covered a distance of 1 + L miles, so the head of the train must have covered a distance of (1 + L) - L = 1 mile.
- Thus, we can set up the equation (1/30)x + L = 1
- Solving this equation for x, we get x = (30 - 30L) / 29

- We need to find the time for the train to travel 2 lengths with speed of 1/2 miles/second

  First, we calculate the length of the tunnel in feet as it is easier to convert from miles per hour into feet per second.
  1 mile = 5280 feet
  The length of the tunnel = 1 mile = 5280 feet
  To convert 120 miles/hour into feet/second, we multiply 120 by 5280 and divide by 3600 as there are 3600 seconds in an hour.
  This gives us 120 * 5280 / 3600 = 176 feet/second as the speed of the train.
  Now, we can calculate how long it will take for the train to pass completely through the tunnel by dividing the length of the tunnel by the speed of the train.

  There are 5,280 feet/mile.
  Train speed is 120 miles per hour, which is 120 * 5280 = 633,600 feet per hour.
  We need to find how much distance the train covers in 3 seconds.
  Distance = Speed * Time
  Time = 3 seconds = 1/120 hours
  Therefore, Distance = Speed * Time = 633,600 * (1/120) feet
  Tunnel Length = 1 mile = 5,280 feet
  Train has to cover the tunnel length, as well as the distance moved in covering the length of the tunnel.
  Total Distance Covered by the train = Tunnel Length + Distance Moved in Covering the Length
  Total Distance Covered = 5,280 + 633,600 * (1/120) feet
  Total Time taken = Total Distance Covered / Speed

Calculation:
Total Distance Covered = 5,280 + 633,600 * (1/120) feet = 5,280 + 5,280 feet = 10,560 feet
Total Time taken = Total Distance Covered / Speed = 10,560 / (120 * 5280) hour = 10,560 / 633,600 hour = 1 / 60 hour = 1 minute / 60 = 1 second.

  If a train takes exactly 3 seconds to enter a tunnel of 1 mile, the length of the train (L) is equal to the length of the tunnel minus the distance covered by the front of the train during this time. 
  The speed of the train is 120 miles an hour.
  To find the length of the train (L), we need to convert the speed in miles per hour to miles per second. 
  The formula for speed is: distance / time.
  The distance covered by the train to pass completely through the tunnel is the length of the train plus the length of the tunnel.
  We will use these concepts to find the answer.
  
Calculation: 
  - Convert the speed of the train to miles per second: 120 miles/hour = 120/3600 miles/second ≈ 0.0333 miles/second.
  - The distance covered by the front of the train in the 3 seconds it takes to enter the tunnel is: 0.0333 miles/second × 3 seconds = 0.1 miles.
  - The length of the train is: 1 mile - 0.1 miles = 0.9 miles.
  - The total distance covered by the train to pass completely through the tunnel is: 1 mile + 0.9 miles = 1.9 miles.

  If an express electrical train takes 3 seconds to enter a 1-mile tunnel, it means the length of the train is 1 mile as well as the tunnel.
  We know that speed of train is 120 miles per hours.
  We need to find time taken by the train to pass the tunnel completely.
  To get the time, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  distance in this case is the total distance that train covers to completely pass through the tunnel and it is twice the length of the tunnel since the train must cover the distance it takes to enter and exit the tunnel completely.
  We can estimate the time and select the most probable answer.
  
Calculations:
  Distance covered by train to pass through tunnel completely = 1 mile + 1 mile = 2 miles
  Speed of train = 120 miles per hour

If we can find how many defective and non-defective staplers were produced, then we can find the total number of staplers produced.

Thus, remaining 90% or 90 staplers were non-defective.
2% of the 90 non-defective staplers were rejected, i.e., 2/100 x 90 = 1.8 staplers. 
It is given that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake.
So, 1.8 staplers were mistakenly rejected out of every 90 staplers.

First, we need to determine the number of defective staplers produced. If 10% of the staplers produced are defective then 90% are non-defective.

The number of non-defective staplers is 0.9x.

Now, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected. 
So, the number of rejected non-defective staplers is (2/100) * 0.9x = 0.018x.

We are given that the number of rejected non-defective staplers was 72.

  Let's try to breakdown the information given:
  Defective staplers produced on Monday = 10% of the staplers produced on Monday
  Non-defective staplers produced on Monday = 90% of the staplers produced on Monday
  2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake
  72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected
  We can use a system of equations to represent this situation.
  Let D = defective staplers and N = non-defective staplers
  We know that D + N = total number of staplers produced on Monday.
  We also know that 10% of D is defective and 2% of N is defective. We can represent this as 10/100D and 2/100N respectively.
  We also know that 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected so we can represent this as 2/100N = 72.
  We can use these equations to solve for the total number of staplers produced.
  
Action: Answer(""B"")  4200. 

Explanation:
  Let's start by solving for the non-defective staplers produced on Monday:
  2/100N = 72
  N = 72 * 100 / 2
  N = 3600
  This means that the total number of staplers produced on Monday is:
  D + N = Total
  10/100D + 3600 = Total
  We can simplify this by multiplying both sides by 10:
  D + 36000 = 10Total
  We know that the total number of staplers produced cannot be less than 3,600, so let's try the answer choices.
  If we plug in 4,000 for the total, we get:
  D + 36000 = 10(4000)
  D + 36000 = 40,000
  D = 4,000
  However, this means that the total number of defective staplers is 400, which is 10% of 4,000. This leaves 3,600 non-defective staplers, and if 2% of those were rejected, that would be 72 staplers, which matches what we were given. Therefore, the answer is B: 4,200.

  Substituting for H and L, we get T + 2x - (2x - H) = S.

- Since there are z students in the class, and we are excluding 2 students (highest and lowest scorers), there are (z - 2) students whose scores contribute to s.
- We can represent this fact using the equation s = y(z − 2).
- We know that the sum of all the scores can also be represented as (h + l) + s.
- The sum of all scores excluding the highest and lowest scores will be s = y(z – 2) and the number of students whose scores we used to calculate it is z - 2.

  s = yz - (h + l) = yz - 2x

  The space shuttle travels 700 m high in 40 seconds, which is the same as the height of the shuttle.
  Therefore, the height of the shuttle is 700 m.
  It takes the shuttle 5 seconds to pass a point. This means that the shuttle traveled some distance horizontally in that time.
  Let's find the shuttle's horizontal distance traveled when it reached a height of 700 m, which is the maximum height it can travel.
  Using the formula: 
  distance = speed × time
  Let speed be S, and time be T. We can rewrite the first equation as:
  700 = S × 40
  S = 700/40
  S = 17.5 m/s
  Therefore, the horizontal distance traveled after 5 seconds is:
  distance = speed × time
  distance = 17.5 m/s × 5 s
  distance = 87.5 m
  Therefore, the length of the space shuttle is the Pythagorean sum of its height and the horizontal distance it travels when it reaches its maximum height.

  To solve this problem, we need to assume that the space shuttle had already reached its maximum speed when it was passing the point. 
  Distance = Speed × Time
  The height the space shuttle travels in 40 seconds = 700m.
  Therefore, space shuttle's vertical speed is 700/40 = 17.5 m/s. 
  The speed is constant throughout, which means that it would travel for an additional 5 seconds before landing, so the total time is 45 seconds. 
  So, the length of the shuttle = Speed × Time.
  We know the vertical speed is 17.5 m/s, however, we do not yet know the horizontal speed of the shuttle.
  But, from the statement ""It will take 5 seconds to pass the point,"" we can say that the horizontal distance traveled in 5 seconds is equal to the length of the shuttle.
  And, the horizontal distance traveled = horizontal speed × 5 seconds
  So, the length of the shuttle is: vertical speed × (total time) + horizontal speed × 5 seconds.
  We need to find the horizontal speed to determine the length of the shuttle.
  
  Using Pythagoras theorem, 

                   (hypotenuse)² = (vertical)² + (horizontal)²
              
                   horizontal = √((hypotenuse)² - (vertical)²)
                   
  So, horizontal speed = √((700/tan(θ))² - 700²) where θ is equal to the angle of elevation of the shuttle at the maximum height.
  Then, the length of the shuttle = vertical speed × (total time) + horizontal speed × 5 seconds.

We can find the speed using: speed = distance/time
We have the distance and the time for the vertical ascent and descent, but not for the horizontal displacement. We can solve for the horizontal displacement using the Pythagorean theorem a^2 + b^2 = c^2 where a is the horizontal displacement, b is the vertical displacement and c is the hypotenuse.

Let's assume that the length and the two widths are x, y, and z respectively. So, we have:

xy = 240        (1)
x + 2z = y + 10  (2)

We want to find the length of fencing needed, which is equal to the sum of all three sides except the unfenced one. Therefore:

fencing = 2x + 2y + 2z - 10
fencing = 2(x + y + z) - 10

We can solve for x and z in terms of y using equation (2):
x = y - 2z + 10            (3)
z = (y - x + 10) / 2       (4)

Substitute (3) and (4) into (1):

(y - 2z + 10) * y = 240
y^2 - 2zy + 10y - 240 = 0
y^2 - (20 - 5z)y - 240 = 0

Using equation (4), we can obtain:

y^2 - (20 - 5(y - x + 10) / 2)y - 240 = 0
y^2 - 5y + xy - 140 = 0

Since we know xy = 240, we have:

y^2 - 5y + 240 - 140 = 0
y^2 - 5y + 100 = 0
(y - 10)(y - 10) = 0

y = 10

x = z = 5

  Amount remaining = (previous amount) * (2/3)
  At 9 am, the dog had eaten the first part of dog food which was (1/3) of the dog food. Thus, there was (2/3) of the original amount left in the bowl.
  At 10 am, the dog consumed (1/3) of (2/3) of the original amount (since it already ate (1/3) * (1/3) of the original amount). Thus, there was (2/3) * (2/3) of the original amount left in the bowl.
  Similarly, at 11 am, the dog consumed (1/3) of (2/3) * (2/3) of the original amount. Thus, there was (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) of the original amount left in the bowl.
  At 12 n, the dog consumed (1/3) of (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) of the original amount. Thus, there was (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) of the original amount left in the bowl.
  To find the percentage of dog food left in the bowl, we convert the remaining amount to percent as follows:
  Percent = (amount remaining) / (original amount) * 100 
  Percent = [(2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3) * (2/3)] / 1 * 100

300 = 0.85P * (original number of articles + 5)
352.94 = original number of articles + 5
original number of articles = 347.94
Now, let's calculate the new selling price of each article:
New selling price = 0.85P
New selling price = 0.85 * (total amount spent / (original number of articles + 5))
New selling price = 0.85 * (300 / (347.94 + 5))
New selling price = 0.85 * (300 / 352.94) 
New selling price ≈ $10

Therefore, the new selling price of each article is approximately $10, which is Choice B.

If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, this means she can buy a total of (5+x) articles where x is the original number of articles she was able to buy before the price reduction.
If the price of each article decreased by 15%, then Anna is only paying 85% of the original price per article.
We can create an equation using the information provided. The equation would be: 

(5 + x)(0.85p) = 300
where p is the original price of each article.

Solving the equation for p, we get:

p = 300 / ((5 + x) * 0.85)

Substituting x for p-5, we get:

p = 300 / ((p-5+5) * 0.85)

p = 41.18

   If the price of each article has decreased by 15%, it means the price left is 100%-15% = 85% of the original price
   Let the original price of each article be x
   if the new price of each article is 85% of x, that is 0.85x
   Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300, which means that 0.85x * (number of articles + 5) = $300
   We can solve for x by dividing by the number of articles + 5, and then solve for the new price by multiplying x with 0.85
   Let's solve for x and then the new selling price of each article

  If the original price of each article is x, after a 15% deduction, the new price will be 0.85x.
  With this deduction in price, Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300. 
  Therefore, the equation for this scenario can be written as (5+x)(0.85x) = 300

Anna can buy 5 more articles after the price decreased by 15%.
For her to be able to buy 5 more articles at the new price, the total amount spent at the new price is $300.
Let's assume that the original price of each article is ""p"" and since the price was decreased by 15%, the new selling price of each article is 0.85p.
Anna is now able to buy 5 more articles at the new price of 0.85p. 
Therefore, the equation of the new spending is 5*0.85p + 300 = total new spending.
We can simplify that to 4.25p + 300 = total new spending.
Since the amount spent on each article has to be the same, we need to divide the total amount by the number of articles. 4.25p = (total new spending - 300). Since 4.25p is the amount spent on each article and p is the original price, p = (total new spending - 300)/4.25.

P = 1.6W
The appliance was sold for 20% less than the original retail price, which can be written as 0.8P
Let S be the actual sale price
S = 0.8P = 0.8(1.6W) = 1.28W
The difference between the sale price and the wholesale cost is S - W = 1.28W - W = 0.28W.
To find the percent more than the wholesale cost, we need to divide the difference by the wholesale cost and convert to a percent:
0.28W / W * 100% = 28%

  If we fold the rectangular sheet into two equal halves, then we have two rectangles that are congruent to each other.
  Let x and y be the dimensions of the rectangular sheet.
  Folding along one set of sides means that the width is halved (x/2), and the length stays the same (y). Therefore, the perimeter of one part is 2(x/2 + y) = x + 2y. We know that this is equal to 48cm, so we can write the equation: x + 2y = 48.
  Folding along the other set of sides means that the length is halved (y/2), and the width stays the same (x). Therefore, the perimeter of one part is 2(x + y/2) = 2x + y. We know that this is equal to 66cm, so we can write the equation: 2x + y = 66.
  We have two equations: 
    x + 2y = 48
    2x + y = 66
  We can solve for x and y by using elimination (multiply the first equation with 2 and subtract from the second equation) or substitution (solve one equation for one variable and substitute into the other equation).
  I will use substitution.
  From the first equation, we can solve for x: x = 48 - 2y.
  Substituting x into the second equation:
    2(48 - 2y) +y = 66
    96 - 4y + y = 66

Let's assume the length and width of the rectangular sheet be ""l"" and ""w"", respectively.
When folded horizontally, the perimeter of each part would be equal to l + (w/2) + l + (w/2) = 2l + w.
When folded vertically, the perimeter of each part would be equal to w + (l/2) + w + (l/2) = 2w + l.
If 2l + w = 48, then l = (48 - w)/2.
If 2w + l = 66, then substituting the value of l, w = (66 - l)/2 = (66 - ((48 - w)/2))/2.
Simplifying the above equation for w, we get: 3w = 84 - l.
Substituting the value of l, we get: 3w = 84 - ((48 - w)/2).

  Let's suppose that the length of the rectangle is ""l"" and the width is ""w"".
  When folded along w, the two parts formed would have a perimeter of 66cm.
  If w is the shorter side and l is the longer side, then each part would have a length of (l/2) and a perimeter of 66cm. 
  Hence, 2(l/2) + 2w = 66 ⇒ l + 2w = 66
  Similarly, when folded along l, the two parts formed would have a perimeter of 48cm.
  Each part would have a width of (w/2) and a perimeter of 48cm. 
  Hence, 2(l + w/2) = 48 ⇒ l + w = 48
  We can now solve these two equations by eliminating ""l"".
  l + 2w = 66, subtracting w from both sides gives l = 66 - 2w.
  Substituting this value of ""l"" in the 2nd equation gives 66 - 2w + w = 48.
  Solving this equation for w gives w = 18.
  Using w = 18, we can find l: l + w = 48 ⇒ l = 30.
  Therefore, the area of the rectangle is lw = 18 x 30 = 540.
  However, we need to find the area of the sheet before it was folded.
  When folded along w, the rectangle was divided into two squares such that lw = area of rectangle = 540.

- Since 4 of them did not show up, the remaining number of friends is x - 4

Let's assume that n friends actually turned up.
So, the Cost of eatables per person would have been Rs. 96/n.
Since 4 friends did not turn up, the remaining friends had to share the food bill and spend Rs. 4 extra per person.
i.e. The new cost of eatables per person became Rs. 96/(n-4)+4.
We can now set up an equation: 
  96/n = 96/(n-4) + 4
  Multiplying both sides with n(n-4), we get
  96(n-4) = 96n + 4n(n-4)
  96n - 384 = 96n + 4n^2 - 16n
  Simplifying this equation we get,
  4n^2 - 16n - 384 = 0
  n^2 - 4n - 96 = 0
  This an equation of a quadratic which can be factored as
  (n-12)(n+8) = 0

Let's assume there were ""n"" friends initially, and all of them paid equally ""x"" amount of money for the picnic.
According to the problem:
  Total money spent on eatables = Rs. 96
  Amount contributed by each person initially = x
  As 4 of them did not turn up, the money collected equals (n-4)x
  Each of the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra. Therefore, the total money collected was:
  (x+4)(n-4) = 96
  nx - 4x - 4n + 16 = 96
  nx - 4(x+n) = 80
  We also know that Amount contributed by each person initially = x
  Therefore, x = 96/n

  Substituting, 96 = (96/n + 4) * (n-4)
  96 = 96 - 384/n + 4n -16
  384/n - 4n = -80
  96/n - n = -20
  n^2 + 20n - 96 = 0

Let's start by assuming that everyone showed up at the picnic. In that case, the cost per person would be Rs. 96 divided by the total number of friends. 

Now, we know that four friends didn't show up, so the actual cost per person would be Rs. 4 more than the assumed cost per person. 

Let's represent the total number of friends as 'x', then the cost per person would be:

Since every one of the remaining people contributed Rs. 4 extra, the total cost was (96 + 4*(x-4)).

To answer this question, we need to think about the minimum possible number of students who could have taken Physics and Math. Since we know that 20% took Physics and 28% took Math, we can assume that some students took both subjects. 

Let's assume that the number of students who took both subjects is x. Then the number of students who took only Physics is 20% - x, and the number of students who took only Math is 28% - x. 

We can then write an equation that represents the total number of students in the school: 

Total number of students = x + (20% - x) + (28% - x) + (students who took neither subject)

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

Total number of students = 48% - x + (students who took neither subject)

We know that the total number of students is greater than 501. So: 

48% - x + (students who took neither subject) > 501

We want to find the minimum possible number of students. This occurs when the number of students who took neither subject is minimized. Assuming that everyone in the school took at least one of the subjects, the minimum number of students who took neither subject is 0. 

So we can rewrite the inequality as: 

48% - x > 501

Solving for x, we get: 

x < 28%

So the minimum possible value of x is 27.99%. We can assume that this number is rounded up to the nearest whole student, so the minimum number of students who took both subjects is 28. 

Plugging this back into the original equation, we get: 

Total number of students = 28 + 20% - 28 + 28% - 28 + (students who took neither subject)

Total number of students = 20% + 28% - 28 + (students who took neither subject)

Total number of students = 20% + 28% + 72 students

  The problem involves distance, rate, and time.
  We know that the two cars travel in the same direction.
  When two objects travel in the same direction, their relative speed equals the difference between their respective speeds.
  If we let t be the time that has elapsed since the two cars started driving, then the distance between them is given by their relative speed times t.
  Therefore, we need to solve the equation 55t - 52t = 15.
  By simplifying, we get 3t = 15, and hence t = 5.

To find out how much time will pass before the cars are 15 miles away from each other, we have to figure out how long the faster car will take to get 15 miles ahead of the slower car. 
Let's call the time it takes for this to happen ""t"". 
In time ""t"", the first car will travel (55 mph * t) miles, and the second car will travel (52 mph * t) miles.
Since the second car is starting 15 miles behind the first car, the first car needs to travel (15 + distance travelled by the second car) to be 15 miles apart.
Thus, we can write an equation:
  55t = 52t + 15
  Simplifying and solving for t:
  3t = 15
  t = 5

  We know that the cars are moving in the same direction and that we need to find the time when they are 15 miles apart. 
  To do this, we can subtract the speed of the slower car from the faster car to find the relative speed of both cars i.e., 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.
  Therefore, the distance between the two cars is increasing by 3 miles per hour.
  To find how long it will take for them to arrive at a distance of 15 miles we can divide the distance of 15 miles by the relative speed of 3 mph.

  Let's call the distance between the two cars ""d"".
  The first car travels at a rate of 55 mph, which means it creates a separation of 55 mph.
  The second car travels at a rate of 52 mph, which means it creates a separation of 52 mph.
  The relative speed of the two cars (how quickly they are separating from each other) is the difference between their speeds, which is 55 mph - 52 mph = 3 mph.
  For the cars to be 15 miles apart, the second car would need to travel a distance of 15 miles less than the first car.
  Therefore, we can set up the following equation: d = 55t - 52t + 15, where ""t"" is the time in hours.
  Simplifying the equation gives: d = 3t + 15.
  We need to find out how much time needs to pass before the cars are 15 miles apart, which means we need to solve for ""t"".
  Plug in ""d = 15"" into the simplified equation: 15 = 3t + 15.
  Solving for ""t"" gives: t = 0.

  The distance between the two cars decreases at a rate of 55-52=3 mph.
  To be 15 miles away, the first car has to travel the same distance as the second car + 15 miles
  If we let x be the additional distance travelled by the first car after t hours, y as the distance travelled by the second car after t hours, then
  x = y + 15   (the distance formula)
  3t = y, since the speed of the second car is 52 mph
  Substituting y with 3t in the first equation we get
  x = 3t + 15
  To find the time it will take for the first car to travel x distance, we use the formula:
  time = distance / speed.
  speed of the first car = 55 mph
  time = (3t + 15) / 55
  We need to find t when x = 15 miles. So we solve for t:
  (3t + 15) / 55 = 15
  3t + 15 = 825

  We need to analyze the relationship between L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  Notice that [x+y] is either [x]+[y] or [x]+[y]+1
  In general, |[x] - [2x]| ≤ 1 and |[y] - [2y]| ≤ 1
  So, L(x,y) takes only one of the values 2[x]+2[y], 2[x]+2[y]+1, or 2[x]+2[y]+2.
  Further, because R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y] takes integer values only. 
  Therefore, we can check whether there any two integers that satisfy the given conditions. If there are no such values, then there are no such values among the positive real numbers.
  We proceed to substitute L(x,y) and R(x,y) respectively, and using the inequality properties to derive the answer.
  
  Let's start with L(x,y) = 2[x] + 2[y] = R(x,y)

    [x] = 1, [y] = 2, [x+y] = 4, [2x] = 2, [2y] = 5.

Let us assume the cost price of the watch is 'C'.
The shopkeeper sells it at a marked price of 'M'.
The shopkeeper first gave a 5% discount. So, the selling price became:
  S1 = M - 0.05*M
     = 0.95*M
   
Then, the shopkeeper gave a 7% discount. The selling price now became:
  S2 = M - 0.07*M
     = 0.93*M

We are also told that the profit earned after the first discount was x. After the second discount, the profit earned is 15 less. This can be written as;
  Profit after first discount = Profit after second discount + 15
  0.95M - C = 0.93M - C + 15
  0.02M = 15
  M = 15/0.02

  Let the cost price of the watch be C and marked price be M.
  The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, this implies that the selling price is 95% of the marked price. 
  Selling price after the 5% discount = 0.95M.
  Given, If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit.
  Profit on the watch before the discount of 5% = M - C
  Profit on the watch after the discount of 7% = (0.93M - C), where 0.93M is the selling price after the 7% discount.
  He earns Rs. 15 less as profit: (M - C) - (0.93M - C) = 15

    Let the cost of the watch be 'x'
    The shopkeeper gives a 5% discount off the cost and makes a profit of (100-5)% = 95%
    Therefore, the selling price of the watch with 5% discount is (95/100) x
    The shopkeeper gives a 7% discount (additional 2% from 5%) and makes a profit of (100-7)% = 93%
    Therefore, the selling price of the watch with 7% discount is (93/100) x
    From the question, we know that the difference between the two selling prices is Rs. 15
    i.e (95/100)x - (93/100)x = 15
    x = 750
  The cost of the watch is Rs. 750.
  Let the marked price of the watch be 'y'.
  The selling price with a 5% discount is (95/100)y.

  Now, we need to adjust the area for the doors and windows. 
  We are given that the cost of the paper is Rs 2 per meter, and the paper is 50cm wide. That means the cost of the paper per sq.m is 4Rs (2Rs/m * 0.5m).
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so it will cost a total of 60Rs (15sq.m * 4 Rs/sq.m).
  The remaining area will cost a total of 200Rs (260 - 60). 
  The remaining area is (10x^2 - 15) sq.m.

  Let's suppose that the height of the room is '2x' and the perimeter of the room is '2(5y-1)x' where y is the width of the room.
  The semi-perimeter of the room would be (5y-1)x.
  The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  So, 2(5y-1)x = (5y-1)2x + 5(2x).
  By solving the equation 'y' will come to be equal to 8.          
  Therefore, the length of the room would be 15 meters.
  Cost of papering the walls of the room will be 2200 rupees.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq. meters so the area of the 4 walls will be (2x + 5y) * 15 sq. meters.
  Area per meter cost of papering the wall will be 2/0.5 = 4 rupees/sq. meters.
  The height of the room can be calculated by dividing the total area of the room with the total wall space to be covered.
  The height of the room is (2200-15*4)/15*[(2*15/5)+(5*8)] = 4m.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 4m.

Let's use x to represent the height of the room
Semi-perimeter = (length + breadth + height)/2
Let y be the perimeter of the room, then y/2 = (length + breadth + height)/2 => y = length + breadth + height
We know that height to semi-perimeter ratio is 2/5
height/((y/2)) = 2/5
height= (2/5) * (y/2)
To find y, first find the area of the room without doors: 
Area of walls = 2*height*(length+breadth)
Area of doors and windows = 15m^2
Total Area = Area of walls - Area of doors and windows
Total Area = (2*height*(length+breadth)) - 15
Total cost = (Total Area * 2)/100
Total cost = 260
let's solve for length, breadth and height
Action: 

Let's begin by solving for the perimeter y
height = (2/5)*((y)/2)
Height = (2/5)*(y/2)
Height = (y/5)
Let w represent the breadth and l represent the length and h represent the height.
Area of the walls of the room = 2 x h(l + w)
Total Area = 2 x h(l + w) - 15
Total cost in Rs = (Total Area x 2) /100
Total cost in Rs = 2 x (2 x h(l + w) - 15) /100
Total cost in Rs = (4 x (h(l + w) - 15)) /100

For width of 50 cm of paper, 1 meter of paper would be required for 2 linear meters, so for length l + w, width of paper will fit (l + w)/0.50 times 
Total cost in Rs = [(l + w) /0.50] x 2 x 260 /100 = 26 x (l + w)
Total cost in Rs = (4 x (h(l + w) - 15)) /100
Therefore, (l + w) = 10 x (2h + 15) / 13

Substituting this in height equation: 
height = (y/5)
y = 2(length + breadth + height)
y = 2(l + w + h)
y = 2[(10/13) x (2h + 15) + h]
y = 4h/13 + 30/13

Substituting for Area:
Total Area = 2(h(l + w)) - 15
Total cost in Rs = (Total Area x 2)/100
(2(h(l + w)) - 15) = 130 x (h + 15)/13

Substituting in height:
2(sum * 10/13) (h) - 15 = 130(h + 15) / 13
h = 3.9m

  Let x be one number and y be the other number.
  We are given ""the difference between the squares of two numbers is 256000"", so can write x^2 - y^2 = 256000.
  We are also given ""the sum of the numbers is 1000"", so we can write x + y = 1000.

  We can manipulate the second equation to give us y = 1000 - x.

  We can set up an equation to solve for the number of sales.
  Let n be the number of sales.
  The amount of commission on each sale is 10% of $250 = $25.
  The total commission earned after n sales would be 25n.

- We subtract cba from abc to get 99(a-c)b + 396c = 990
- Simplifying, we get 3(a-c)b + 12c = 30, which reduces to (a-c)b + 4c = 10
- Since a should be greater than c, we can deduce that a-c cannot be 0 and should be at least 1
- Thus, to satisfy the equation above, we need b to be a factor of 10-4c, which reduces the possibilities significantly
- For a given value of c, there are only a few values of b that satisfy the equation. We can find them by plugging in each value of b from 0-9 and checking if the equation is satisfied.

- Since M > N, we know that a > c.
- We know that M = 100a + 10b + c, and N = 100c + 10b + a.
- Then M - N + 396c = (100a + 10b + c) - (100c + 10b + a) + 396c = 99a - 99c + 397c = 99a + 298c.
- So 99a + 298c = 990.
- Since a and c are digits, we can determine their possible values by trying out different values for a and seeing what c would need to be in order to satisfy the equation.
- When we try a = 3, we get c = 1, which gives us the smallest value of M, which is 310.
- The largest possible value of M is when a = 9, which would give us a value of 990.
- Therefore, we know that M is a three digit number that can take values between 310 and 990.
- To count the number of values of M that are more than 300, we can subtract the number of values of M that are less than or equal to 300 from the total number of values of M.
- There are 7 possible values of a that would make M less than or equal to 300 (namely, a = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7), and for each of those values of a, there is only one possible value of c that would make M a three digit number (namely, c = 0). So there are 7 values of M that are less than or equal to 300.

  Because a, b, and c are digits, we can find the possible values of a, b, and c by using the inequalities:

  M = abc, so a, b, c are digits such that (1 <= a, b, c <= 9) and a, b, c are not necessarily distinct.
  N = cba, so the digits of N are the reverse of the digits of M.
  We see that M - N  = 99(a-c) > 0, by the condition M > N results in a > c.
  Furthermore, we have M - N + 396c = 990, or (a - c)(100 - 9c) = 11(90 - 4c), and since 11 is a prime number, 
  this equation implies that either a - c = 11k and 100 - 9c = (90 - 4c)/k for some integer k >= 1, or a - c = (90 - 4c)/k
  and 100 - 9c = 11k for some integer k >= 1. It follows that if we fix c, then there is at most one value of k such

  If c is equal to 0, (M-N)/99 = a and a is greater than c, therefore a could be 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. This will give the values for M as 201, 312, 423, 534, 645, 756, 867 or 978, which means there are 8 values more than 300.

    Similarly, we can write N as N = 100c + 10b + a.
  - Since M > N, we know that a > c. So let's subtract N from M and simplify:
      M - N = 99a - 99c = 99(a - c)
      M -N +396c = 99(a - c + 4c) = 99(a + 3c) = 990
      a + 3c = 10
  - Since a and c are digits, the only solutions to this equation are a = 7 and c = 1 or a = 6 and c = 2
  - Let's substitute these values of a and c into our expression for M and see which values of M are greater than 300:
      * If a = 7 and c = 1, then M = 100a + 10b + c = 100(7) + 10b + 1 = 701 + 10b
        M > 300 when 701 + 10b > 300, which means b > -40.1
        Since b is a digit, b must be at least 0, which means there are 41 possible values of b that satisfy the inequality.
      * If a = 6 and c = 2, then M = 100a + 10b + c = 100(6) + 10b + 2 = 602 + 10b
        M > 300 when 602 + 10b > 300, which means b > -30.2

  The total investment made by all three -- A, B, and C -- is Rs.220,000.
  Profit is shared in the ratio of investment multiplied by time.
  Let's find out the ratio of their investments using the principle of equivalence: the product of the means is equal to the product of the extremes. 
  Therefore, (40000*12):(60000*t):(120000*(12-t+ ?)) = 2:5:10 (after simplification).
  Hence, 480000 : 60000t : 1440000 - 120000t = 2:5:10 (simplifying again).
  If we multiply everything by 5, then we get: 
  2400000 : 300000t : 7200000 - 600000t = 10:25:50
  240 : 30t : 720 - 60t = 1:5:10
  We know that C received 1/5th of the total profit, so C's investment multiplied by the time must be 1/5th of the total investment multiplied by the time. We know that C received Rs.150,000 as share and the total profit is Rs.375,000, therefore the total investment multiplied by 12 is: (150000/375000) * (220000 * 12) = 1056000. 
  Hence, the time taken by C is  (1056000 / 120000) - 10 = 1 year - 2 months = 10 months. 
  Therefore, C joined 10 months after B joined. 
  The answer is B: 4 months.

  Let's call the time for which A had invested as T1.
  B joined 2 months later so his invested time is T1-2.
  C joined after some more time, so let's call it T2 and his invested time is T1+T2-2.
  The profit ratio of A, B and C is 4:6:12.
  Let's call the total time for which the business was established as T.
  Total invested capital is 40000*12 + 60000*(12-2) + 120000*(12-T1-T2) = 480000 + 480000 - 120000T1 - 120000T2.
  Total profit is 48000*A_ratio + 72000*B_ratio + 144000*C_ratio = 375000.
  Since C's share is 150000, we can say that C's profit ratio is 4.
  Thus, A's and B's profit ratio combined is 2.
  Therefore, we can create the equation 48000*2 + (T-T1-2)*72000*(3/5) + (T-T1-T2-2)*144000*(1/5) = 225000.

  A invested the entire Rs. 40,000 for the year.
  B invested Rs. 60,000 for 10 months (because he joined the business 2 months after A did)
  C invested Rs. 120,000 for (12-x) months (since C joined the business after x months)
  We know that C received Rs. 150,000 as his share of the profit, which is the total profit multiplied by his share: 150,000 = (375,000*(120,000/220,000))

  The question involves the concept of ratios and proportions.
  C gets Rs. 150,000, which is 150,000/375,000 = 2/5 of the total profit.
  Let's assume that C was in the business for x months.
  A was in the business for the entire year. Thus, A's share of the profit is 5/12 of the total.
  B was in the business for (12-2) = 10 months. Thus, B's share of the profit is 1/3 of the total.
  C was in the business for (12-x) months. Thus, C's share of the profit is 2/5 of the total.
  Using the above information, we can set up an equation and solve for x.
  (2/5)*375,000 = 150,000 + (2/15)*375,000 + (5/12)*375,000
  150,000 = 44,000 + (5/12)*375,000 - (2/5)*375,000
  150,000 = 44,000 - 10,000 + (1/6)*375,000
  116,000 = (1/6)*375,000
  x = (12-2-10) + (10/3) + (2/5)*(12-x)

  The total profit is Rs. 375,000.
  C's share of the profit is Rs. 150,000.
  Therefore, the remaining share of profit with A and B is Rs. 375,000 - Rs. 150,000 = Rs. 225,000.
  The ratio of profit sharing between A, B and C is (40,000 x 12) : (60,000 x n) : (120,000 x m) where n and m are the number of months B and C worked in the business respectively.
  Further simplifying, the ratio is 2:3n:6m
  So, (3n+6m)/(2+3n+6m) = 225000/375000 = 3/5   --------- (1)
  Also, C worked after n months after B started working i.e. (n+m) months after A started working.
  Thus, (n+m) is the time period for which the business was run.
  As LHS of (1) is in fractional form, So, it can be written as (3/5) = p/(p+q) where p = 3n+6m and q = 2+3n+6m.
  Solving these two equations, we get m = 11.

  Let's name T the month C joined the business after A started.
  A invested for 12 months, B invested for 10 months (2 months had passed before he joined), and C invested for 12-T months.
  The share of C is greater or equal to zero and less or equal than the total profit: 0<=C<=375,000.
  Knowing that C's share is 150,000 and the sum of shares is 375,000, we can calculate A and B's total shared profit, which is 375,000-150,000=225,000.
  We can calculate the ratio of A's to B's invested capital as: (40000*12):(60000*10)=240:180=4:3.
  Using this ratio, we can calculate the total shared profit for A and B: 4k+3k=7k, which is 225000. Solving for k we have k=32,142.85.
  C's share is 150,000. Using the ratio above we can calculate that A's share is 4/7 of 225,000 minus 150,000, which is 42,857.15. B's share is 3/7 of 225,000 minus 150,000, which is 32,142.85.
  C invested for 12-T months. So C's share is proportional to 12-T.
  We can use the ratio of capital invested by A, B, and C to create the equation:
  4k*12 + 3k*10 + (12-T)*120k = 375000*12T/12

  Since the least integer is -50, then x = -50.
  We know the sum is 51.
  Now we can substitute these values into the formula and solve for k.
  Plugging the values we have, we get:
    51 = (k/2) * (2(-50) + (k - 1))
    102 = k(-100 + k - 1)
    102 = -k^2 + 99k - 100
    k^2 - 99k + 202 = 0
  Now we use the Quadratic Formula to solve for k:
    k = (-(-99) ± √((-99)^2 - 4(1)(202))) / (2(1))
  After calculating, we get two possible values for k:
    k ≈ 1.538 or k ≈ 97.462
  Since we are looking for the number of consecutive integers, k must be a positive integer.
  Therefore, the answer is k = 97.

We can start solving this problem by setting up an equation.
Let's assume that there are k number of consecutive integers starting from -50.
The sum of these k numbers is 51.
From the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence, we know that:
The sum of k consecutive integers starting from n is ((2n + k - 1) * k) / 2.
We can use this formula and substitute the given values into it to get the value for k.
((2(-50) + k - 1) * k) / 2 = 51
Simplifying this equation, we get:
(-100 + k - 1) * k = 102
Solve this quadratic equation we get k = 10.2 or k = -9.96.
Since we cannot have negative numbers of consecutive integers, the value of k can only be 10.

  The sum of k consecutive integers can be represented as k*(average of the integers).

  Therefore, the sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 can be represented by:

  Let's suppose that the consecutive integers start from x.
  Then, the second integer would be x + 1, the third would be x + 2, and so on.
  Since we are dealing with k consecutive integers, we can add the integer k - 1 to x to get the last integer in the sequence which would be x + (k - 1).
  Now we know that the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51.
  Therefore, (sum of the k consecutive integers) = k * ((2 * x + (k - 1)) / 2) = 51
  Simplifying this expression, we get the new equation: k * (2 * x + k - 1) = 102
  Also, we know that the least integer is -50.
  Therefore, we can say that x = -50.
  Substituting this value into the equation k * (2 * x + k - 1) = 102, we get the new equation: k * (-99 + k) = 102
  Simplifying this expression, we get a quadratic equation: k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0
  Factoring this expression, we get: (k - 3)(k - 96) = 0
  Therefore, k = 3 or k = 96

  We can start by using the fact that the area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  The area of a triangle is given by the formula: (1/2) * base * height,
  where the base and height are the two sides that meet at a right angle (also known as the legs).
  Since each triangle has an area of 70 square feet, we can write (1/2) * base * height = 70.
  Solving for the base, we get: base = (2 * 70) / height.
  From the given information, we know that the two triangles are congruent (i.e., they have the same shape and size).
  Therefore, the base and height of both triangles are equal.
  Solving for the base and height of one triangle, we get: base = (2 * 70) / height and height = (2 * 70) / base.
  Let's assume that the original square piece of cloth had a side length of x feet.
  When the cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge, the resulting rectangular piece has dimensions (x - 4) feet by x feet.
  When this rectangular piece is cut along its diagonal, we get two triangles with base and height given by: base = (2 * 70) / (x - 4) and height = (2 * 70) / x.
  Using the Pythagorean Theorem (a^2 + b^2 = c^2), we can find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular piece:
  diagonal^2 = (x - 4)^2 + x^2
  diagonal^2 = 2x^2 - 8x + 16
  diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 - 8x + 16)
  Since the two triangles are congruent, each has a base of (2 * 70) / (x - 4) feet and a height of (2 * 70) / x feet.
  Therefore, the perimeter of one triangle is given by: (2 * (2 * 70) / (x - 4)) + (2 * (2 * 70) / x)) = 280 / (x - 4) + 280 / x.
  The perimeter of the original square cloth is 4x feet.
  Hence, we can equate 4x to the perimeter of the two triangles, which is 2 * [(2 * 70) / (x - 4) + (2 * 70) / x], and solve for x.
  Simplifying this expression, we get: 4x = 560 / (x - 4) + 560 / x.
  Multiplying both sides by x(x - 4), we get: 4x^2 - 4x(x - 4) = 560x - 2240 + 560(x - 4).

  Let's assume the original side of the square cloth be 'x', then its area would be x^2 sq.ft.
  When 4 feet is cut from one side, then the new rectangle becomes (x)(x-4) sq.ft.
  Since triangles are formed by cutting the rectangle diagonally, we get two identical right-angled triangles, each having:
  base = one side of rectangle = x-4
  height = half of other side of the rectangle = 1/2 * x = x/2
  area of one triangle = (1/2) * base * height
  area = 70 sq.ft => 70 = (1/2) * (x-4) * (x/2)

  Let a be the length of square cloth.
  Since a square cloth is trimmed by 4 feet on one edge to form a rectangular piece, then the length of the rectangular piece is a - 4 and the width is a.
  The area of the rectangular piece is (a - 4) * a which is equal to a^2 - 4a.
  After the rectangular piece is cut diagonally in half to create two triangles, the area of each triangle is 1/2 * base * height, where the base of each triangle is a, and the heights are equal. Thus, the area of each triangle has to be 1/2 * a * h = 70, which gives h = 140/a.
  The Pythagorean theorem states that (a-4)^2 + (140/a)^2 = a^2.
  Simplifying this equation yields a^4 - 8a^3 + 1612a^2 - 6272a = 0. Factoring out a yields a(a^3 - 8a^2 + 1612a - 6272) = 0. We know a > 8 based on the original dimensions of the cloth.
  Only a = 64 satisfies a > 8, which means that the original square piece of cloth is 64 feet on each side.

  Let the original side of the square piece of cloth be `x` feet.
  The new rectangular piece has one side `x-4` feet and the other side still has `x` feet.
  The area of a triangle is `1/2 x base x height`.
  We have two identical triangles, so each triangle has base `(x-4)/2` feet and height `(sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2))/2` feet. We know the area of each triangle is 70 square feet. Therefore, we can use algebra to solve for `x`.
  70 = 1/2 x (x-4)/2 x sqrt(x^2 - (x-4)^2)/2
  70 = 1/4 sqrt(2x^3 - 8x^2 + 32x - 64)
  280 = sqrt(2x^3 - 8x^2 + 32x - 64)

  The area of each triangle can be found by (1/2) * base * height.
  The area of each triangle is 70 square feet.
  So, the base and height of each triangle must be 2 times the square root of 35.
  The length of the rectangular piece is the other side of the triangle, so it is also 2 times the square root of 35.
  The original piece was created by trimming 4 feet on one edge, so it has sides of x + 4, x, x, x where x is the length of a side of the square piece of cloth.
  The diagonal of the rectangular piece can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: 
  Diagonal^2 = (x+4)^2 + x^2
  Diagonal = sqrt(2x^2 + 16x + 16)
  The diagonal is also the hypotenuse of the 2 triangles.
  A triangle has sides a, b, c with hypotenuse c. If a and b are the legs, then a^2 + b^2 = c^2
  For each triangle, we know that one leg is equal to x and the other leg is equal to 2√35. Therefore:
  x^2 + (2√35)^2 = (sqrt(2x^2 + 16x + 16))^2
  x^2 + 140 = 2x^2 + 16x + 16
  Simplifying this equation results in x^2 - 16x + 124 = 0.
  We can solve for x using the quadratic formula:
  x = (16 +/- sqrt(16^2 - 4*1*124))/(2*1)
  x = 8 +/- 2sqrt(15)
  Since x is the length of a side of the square piece of cloth, it must be positive.
  Therefore, x = 8 + 2sqrt(15).
  The perimeter of the original piece is 4x.
  4x = 4(8 + 2sqrt(15)) = 32 + 8sqrt(15)

Let's assume that the square cloth has side length x.
The original square piece of cloth had area x^2.
After trimming 4 feet, the side length of the rectangular piece becomes x-4.
The diagonal of each triangle is equal to the length of the rectangle (x-4).
The diagonal divides the rectangle into two identical triangles.
The area of a triangle = base x height / 2.
Because each of the two triangles is identical, then we can find the height and base of one triangle.
    Let h and b be the height and base of one triangle.
    Then, h x b / 2 = 70
    Then, h x b = 140
    The right angle is between the diagonal and one side of the rectangle. Therefore, we have:
    h^2 + b^2 = (x-4)^2
    b = sqrt((x-4)^2 - h^2)
    h x sqrt((x-4)^2 - h^2) = 140
    We can substitute h by 140 / sqrt((x-4)^2 - h^2).
    h x sqrt((x-4)^2 - (140 / sqrt((x-4)^2 - h^2))^2) = 140
    Let's solve this equation numerically using Excel Solver.
    We find that h^2 = 700 - 50sqrt(51)
    We can approximate h by 7.8 feet
    We can approximate b by 19.2 feet by substituting h in the expression b = sqrt((x-4)^2 - h^2).
    
Therefore, the perimeter of the original square cloth was 4x.
    After trimming the cloth, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2*(x-4)+2x=3x-8.
    Therefore, the length of the diagonal is sqrt((3x-8)^2+2*(x-4)^2).

  Also, we know that the length of unpainted side is 9 feet.
  The perimeter of parking space is the sum of all sides which equals to 2a + b + 9.
  The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the length plus twice the width hence:
        2a + b + 9 = 2(a+c) + 9
              b = 2c - 9
  As we are interested in calculating the Area of rectangular parking space. We must consider the formula:
        Area = length × width
  We know that width is 9 feet and, the length is (a + c).
  Therefore, Area = (a+c) × 9.
  Finally, we need to solve for the values of a, b and c, which can be done by substituting b in the equation a + b + c = 37
       a + (2c -  9) + c = 37
       a + 3c = 46
       a = 46 - 3c
  We know that a + c = length

  Substituting the value of length in the Area formula
        Area = Width * Length
             = 9 * (a+c)
             = 9 * (46-2c)
             = 414 - 18c
  So, the Area of parking space is 414 - 18c.
  To solve for c, we can substitute the value of a in earlier derived equation
        b = 2c - 9
        b = 2(c + a - c) - 9
        b = 2(a + c) - 2c - 9

  Together hose A and B fill 1/8 + y of the pool in one hour.
  According to the problem, hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours, so: 
    - In 2 hours, hose A filled 2 x 1/8 = 1/4 of the pool.

  Then, if the pool is filled in 3 hours with both hoses working together:
    - In 1 hour hose A and B together fill (1/8 + y) of the pool.
    - So in 3 hours they can fill (1/8 + y) x 3 = 3/8 + 3y of the pool.

  The question states that the ratio of tagged deer in the sample (20) to the total number of deer in the sample (500) is equal to the ratio of tagged deer in the entire forest to the total number of deer in the forest (x). In other words, 20/500 = 300/x.
  Solving for x, x = (500*300)/20 = 7500.
  Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

- In 2001, 300 deer were tagged
- In 2002, 500 deer were caught, 20 of which were previously tagged
- The percentage of the 500 caught deer which were tagged during the 2nd year will be equal to the percentage of the total population with tags
- If we find that percentage and apply it to the total population, we can find the answer.

Calculation:
- The percentage of 500 caught deer which had tags from previous years is: (20/500)x100 = 4%
- This percentage is equal to the percentage of the total deer population who had tags.
- If x is the total deer population, then the 300 tagged deer is equal to 4% of the population:

  The total number of tagged deer in 2002 is 300 (the number of deer tagged in 2001) + 20 (the number of deer with tags in 2002 that were caught in 2001) = 320 total tagged deer in 2002.
  If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, we can set up the following equation:

Let the common remainder be ""x"" and the 3-digit number be ""N"".
We know that (2272-x) and (875-x) are divisible by N.
We know that 2272-x is greater than 875-x because 2272 is larger than 875.
So, N must be a factor of (2272-x)-(875-x) = (2272-875) which is 1397.
Possible values for N are 139, 199, and 997.
We can calculate the sum of the digits of each of these numbers.
Sum of digits of 139 = 13
Sum of digits of 199 = 19
Sum of digits of 997 = 25

If 2272 and 875 leave the same remainder when divided by the same 3-digit number N, then:
The difference of these numbers (2272-875=1397) is also divisible by that number N.
Question is asking for the sum of the digits of that 3-digit number N
We know that 100 ≤ N ≤ 999
We can try dividing 1397 by all such numbers N and checking which one satisfies this.
Applying divisibility rule for 11: Sum of alternate digits minus sum of remaining digits.
1397 is divisible by 11, so sum of alternate digits minus sum of remaining digits must be a multiple of 11
By trial and error, N = 29 satisfies the conditions and gives the same remainder.

Let R be the common remainder that we find when dividing 2272 and 875 by N where N is a three-digit number.
We know that:
  2272 ≡ R (mod N)         =>     2272 - R = kN
  875  ≡ R (mod N)         =>     875 - R = jN
  
 where k and j are some integers.
 Adding the above two equations, we get:
     2272 - R + 875 - R = (k+j)N
     3147 - 2R = N(k+j)

N divides 3147-2R. 

We have N is a three-digit number.
The digit sum of N should lie between 1 + 0 + 0 and 9 + 9 + 9 = 27.
If we check pairs (N, 3147-2R) that multiply to a multiple of 3147 such that N is a three-digit number and the digit sum of N lies between 1 and 27, we see that only one pair (N,3147-2R) satisfies the given equations: (N, 213).
If we add the digits of 213, we get 6.

  Let's assume that the total work takes 12 hours for Jack to complete, and he cleans at a rate of `1/12` per hour.
  On the particular day, Jack has completed two-thirds of the job. Therefore, one-third of the work is remaining.
  That means, Jack completed `(2/3) * (1/12)`, which is equal to `1/18`, in the time he worked.
  The remaining `(1 - 2/3)` or one-third of the work is assumed to be cleaned by Jill at the rate of `5%` of Jack, which is equal to `(1/20) * (1/12)` per hour.
  Let's assume the time required by Jill is `t` to complete the remaining work. So we can form the equation as:
  `Jill's rate * Jill's time + Jack's rate * Jack's time = 1`

  Jack’s work rate is 1/12. 
  Jill's work rate is 5% of Jack’s work rate = 1/20 * 1/12 = 1/240
  Jack completed two-thirds of the work which means 1/3 is left for Jill.

  Let's determine how long it takes Jack to finish the cleaning all by himself.
  Let's call the total time taken by both Jack and Jill together to finish the cleaning as T.
  Jack's work rate is 1 yacht / 12 hours = 1/12th yachts per hour.
  On that particular day, Jack finished two-thirds of the work.
  Therefore, the remaining one-third of the work was done by Jill.
  This means one-third of the work takes T time, and Jack takes 2/3 T time to complete.
  Jack's fraction of work is (2/3), and he does that work at a rate of (1/12)th yachts per hour.
  Let Q be the fraction of total work that Jill can do in one hour. Since she can do only 5% of what Jack can do, Q = 0.05 * (1/12) = 1/240.
  Let's now use the fact that the fraction of work depends on the time taken to do it.
  The total work is equal to one yacht. Hence, one-third of the yacht is equal to (1/3) yachts.
  Thus the fraction of work that Jill does is (1-2/3) = 1/3.
  Using the work formula:
  work = rate × time
  We can say that the total work done by Jack is:
  (2/3) * 1 yachts = (1/12)t * (2/3),
  where t is the time taken by Jack to finish the whole work alone.
  Solving this equation gives t =  8 hours.
  Now, we can calculate the time taken for Jill to finish one third of the work alone as follows:
  (1/3) yachts = (1/240) * t2,
  where t2 is the time taken by Jill to complete one-third of the work alone.
  Solving this equation gives t2 =  8 x 80 = 640 hours.
  But this answer does not correspond to any of the answer choices.
  This is because the answer choices are in hours when they should rather be in minutes.

  Suppose the yacht was cleaned by Jack in 12 hours. 
  On the particular day, he was able to clean two-thirds of the yacht. Therefore, the remaining third which Jill had to clean would take her a time equal to that which Jack would take to clean a third of the yacht, since Jack's and Jill's respective rates are directly proportional to the fraction of the yacht they cleaned.
  This means that Jill's rate is 5/100, which is equal to 1/20, of Jack's rate.
  Therefore, we can write an equation with the form: Time = Work / Rate.
  If Jack's rate is 1 and the portion of the yacht that remains is 1/3 of the total yacht then the time it takes Jil to finish the remaining part of the yacht is  (1/3) / ( 1/20 ) which equal, (1/3) * (20/1) which equals  20/3 hours of work.

  According to the problem, the diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin and 25 cents for each brass coin. 
  So, the amount she earns in cents can be represented as:
  20x + 25y = 340 cents
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought.
  Let's solve the above equation for x in terms of y.
    20x + 25y = 340
    20x = 340 - 25y
    x = 17 - (5/4)y
  
  From this equation, we can see that the value of x will be minimum when the value of y is maximum. 
  However, we need to make sure that x and y are both integers, and the total value of coins (x + y) is also a reasonable number.
  Let's start with the maximum possible value of y, which is 13.
  If y = 13, then x = 2 (using the above equation).
  The total value of coins is 15, which is reasonable (not too small or too big).

  Let's assume 'c' represents the copper coin and 'b' represents the brass coin.
  From the question, we know that for each copper coin the coin-diver brought from the bottom, she got 20 cents. Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins (c) she brought could be 0 because even with zero copper coins, she could still earn some amount of money with brass coins.
  Also for each brass coin, she got 25 cents, which means (340 - 25d) should be divisible by 20 if she brought 'd' numbers of brass coin and made '340 - 25d' cents. 
  Let's start with d = 0, 340 divisible by 20 so this is a potential answer.
  Let's try d = 1, 340 - 25 = 315 is not divisible by 20, so we can skip this.
  Let's try d = 2, 340 - 25(2) = 290, not divisible by 20 so we can skip this.

  The maximum number of brass coins she could get is 13, which is 340/25. If she gets 13 brass coins, then the remaining amount must be from copper coins. So, if y = 13, then x = (340 - 25y)/20 = 3.

To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step process:
- Let hundreds digit be ""a"", tens digit be ""b"", units digit be ""c"".
- The sum of the digits is 17: a+b+c=17. 
- The sum of the squares of the digits is 109: a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
- The number has to be divisible by 11 and hence, should appear in sequence 110, 121, 132, 143,  etc.
- Subtracting 495 from the number in those ranges, the last will be subtracted from the first. This last digit will be nine. 
- Therefore, possible digits are 3, 6, and 8.
- The digits of the number may be reverse. For example, if abc is the original number, so the new number is cba. 
- Thus, if abc - 495 = cba, then abc-cba=495.
- At this point, to find the value of abc, we have a system of three equations:
  1) a + b + c = 17
  2) a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109
  3) 99a - 99c = 495

  If we reverse the digits of ABC, our new number becomes CBA, which is equal to 495 + ABC. Thus, C - A = 4.

  Let us suppose that the three digits of the number are x, y and z.
  From the given information, we have:
  x + y + z = 17;          ---(1)
  x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 109;  ---(2)
  By subtracting 495 from the original number, we get another number consisting of the same digits in reverse order. This means that the difference between the two numbers is a multiple of 9. 
  Let us call the original number as xyz and the reversed number as zyx. Therefore, we can write:
  xyz - zyx = (100x + 10y + z) - (100z + 10y + x) = 99(x - z) = 9k (where k is any integer).
  From the above equation, we can say that (x - z) = k;           ---(3)
  x + z = y;                                                 ---(4)
  From (3) and (4), we can say that 2z + k = y;                ---(5)

  x + (2z + k) = 17;
  x + 2z + k = 17;                                           ---(6)
  By substituting (3) in (2), we get:

  2x^2 + 4kz + 5z^2 = 109;                                  ---(7)
  From (6), we have: x = 17 - 2z - k.
  By substituting x in (7), we get:
  2(17 - 2z - k)^2 + 4kz + 5z^2 = 109;
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  5z^2 + 8kz + 2k^2 - 34z + 2k + 9 = 0;                      ---(8)
  Since x, y and z are digits (0-9), we know that z can not be 0 or 1, otherwise, it would mean that x or y is negative. Therefore, z should be greater or equal to 2.
  We can test the possible values of z from 2 to 9 in equation (8), until we get integral values for k. 
  By testing, we get that if z = 7, then k = 1, which satisfies the condition.

  We know that:
  Total = 250
  virus & worm files = x
  worm files alone = 2.5x

  We also know that 50% of the files were not infected by a virus. This means 50% = not infected.
  Therefore, we can say that:
  not infected = 0.5(250) = 125
  
  We can plug in these values to solve for x:

We're looking to solve for the number of files not infected by a worm, so we need to find the number of files that were:

Not infected at all, OR
Infected by a virus only.

To solve this problem:
Total number of files = (infected by virus only) + (infected by worm only) + (infected by both)
A. The number of files infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both a virus and a worm. Hence, 
infected by worm only = 2.5 * infected by both
250 = (infected by virus only) + (infected by worm only) + (infected by both)
B. The number of files not infected by a virus is 50% of the total; hence:
not infected by a virus = 0.5 * 250

We can substitute the value of @infected by worm only in terms of infected by both from equation A to equation B. And we can solve for ""not infected by a worm"".
Equation A: 250 = (infected by virus only) + (2.5 * infected by both) + (infected by both)
=> 250 = (infected by virus only) + (3.5 * infected by both) 
Equation B: not infected by a virus = 0.5 * 250 = 125
total not infected files = not infected by virus only + files infected by none, hence:
not infected by virus only = 125 - files infected by none

  According to the problem: W-only = 2.5 * V∩W

  0.5V = number of files not infected by virus

  We have three unknowns, so we need one more equation to solve for each unknown. We are looking to find  files NOT infected by a worm. 
  
  If we find out W, then we can subtract W from 250 to get the number of files not infected by a worm.

  W-only + V∩W = 0.5V (From 0.5V = number of files not infected by virus)

  (number of files infected by both a virus and a worm) = 71.43 (rounded from 71.43)
  
  Next, we can find V:

  Let's denote the number of files infected ONLY by a virus, ONLY by a worm, and by BOTH by V, W, and B, respectively.
  We know that V + W + B = 250 (since that's the total number of files).
  We also know that W = 2.5B (since the number of files only infected by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files infected by both).
  We know that 50% of the files (i.e., 125 files) were NOT infected by a virus.
  That means the other 125 files were infected by a virus. We can use this information to set up an equation: V + B = 125
  
  We can solve for B in the second equation: W = 2.5B 
  B = W/2.5.
  
  Then substitute for B in the first equation: V + W + B = 250.
  So, V + W + W/2.5 = 250.
  We can simplify this equation to: 5V + 12W = 1250.
  
  We can solve this system of equations:
    V + B = 125  --------(1)
    5V + 12W = 1250 -------(2)
    
  Multiplying equation (1) by 2.5, we get:
    2.5V + 2.5B = 312.5.
    
  Adding this equation to equation (2), we get:
    7.5V + 14.5W = 1562.5.
    
  Solving for V using equation (1), we get:
    V = 125 - B.
    
  Substituting for V in the equation above, we get:
    7.5(125-B) + 14.5W = 1562.5.
    937.5 - 7.5B + 14.5W = 1562.5.
    14.5W = 625 + 7.5B.
    
  We know that B + W = (2.5+1)B = 3.5B (i.e. the total number of files that is infected with worm).
  So, W = 3.5B - B = 2.5B.
   
  Substituting for W in the equation above, we get:
    14.5(2.5B) = 625 + 7.5B.
    36.25B = 625 + 7.5B.
    28.75B = 625.
    B = 625/28.75 = 21.7391 (approx.).
    
  Now that we know B, we can find W since W = 2.5B.
    W = 54.3478 (approx.).
    
  We can also find V, since V+B = 125.
    V = 125 - B = 103.2609 (approx.).
    
  Therefore, the number of files NOT infected by a worm = V (since these files are only infected by a virus)

  If the original length of the ribbon is 30 cm, and the ribbon is reduced in the ratio of 5:3,
  This means the ribbon is reduced to 5/3 of its original length.
  To find the new length of the ribbon, we need to multiply the original length by the ratio of the reduction.
  So, the new length is (5/3) * 30 cm.
  We can simplify the expression to (5 * 30) / 3 cm.

  Total Distance Covered = Distance between X and Y

Let's suppose that the distance between X and Y is d.
Let's calculate when they meet for the first time.
Let t be the time they meet for the first time.
Using distance = speed x time, we have:
  Allen's traveled distance = 54 t
  Bob's traveled distance = 78t
  Distance between X and Y = d
We have two formulas for calculating the same distance:
  54t + 78t = d
  d = 132t

Let t' be the time they meet for the second time.
Using distance = speed x time again, we have:
  Allen's traveled distance = 54 (t' / 2) + 54 (t' / 2)
  Allen's traveled distance = 54t'
  Bob's traveled distance = 78 (t' / 2) + 78 (t' / 2) + 48
  Bob's traveled distance = 78t' + 48
  
Since they met again, Allen and Bob's total traveled distance is d
  54t' + 78t' + 48 = d
  132t' + 48 = d

d = 132t' + 48

Likewise, we have that
  d = 132t

By transitivity,
  132t' + 48 = 132t
  t' = (132 - 48) / (54 + 78)
  t' = 84 / 132
  t' = 0.64 hours

Hence the time taken by Bob to cover d + 48 km is t = (d + 48)/78 hours.

  Let's suppose the distance between X and Y is d km.
  Let's suppose both Allen and Bob meet for the second time at point Z km from X. 
  It means Allen will travel distance Z km twice (from X to Y, from Y to Z, and then back to X) that is 2Z km in total.
  Bob will travel distance (d - Z) km twice (from Y to X, from X to Z, and then back to Y) that is 2(d - Z) km in total.
  Allen's speed is 54 kmph. Therefore, Allen will travel the first Z km distance at a rate of 54 kmph in time t1 = Z/54 hours. Similarly, Allen will travel the 2Z km distance at a rate of 54 kmph in time t2 = 2Z/54 = Z/27 hours. The total time taken by Allen to travel the first Z km and then 2Z km is t = t1 + t2 = Z/54 + Z/27 hours.

  Bob's speed is 78 kmph. Therefore, Bob will travel the first (d - Z) km distance at a rate of 78 kmph in time t3 = (d - Z)/78 hours. Similarly, Bob will travel the 2(d - Z) km distance at a rate of 78 kmph in time t4 = 2(d - Z)/78 hours. The total time taken by Bob to travel the first (d - Z) km and then 2(d - Z) km is t' = t3 + t4 = (d - Z)/78 + 2(d - Z)/78 hours = 3(d - Z)/78 hours. 

  We know that Bob covers 48 km more than Allen at the time of their second meeting.
  Therefore, using the formula of distance = speed × time for both Allen and Bob at the time of their second meeting, we can say that:
  2Z/27 × 54 + (d - Z)/78 × 78 = 2(d - Z) + 48
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  2Z/27 + (d - Z)/39 = d/39 + 2/13
  26Z + 27d = 39Z + 78d + 936    (Multiplying both sides of the above equation by (27 x 39))
  13d = 13Z + 936
  d = Z + 72
  
  Therefore, the distance between X and Y (d) is 72 km more than the distance of the meeting point (Z) of Allen and Bob.
  To find Z, let's solve the following set of equations:
  2Z/27 + (d - Z)/39 = d/39 + 2/13
  d = Z + 72
  
  On solving the above set of equations, we get:

  Since Allen and Bob are starting from opposite ends and moving towards each other, they are moving at a combined speed of (54 + 78) kmph.
  Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d.
  From the question, we know that Bob covered 48 km more than Allen.
  Let the distance Allen traveled be x. So, the distance Bob traveled will be (x + 48) km.
  Using the formula distance = speed × time, we can calculate the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet each other for the first time. Let's call this time t1.
  So, t1 = (d / (54 + 78)) hrs.
  After the first meeting, both Allen and Bob change their directions and continue to travel.
  Using the same formula, we can calculate the time taken for both of them to meet for the second time. Let's call this time t2.
  So, t2 = (2d / (54 + 78)) hrs.
  Since we know that Allen's speed is 54 kmph, the distance he covers in time t2 is 54 × t2.
  And, the distance Bob covers in time t2 is (78 × t2 - 48). (Since Bob traveled 48 km more than Allen before their first meeting)
  We know that both of them covered the same distance after the first meeting.
  Therefore, 2x = 78t1 and x = 39t1.
  Using this equation we can replace x in terms of t1.
  Thus, 2 * 39t1 + 48 = 78t2 - 54t2

Let's call the distance from X to Y as D, the time it takes for them to meet for the first time as T, and the distance covered by Allen when they meet for the second time as A. From the problem:
- The distance covered by Bob when they meet for the second time will be A + 48km.
- The time it takes for them to meet for the first time is T = D / (54+78) (sum of their speeds)
- When they meet for the first time, they travel the same distance. So Allen travels 54T and Bob travels 78T
- When they meet for the second time, the previous distance is covered plus an additional distance that was covered by Allen alone, which is A. Therefore,
      2D + A = 54T + 78T + (78T - 54T) + (A + 48)
Simplifying the equation:
      2D + A = 6T(54 + 78) + A + 48
      2D = 4T(54 + 78) + 48
      D = 72 * (2T + 1)

The distance between X and Y is 72 * (2T + 1)
To solve for T, note that at the time of their second meeting, Allen and Bob together have covered a distance of 2D + A + 48. We already know that the time it takes for them to meet for the first time is T = D / (54+78), so Allen manages to cover a distance of 54 * T before turning back to X. When they meet for the second time, Allen has traveled twice the distance he covered in T, plus an additional distance A. So A = 2 * 54 * T

Substitute A into the equation for D:
      D = 72 * (2T + 1) = 2 * 54 * T + 72 * 2T
      D = 108T + 144T
      D = 252T
Then:
      2D + A +48 = 3D
      2(252T) + 2 * 54 * T + 48 = 3 * 252T
      540T = 48
      T = 48/540 = 8/90 = 4/45
Finally, we can substitute T into the expression for D to get the answer:

In D/132 hours, Allen will cover 54 * (D/132) km and Bob will cover 78 * (D/132) km. Hence, their respective distances from their starting points when they meet for the first time will be D - [54 * (D/132)] and [78 * (D/132)].

The distance travelled (d) is equal to the product of the speed (s), time taken (t) and the round trip (rt) factor which is calculated by dividing the total time taken (tt) with time taken for each one-way journey.
rt = tt / (t1 + t2)
where: 
t1 = time for forward journey
t2 = time for returning journey
tt = t1 + t2

In this problem, we know that the returning journey is faster than the forward journey. Therefore, we can use the following equations to solve the problem:
s2 = s1 + 12km/hr  (where: s1 is the speed of the forward journey, s2 is the speed of the returning journey)
t1 = 6hr
t2 = 4hr
tt = t1 + t2 = 10hr

Using rt = tt / (t1 + t2), we have rt = 10 / (6 + 4) = 1

Using d = s * t * rt, we have d = s1 * t1 * rt

  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the function describing the amount of water lilies on the lake at any time t can be written as N(t) = N0 * 2^(t/2), where N0 is the initial number of water lilies and t is measured in days.
  If it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies starting from one water lily, then the equation 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = N(60) = 1 * 2^(t/2) holds, where the left-hand side represents the final number of water lilies and the right-hand side represents it after t days starting from 1 lily.
  Solving the above equation yields t = 30*2 = 60, which is the expected result. 
  If the initial number of water lilies is 64, then the equation 2^(60/2) = 64 * 2^(t/2) holds.

- Therefore, the total time elapsed since the departure of Train M until the trains cross each other is 3.5 hours (9 am - 5:30 am).
- Next, we can calculate the relative speed of the trains. The combined distance traveled by the trains when they meet is equal to the distance between A and B. Let's assume this distance is d.
- Train M's speed = d/4 (distance traveled in 4 hours).
- Train N's speed = d/3.5 (distance traveled in 3.5 hours).
- The relative speed of the trains = Train M's speed + Train N's speed.
- The time taken for the trains to cross each other is equal to the distance between them divided by the relative speed of the trains.
- Let's assume the trains cross each other x hours after Train M's departure.
- Then, the distance traveled by Train M = d/4*x.
- The distance traveled by Train N = d/3.5(x - 2) (2 hours later than Train M).

  Let's assume that both trains were traveling at a constant rate or speed.
  Let's also assume that the distance between City A and City B is d. 
  At t hours, Train M has covered a distance of d. At the same time t hours, Train N has covered a distance of d - x (where x is the distance covered by Train N in the two hours between 7 am and 9 am).
  At some point, both trains will have covered the same distance, which we will call y.
  Using the formula above, we can write an equation:
      d = (speed of M) * 4
      d - x = (speed of N) * 3.5
      y = (speed of M) * t = (speed of N) * (t-2) + x
  We need to solve for t.
  First, we can solve for x by simplifying equations 1 and 2:
      (speed of M) = d/4
      (speed of N) = (d-x)/3.5
  Substituting into equation 3, we get:
      y = (d/4) * t = ((d-x)/3.5) * (t-2) + x
      14y = 3dt - 3.5xt + 7x
  Also, since the two trains meet at some point, we know that the distance each train covers before meeting is equal to y. So we can set up another equation:
      y = (speed of M) * (t - k) = (speed of N) * k, where k is the time Train N took to travel x distance between 7am and 9am.
      y = (d/4) * (t-k) = ((d-x)/3.5) * k

Initially, we have S kgs of sand and (0.7*(S/0.3)) kgs of clay in the mixture.
Let us assume that mass 'M' of the mixture is removed and replaced with pure sand.
After the replacement:

To make the mixture contain equal quantities of sand and clay, the weight of sand and clay should be equal. Therefore, we need to add 4 kg of sand to the mixture, so that the total sand in the mixture is now 7 kg.

When 'x' kg of the original mixture is replaced with pure sand, 7 kg of sand should be in the new mixture. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

Let y be the amount of pure sand to be added (in kg) to the new mixture. The percentage of sand in the new mixture after some amount is removed and replaced is given by:

Since the final mixture should have an equal amount of sand and clay, the percentage of clay in the new mixture after some amount is removed and replaced is given by:
[(7 - (10 - y))] / 10 = [(7 + y) / 10]

To make the percentage of sand equal that of the clay, we solve for y:

  Let's assume the length and the breadth of the rectangular plot as L and B respectively.
  We can write two equations from the given information:
  2(L + B) = 340   ...eq. 1, where perimeter is the sum of all sides of a rectangle
  The length of the garden including the breadth of the rectangular plot: L + 2 + B + 2 = L + B + 4 ...eq. 2
  The breadth of the garden including the length of the rectangular plot: B + 2 + L + 2 = B + L + 4 ...eq. 3
  As the garden is 1 metre broad, the length of the rectangular plot after adding 1-metre garden on either side will be L + 2.
  Similarly, the breadth of the rectangular plot after adding 1-metre garden on either side will be B + 2.
  Therefore, total width of the garden will be L + 2 + B + 2 = L + B + 4
  Total length of the garden will be B + 2 + L + 2 = B + L + 4
  Area of the garden can be calculated by multiplying the length and the breadth of the garden (i.e. area of (L + B + 4) x (B + L + 4))
  Therefore, cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around rectangular plot will be (L+B+4)*(B+L+4) * 10
  Simplifying that, we get 10(L²+ LB + BL + B² + 8L + 8B + 16) = 10(L+B)² + 160

  Let the breadth and length of the rectangular plot be b and l respectively.
  Perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(l+b) = 340 m.
  Thus, l+b = 170m.
  We have to calculate the area of the 1-metre boundary. Since it's a rectangular boundary, it has constant width of 1 metre on all the sides of the rectangular plot.
  We have to subtract the area of the plot from the area of bigger rectangle formed by adding 1-metre boundary to all sides of the rectangular plot to get the area of the 1-metre boundary alone.
  Hence, area of the plot is l*b sq.m
  And, area of the added boundary is (l+2)*(b+2) sq.m 
  Thus, area of the 1-metre boundary is (l+2)*(b+2) - l*b sq.m
  Cost of gardening is 10 per sq.m.

  We have a rectangular plot with a perimeter of 340 metres.
  Perimeter = 2 * (length + width)
  Given, perimeter = 340 
  So, 2 * (length + width) = 340 
  length + width = 170                 

  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around this rectangular plot
  The breadth of this boundary will be one meter on all four sides of rectangular plot.
  The area of this 1-meter broad boundary will be equal to the area of two rectangles which can be formed by adding two of its sides a metre wide each.
  Area of the 1-meter broad boundary = 2 * (length + 1) * (width + 1) sq. meters

  The cost of gardening per square meter is given as 10.
  Therefore, cost of gardening 1 square meter will be 10.

  Now, to calculate the cost of gardening the entire area, we need to calculate the area of 1-meter – broad boundary around this rectangular plot.
  Area of 1-meter broad boundary = 2 * (length + 1) * (width + 1) square meters
  Total cost of gardening 1-meter-broad boundary area = 10 * Area of 1-metre broad boundary.

  Thus, we can determine the cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 meters at the rate of 10 per square metre.

Calculation:
  As we have calculated earlier, length + width = 170
  Let's assume, length = 85 meters and width = 85 meters as we know that length and width would be equal for a rectangular plot to have the maximum area. Then,
  Area of the rectangular plot = length * width = 85 * 85 = 7225 sq. meters
  Area of 1-meter broad boundary = 2 * (length + 1) * (width + 1) = 2 * (85 + 1) * (85 + 1) = 2 * 86 * 86
                                = 14824 sq. meters
  Cost of gardening 1 sq. meter is 10.
  Therefore, cost of gardening 1-meter broad boundary around the rectangular plot = 14824 * 10 = 148240

Therefore, the cost of gardening 1-metre broad boundary around a rectangular plot having a perimeter of 340 meters at the rate of 10 per square metre is 148240.

  L+B = 170
  A 1-meter wide boundary along the plot would add 1 meter to both the length and the breadth of the plot.
  New perimeter = 2(L+2+B+2) = 2(L+B+4) = 2(170+4) = 348
  Hence, the length and breadth of the rectangular plot including boundary would be L+2 and B+2, respectively.
  Area of the rectangular plot including the boundary = (L+2) * (B+2)
  Cost of gardening = 10 per square metre
  Cost of gardening 1-metre-broad boundary = 10*4=40 per metre
  Total cost of gardening = cost of gardening area of rectangular plot including the boundary + cost of gardening around the boundary
  Total cost of gardening = (L+2) * (B+2) * 10 + 40*348
  Total cost of gardening = (L+2) * (B+2) * 10 + 13920
  We know that L+B=170, we can write the area of the rectangular plot as L * B. Therefore, the length and breadth of the rectangular plot including boundary would be (L+2) and (B+2), respectively.
  The problem can be solved now.
  Let's substitute L = (170-B)
  Total cost of gardening = [(170-B)+2] * (B+2) * 10 + 13920
  Total cost of gardening = (172-B) * (B+2) * 10 + 13920
  Simplifying the above formula will give us the cost of gardening the rectangular plot.
  Total cost of gardening = 10B^2 - 60B + 15160

  We can find out B and L using  L+B = 170. This gives us B = 85 => L = 85
  Substituting B = 85 in the above formula we get a cost of gardening the rectangular plot including boundary of:
  Total cost of gardening = 10*85^2 - 60 * 85 + 15160 = 7240
  Adding the cost of gardening 1-metre-broad boundary we get:

  We know that the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of all four sides. 
  If we let the length of the rectangle be 'l' and the width be 'w', then we can express this problem in terms of a formula:
  P = 2(l + w)
  We are given P = 340 metres. So,
  340 = 2(l + w)
  170 = l + w
  We are also given that the cost is 10 per square metre. 
  We need to find the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary along with the outer boundary of the rectangular plot.
  The width of the boundary is 1 metre, so we need to add 1 metre to both length and width of the rectangular plot to express this problem in terms of square metres to find the cost. 
  Let's calculate the cost:
  Area of the rectangular plot = lw
  Area of the rectangular plot along with the boundary = (l+2)(w+2) = lw + 2l + 2w + 4
  Area of only the boundary = Area of the rectangular plot along with the boundary - Area of the rectangular plot
  Area of only the boundary = lw + 2l + 2w + 4 - lw 
  Area of only the boundary = 2l + 2w + 4
  Cost of 1 square metre = 10
  Cost of gardening the boundary = Area of only the boundary x cost of 1 square metre
  Cost of gardening the boundary = (2l + 2w + 4) x 10
  Cost of gardening the boundary = 20l + 20w + 40
  Now, let's plug l + w = 170 into the equation:
  Cost of gardening the boundary = 20l + 20w + 40
  Cost of gardening the boundary = 20(170 - w) + 20w + 40
  Cost of gardening the boundary = 3400 - 20w + 20w + 40
  Cost of gardening the boundary = 3440

  J + F = 2*(S) (Equation 2)

To solve the problem we can substitute equation 2 and 3 in equation 1 and solve for F. 

Working:

  Substituting equation 2 in equation 1:

  Substituting equation 3 in equation 1:
  J + S + 2*(S - (J-F)) = 100   (Equation 5)

  F = J - S + 50           (Equation 6)

  Substituting Equation 6 in Equation 7 yields:
  4*S - J + J - S + 50 = 200
  3*S = 150
  S = 50

  Substituting S = 50 in Equation 4,
  100 - F - J = 100
  F + J = 0
  F = -J

  Substituting S = 50 in Equation 2,
  J + F = 2*S
  J - J = 2*50
  J = 50

- Let J = Joe's current age
- Let S = Joe's sister's current age
- Let F = Joe's father's current age
- We can write two equations from the given information:
1) J + S + F = 100 (since their ages sum up to 100)
2) When J = F, S + (F - S) * 2 (since Joe's sister will be twice her current age when Joe is as old as his father)
3) J + (F - S) = 2 * (S - (F - S)) (since Joe's father will be twice as old as his sister was when her father was as old as Joe is now)
- We can solve this system of equations to find F:
1) F = 100 - J - S
2) J = F -> S + (F - S) * 2
3) J + F - S = 2 * S - 2 * F + 2 * S
   -> 2 * F = 3 * S - J

- Substituting the first equation into the second equation:
   J + (100 - J - S - S) = 2S - 2(100 - J - S)
   -> J + S - 100 = -2J + 3S - 200
   -> 3J - 2S = 100

- Substituting 3J - 2S = 100 into 2F = 3S - J:
   2F = 3S - J
   -> 2F = 3S - (3J - 2S)
   -> 2F = 5S - 3J
   -> 2F = 5S - 3(100 - S - J)
   -> 5F = 9S - 300

- Solving for F:
   5F = 9S - 300
   5F = 9(100 - J - F) - 300 (from equation 1)
   -> 5F = 900 - 9J - 9F - 300
   -> 14F = 600 - 9J
   -> F = (600 - 9J) / 14

- Since F is an integer, 9J must be a multiple of 14.
  Therefore, J can be 14, 28, 42, 56, 70, or 84.

- Checking each possibility:
  If J = 14, then F = 45
  If J = 28, then F = 48
  If J = 42, then F = 51 (not an option)
  If J = 56, then F = 61 (not an option)

  Let's assume Joe's age is x, his sister's age is y and their father's age is z.
  From the given information, we can have the following two equations:
  x + y + z = 100
  x + (t-z) = t        <=>  x = t-z-(1)
  y + (t-z) = 2 * y    <=>  y = t-z-(2)

There are three variables; the ages of Joe, his sister, and their father.
Statement 1 gives us that Joe's age + his sister's age + their father's age is equal to 100.
Statement 2 gives us a relationship between the age of Joe's sister and the age of Joe and their father.
Statement 3 gives us a relationship between the three variables.

Equation 1: Joe + Sister + Father = 100
Equation 2: Sister + (Father - Joe) = 2*(Sister) [Substitute Joe + Father for Sister + Father in the equation]
Equation 3: Father = 2*(Sister - (Father - Sister)) [Substitute Joe + Father for Sister + Father in the equation]

Action: 
Let's solve the equations to find the value of Father's age.
Starting with equation 1:
Joe + Sister + Father = 100
Joe = 100 - Sister - Father

Substitute Joe in Equation 2:
Sister + (Father - (100 - Sister - Father)) = 2*Sister
Sister + Father - 100 + Sister + Father = 2*Sister
2*Father - 100 = Sister

Substitute Sister in Equation 3:
Father = 2*(2*Father - 100 - Father + 2*Father - 100)
Father = 2*(3*Father - 200)
Father = 3*Father - 200
Now, we can solve for Father:
2*Father = 200
Father = 100

Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 100.

  Let's assume the age of Joe is J, his sister is S and his father is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100 from the first statement.
  When Joe is as old as his father i.e. J + F, his sister will be two times her present age i.e. 2S.
  Therefore, S + (J + F) = 2S. Simplify the equation to obtain J + F = S.
  Using the second statement, we can form another equation. When Joe is as old as his dad, F is twice the age when his sister was as old as dad. 
  When his sister was as old as his father, her age was (F - S). Therefore, F = 2 * (F - S).
  Simplifying this equation, we get S = F/3.
  We now have three equations J + S + F = 100, J + F = S and S = F/3.
  We can solve for S and F in terms of J. Then substitute in the first equation to get the value for J. Finally, substitute found value of J into any of the three equations to get the value of F.
  The age of Joe's father is F. 

Calculations: 
  From S = F/3 and J + F = S, we get J + F = F/3. Solving for J in terms of F, we get J = 2F/3.
  Substituting S and J in the equation J + S + F = 100, we get 2F/3 + F/3 + F = 100.
  Simplifying, we get F = 45.

Let's suppose the distance between A and B is x.
Let's also draw a timeline from when Kevin starts driving from A to when he returns to A after reaching B. At time t = 0, Kevin starts driving from A to B. At time t=t1, Kevin reaches B and starts driving back to A.
Let's calculate t1 first.
The time taken to reach B is given by:
time = distance / speed.
Therefore, time taken by Kevin to reach B at a speed of 70 mph = x/70.
The time taken for Kevin to get back to A is given by:
time = distance / speed.
Therefore, time taken by Kevin to get back to A at a speed of 90 mph = x/90.
The total time for Kevin's trip is given by:
time_trip = time_to_reach_B + time_to_reach_A
time_trip = x/70 + x/90 = 8x/630 hours.
Now, we know that Kevin was 70 miles away from B exactly 3 hours before the trip ended. This means he had already traveled the distance x - 70 from A when he was 3 hours away from finishing the trip.
Let's calculate the time Kevin had left to cover the remaining distance (70 miles + the distance from A to Kevin's current location) in the last 3 hours of the trip.
Since Kevin will cover x - 70 miles in (time_trip - 3) hours, we can write:
(x - 70)/(time_trip - 3) = 90
This is because Kevin drives at a speed of 90 mph in the last three hours of the trip.
We can simplify this equation by using time_trip = 8x/630.
After substituting, we get:
(x - 70)/(8x/630 - 3) = 90
After simplifying the above equation further, we get:
x^2 - 36450x + 5895000 = 0
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula to get two possible values of x:
x = 270, 21850/3 (rounded to the nearest integer)

  Solving the two equations, we get t1 = 4.2 and t2 = 2.8.

  Let d be the distance between A and B. 
  Let t1 and t2 be the time taken to travel from A to B and from B to A respectively. Let T be the total time taken for the round trip. 
  We know that d/70 + d/90 = T
  Also, T - t1 - 3 = t2 

  We need to find the value of d.

  Let's find an equation for T. 
  
  d/70 + d/90 = T
  
  Taking the LCM and simplifying the equation, we get
  
  T = (9d + 7d)/630 = 16d/630 = 8d/315
  
  Using the equation for T, let's find an expression for t2 in terms of d and t1.

  T - t1 - 3 = t2 
  
  8d/315 - t1 - 3 = t2
  
  We know that when t2 = t1 + 3, Kevin is exactly 70 miles away from B.

  d - 70 = 70t1 - 90(t1 + 3)
  d - 70 = -20t1 - 270
  
  Rearranging the above equation, we get
  
  d = 20t1 - 200 = 20(t1 - 10)
  
  We substitute this value of d in the equation T = 8d/315 to get an equation for T in terms of t1.
  
  T = 8(20(t1 - 10))/315
  T = 32(t1 - 10)/315
  
  We know that the total time taken for the round trip is t1 + t2 and we can express t2 in terms of t1 using the equation T - t1 - 3 = t2. 

  We get t1 + t2 = t1 + T - t1 - 3 = T - 3 = 32(t1 - 10)/315 - 3
 
  We see that to solve for d we only need t1. We can solve this equation for t1 using the equation above and setting t2 to t1 + 3.

  8d/315 - t1 - 3 = t1 + 3 -t1
  
  8d/315 - 6 = 3 

  Solving the above equation we get t1 = 57/7
  Therefore, d = 20(t1 - 10) = 180

- Kevin drove from A to B, and then returned back to A with the different rates.
- Let's suppose the distance between A and B is ""d"".
- His speed was 70 miles per hour from A to B and 90 miles per hour from B to A. 
- Let's suppose the time it took him from A to B is ""t"" hours.
- Then, the time it took him from B to A will also be ""t"" hours.
- When he started from A, the time it took him from 70th mile to B will be (d-70)/70.
- Then, he returned 70 miles back, so he will be (d-70-70)=d-140 miles away from B.
- So, the remaining distance will be 140 miles when he is driving back to A.
- Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip means that he has total (t+t-3)=2t-3 hours to return back from 140 miles away from A.
- We can use the speed, time and distance formula to calculate d.
- First, we can calculate the time it took Kevin to drive to B. 
- The formula for speed is distance (d) divided by time (t). So, 70 = d/t. We can rearrange to get t = d/70.
- Since it took him t hours to drive to B, and the time taken on the way back is also t hours, Kevin's total driving time is 2t hours.
- 3 hours before the end of his trip, Kevin has a remaining driving time of (2t - 3) hours to cover 140 miles from near B back to A at 90 mph.
 - We can use the speed, time and distance formula again, but we have two unknowns: d and t. We need to eliminate t to solve for d. 
 - We know that the time it took Kevin to drive from A to B is d/70, so the time he has to return from near B to A is (2t-3) - d/70.
 - We can use these two expressions for time as equal to each other and solve for d.
 - (d-70)/70 + (d-140)/90 = (2t-3) - d/70
 - Simplifying and solving the equation for d gives us d = 270.

  Let d = the distance between A and B.
  Let t1 = the time it took Kevin to travel from A to B.
  Let t2 = the time it took Kevin to travel from B to A.
  Let t3 = the time that passed before Kevin was 70 miles away from B.
  We know rate × time = distance.
  Since Kevin traveled at a constant speed of 70 mph from A to B, we have d = 70t1.
  Since Kevin traveled at a constant speed of 90 mph from B to A, we have d = 90t2.
  From t3, we know that he still had 70 miles to go from B to A, so d - 70 = 90(t2-t1) 
  We also know that 3 hours from the end of his trip, his distance from A was:
  70 + 90(t2 - t3) = 90(t1 - t3)
  We have two equations and two variables, we can solve for d:
  d = 70t1 = 90t2
  d - 70 = 90(t2 - t1) = 90t2 - 90t1 
  d - 90(t1 - t3) = 70 + 90(t2 - t3)
  We can substitute the first equation into the last equation:
  70t1 - 90(t1 - t3) = 70 + 90(t2 - t3)
  160t3 = 20t1 + 70
  t3 = (1/16)20t1 + (1/16)70 = (5/4)t1 + (7/8)
  We can substitute the value of t3 back into the second equation to solve for d:
  d - 70 = 90t2 - 90t1 
  d - 90t1 + 90[(5/4)t1 + (7/8)] = 70 + 90t1
  d = 180t1 - 140
  We can substitute the value of d back into the second equation to solve for t2:
  d = 90t2
  180t1 - 140 = 90t2
  t2 = (2t1)/3 - (14/18) = (2t1)/3 - (7/9)
  We can substitute the value of t2 into the first equation to solve for t1:
  d = 70t1
  180t1 - 140 = 70t1(2/3) 
  540t1 - 420 = 140t1 
  t1 = 15/4

To find out how much each daughter receives, we need to find out the total amount of money that is going to daughters and nephews, and then divide it among the daughters such that each of them receives four times the amount that each nephew receives.

Let x be the amount each nephew receives

 - Amount that each daughter receives => 4x
 - Amount that each son receives => 5x
 
Total people = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

Total amount of money = Rs 8,600

Total amount of money given to 4 daughters and 2 nephews = 4(4x) + 2(x) = 18x

Remaining amount of money = 8600 - 18x

This remaining amount is distributed among 5 sons

Each son gets 5x, therefore,
5 * 5x = 25x is the total amount given to sons.

Total amount of money distributed = 18x + 25x = 43x
We know that 43x = 8600 (Total amount of money given)

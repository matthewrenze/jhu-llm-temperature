  The original solution has a concentration of 10/100 = 0.1 g/ml.
  To make a solution that is half as concentrated, we need to dilute the original solution by a factor of 2.
  To dilute the solution by a factor of 2, we need to add an equal volume of water to the original solution.
  Therefore, David should add 100 ml of water to the original solution to obtain a solution that is about half as concentrated.

  The question is asking about the best way to ensure that the paper sailboats will float without tipping over in the water.
  Option A, constructing a prototype of a boat for testing, is a good way to test the design and make sure it floats.
  Option B, calculating the total mass of all of the finished boats, does not ensure that the boats will float without tipping over.
  Option C, determining the total amount of weight each boat can carry, is a good way to test the capacity of the boats but does not ensure that they will float without tipping over.
  Option D, testing the strength of each material used to construct the boats, is not relevant to the question.
  Therefore, the best way for the students to be sure the paper sailboats will float without tipping over in the water is to construct a prototype of a boat for testing.

  Artificial reefs provide a substrate for the attachment of marine organisms.
  The most important way an artificial reef may support the development of a complex ecosystem is by providing habitat for small invertebrates and algae.
  Small invertebrates and algae are the base of the food chain in the ocean.
  Therefore, the answer is B: by providing habitat for algae and small invertebrates.

  The water cycle in a terrarium is important for the survival of the plants and animals.
  Terrariums can be self-sustaining, but it is difficult to create a terrarium ecosystem that will last a long time without human help.
  The answer is not A or B because terrariums can get enough sunlight and oxygen.
  The answer is not C because ecosystems with few species can be stable.

  An aquifer is an underground layer of water-bearing rock.
  Water from an aquifer is usually filtered by rock and soil deep within Earth.
  This filtration process removes pollutants and impurities from the water.
  Therefore, water from an aquifer is more likely to be cleaner than water from other sources.

  The stopping distance of an object depends on its momentum and the force applied to it.
  Momentum is the product of mass and velocity.
  The ship carrying heavier cargo has more mass than the ship carrying lighter cargo.
  Both ships are traveling at the same speed, so they have the same velocity.
  Therefore, the ship carrying heavier cargo has greater momentum than the ship carrying lighter cargo.
  Greater momentum means that more force is required to stop the ship.
  Therefore, the ship carrying heavy cargo takes more time to come to a stop than an identical ship carrying lighter cargo.
  The answer is B: greater momentum.

  The human body has several mechanisms to protect itself against infection and disease.
  The first line of defense is usually a physical barrier that prevents pathogens from entering the body.
  The skin is the largest organ of the human body and acts as a physical barrier against pathogens.
  Vitamins are essential nutrients that help the body function properly, but they are not the first line of defense against infection and disease.
  Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to the body's tissues and are not directly involved in the immune response.

  Intrusive igneous rocks are formed from magma that cools slowly beneath the Earth's surface.
  Clastic sedimentary rocks are formed from the accumulation of sediments.
  Metamorphic rocks are formed from the transformation of existing rocks.
  Volcanic rocks are formed from the solidified lava or other volcanic materials.
  The rock was formed from lava that cooled quickly on the Earth's surface, so it is an extrusive igneous rock.

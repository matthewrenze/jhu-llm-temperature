  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m.
  The cost of 1 meter of the paper is Rs.2.

  The first and third letters must be different from each other and are both consonants, so there are 20 choices for the first letter and 19 choices for the third letter.
  The order of the first and third letters matters, so we need to multiply by 2.
  Therefore, the total number of different codes that can be made is 5 x 20 x 19 x 2 = 3,800.

  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees.
  Therefore, 100 - 75 - 20 = 5% of the employees take only a summer vacation.
  40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation.
  Therefore, 40 - 5 = 35% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  We can start by trying the answer choices:
  - If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 80 = 260 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 260. By solving this equation, we get x = 3 and y = 8. This means that she brought 4 copper coins, which is not the minimum number.
  - If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 60 = 280 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 280. By solving this equation, we get x = 2 and y = 10. This means that she brought 3 copper coins, which is the minimum number.

  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that stronger evidence is needed or the perpetrator admits responsibility to justify imposing the penalty.

  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks is not as strong as the argument suggests.
  Answer choice A does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice B suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which weakens the argument.

The method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, and the method obscures the fact that the brain functions are distributed. The author argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid, and the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.

It explains that the modular theory of mind may not be valid and that the subtractive method used in brain scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. The passage also explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use. Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is:

  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to the relationships between other things.
  Option B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.

  Parsons believes that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent.
  He thinks that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  Parsons believes that governments never lead; they follow progress.
  He thinks that progress moves on a step when the voice of the protesting minority can no longer be silenced by the prison, stake, or scaffold.
  Parsons believes that political parties, when in power, are after all but human with all the human attributes of the politician.
  He thinks that it is necessary for political parties to build up a powerful machine to crush all opposition and silence all vigorous murmurs of discontent.
  Parsons believes that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the management of all its affairs to be managed by the party which happened to come into power.
  He thinks that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  Parsons turned from a political Socialist to the non-political phase of Socialism—Anarchism—because he believes that in its philosophy he can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

  The studies found that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

  We can start by cross-multiplying the equation to get rid of the fractions.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except when the denominator $x-3$ is equal to zero.
  Therefore, $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
  We can simplify the equation to get:
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2(x-3)(x)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2(x-3)(x-x+3)=0$$
  $$2(x-3)(3)=0$$
  $$x-3=0 \text{ or } x=3$$
  $$x=3$$

- We are looking for the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y.
- We can find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can then find the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can then divide the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream to find the probability.

Action: Answer(""A"") 

We can find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams: 

Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream = 28 + 57 + 11 + 68 = 164

We can find the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams:

Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream = 11 + 68 = 79

Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

Probability = Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream / Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream
Probability = 79 / 164

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

Probability = 0.4817

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:

Probability = 0.48

- We are looking for the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y.
- We can find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can then find the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can then divide the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream to find the probability.

Action: Answer(""A"") 

We can find the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams: 

Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream = 28 + 57 + 11 + 68 = 164

We can find the number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams:

Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream = 11 + 68 = 79

Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

Probability = Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream / Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream
Probability = 79 / 164

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

Probability = 0.4817

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:

Probability = 0.48

Therefore, the answer is A: $\frac{68}{100}$.

  Functional class III, Class I type I, Class II div I, and Class II div II are different types of malocclusion.
  Malocclusion is a misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches when they approach each other as the jaws close.
  Familial inheritance is the passing of traits from parents to offspring.
  Strong familial inheritance means that the trait is more likely to be passed down from parents to offspring.
  Therefore, I need to find out which type of malocclusion has a strong familial inheritance.

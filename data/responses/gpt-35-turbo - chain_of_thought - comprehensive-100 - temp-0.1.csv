Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.
Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x.
The area of the four walls is 2x(5y - 2x).
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
The area of the four walls to be papered is (2x(5y - 2x) - 15).
The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
The cost of papering the walls is (2x(5y - 2x) - 15) * 0.5 * 2 = (2x(5y - 2x) - 15).
Therefore, (2x(5y - 2x) - 15) = 260/2 = 130.

  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation as follows:
    a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a2 - b2)/((a + b)(a + b))
                      = [(a + b)(a - b)]/[(a + b)(a + b)]
                      = (a - b)/(a + b)
  Therefore, we need to find a value that is equal to (a - b)/(a + b)
  We can see that (a - b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  Rearranging this equation, we get:
    a2 - b2 = (a - b)2 + 2ab
  Dividing both sides by (a + b)2, we get:
    (a2 - b2)/((a + b)2) = (a - b)2/((a + b)2) + 2ab/((a + b)2)
                         = (a - b)/(a + b) + 2ab/((a + b)(a + b))
  We can simplify the right-hand side of the equation as follows:
    (a - b)/(a + b) + 2ab/((a + b)(a + b)) = (a - b)/(a + b) + 2ab/(a2 + 2ab + b2)
                                           = (a - b)/(a + b) + 2ab/(a + b)2
                                           = (a2 - b2 + 2ab)/(a + b)2
                                           = (a + b)2/(a + b)2
                                           = 1
  Therefore, the answer is C: (a + b)2.

  Let's call the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation ""Q"".
  We know that:
  - 75 employees take a winter vacation
  - 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations
  - 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations
  - Let's assume that x employees take only a winter vacation (and not a summer vacation).
  - Let's assume that y employees take only a summer vacation (and not a winter vacation).
  - Let's assume that z employees take both winter and summer vacations.
  We can use this information to create an equation:
  x + y + z + 20 = 100 (total number of employees)
  We also know that:
  - 75% of employees take a winter vacation, which means 25% of employees do not take a winter vacation.
  - Let's assume that w percent of employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  We can use this information to create another equation:
  w + z = Q (percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation)
  We can use the information we have to solve for Q.
  First, we can solve for x:
  x + y + z + 20 = 100
  x + y + z = 80
  We know that 40% of employees take both winter and summer vacations, which means:
  z = 40
  We can substitute this into the equation:
  x + y + 40 = 80
  x + y = 40
  We know that 75% of employees take a winter vacation, which means:
  x + z = 75
  We can substitute z = 40 into the equation:
  x + 40 = 75
  x = 35
  Now we know that 35 employees take only a winter vacation.
  We can use this information to find y:
  x + y + z = 80
  35 + y + 40 = 80
  y = 5
  Now we know that 5 employees take only a summer vacation (and not a winter vacation).
  Finally, we can solve for Q:
  w + z = Q
  w + 40 = Q
  We know that 60% of employees take a summer vacation (either alone or with a winter vacation), which means:
  w + y + z = 60
  w + 5 + 40 = 60
  w = 15
  Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 15%.

  Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve for x in terms of y: 20x = 340 - 25y => x = (340 - 25y)/20.
  Since x has to be a positive integer, we can try different values of y until we get a positive integer value for x.
  If we try y = 0, we get x = 17, which is a positive integer.
  If we try y = 1, we get x = 14.75, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 2, we get x = 12.5, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 3, we get x = 10.25, which is not a positive integer.
  If we try y = 4, we get x = 8, which is a positive integer.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 8.

  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  We can start by trying the answer choices:
  - If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 80 = 260 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 260. By solving this equation, we get x = 3 and y = 8. This means that she brought 4 copper coins, which is not the minimum number.
  - If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents. The remaining amount of money she got from brass coins is 340 - 60 = 280 cents. We can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 280. By solving this equation, we get x = 2 and y = 10. This means that she brought 3 copper coins, which is the minimum number.

  If she brought 4 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*4 = 80 cents.
  We can substitute x = 4 in the equation 20x + 25y = 340 and solve for y.
  20*4 + 25y = 340
  80 + 25y = 340
  25y = 260
  y = 10.4
  The value of y should be an integer, but we got a decimal value, which means that x = 4 is not the correct answer.
  We can try the next answer choice.
  If she brought 3 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*3 = 60 cents.
  We can substitute x = 3 in the equation 20x + 25y = 340 and solve for y.

  The value of y should be an integer, but we got a decimal value, which means that x = 3 is not the correct answer.
  We can try the next answer choice.
  If she brought 2 copper coins, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*2 = 40 cents.
  We can substitute x = 2 in the equation 20x + 25y = 340 and solve for y.
  20*2 + 25y = 340
  40 + 25y = 340
  25y = 300
  y = 12
  The value of y is an integer, which means that x = 2 is a possible answer.
  We need to check if there is another answer choice that gives a smaller value of x.
  If she brought 1 copper coin, then the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20*1 = 20 cents.
  We can substitute x = 1 in the equation 20x + 25y = 340 and solve for y.
  20*1 + 25y = 340

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A does not shake the traditional view, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the traditional view.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names. This statement challenges the traditional view and provides a new perspective.
  Statement C mentions different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Statement D provides an example of how a hexagram name was created, but it does not challenge the traditional view.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

Option A suggests that when the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed. This statement does not weaken Li Ming's argument.
Option B suggests that even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve. This statement does not weaken Li Ming's argument.

  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks is not as straightforward as the argument suggests.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice C weakens the argument because it suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This implies that watching television is not the only factor that influences people's perception of risk.
  Answer choice D weakens the argument because it suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. This implies that watching television is not the only way that people can become informed about risks.

The author argues that this premise may not be valid because mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. 
Action: Answer(""D"") 
The author of the passage would be most likely to agree with the statement that the subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

Option A is not supported by the passage as it states that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, which is contrary to the argument made by William Uttal. 
Option B is not supported by the passage as it states that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero, which is not mentioned in the passage. 
Option C is supported by the passage as it explains that the FMRI measures the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity, and that the differential rate of oxygen use is what is depicted in the brain scan. 
Option D is not supported by the passage as it does not mention that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.

  The passages discuss the authors' views on equality and the proper role of men and women in society.
  Tocqueville believes that men and women have different roles to play in society based on their physical and moral differences.
  He argues that the Americans have applied the principle of political economy to the sexes by dividing their duties so that each can fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Mill believes that every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them.
  He argues that to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.

  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A, $x = 0$ and $y = 7$. Substituting into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$, which is not true.

- We are looking for the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y.
- We can calculate this probability by dividing the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream in Group Y by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream.
- The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- We can find the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream in Group Y by adding the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y.
- Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{\text{number of people who recalled at least 1 dream in Group Y}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{\text{number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams + number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y}}{\text{number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams + number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group X + number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams + number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y}}$.
- We can find the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y by looking at the table.
- The number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group Y is 11, and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y is 68.
- The total number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams is the sum of the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group X and the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group Y.
- The total number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams is the sum of the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group X and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y.
- We can find the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group X by subtracting the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group Y from the total number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams.
- The total number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams is 39, and the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group Y is 11, so the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams in Group X is 28.
- We can find the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group X by subtracting the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y from the total number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams.
- The total number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams is 125, and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group Y is 68, so the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams in Group X is 57.
- Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{11+68}{28+57+11+68} = \frac{79}{164}$.

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then the length of the room is 5x - 4x = x.
  The area of the four walls is 2x * (x + 5x) = 12x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is 12x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of the paper required is (12x^2 - 15) * 2 / 100.
  So, (12x^2 - 15) * 2 / 100 = 260 / 2 = 130.
  Solving this equation, we get x = 2.6.

  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The total area to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost is Rs.2 per meter.

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The cost of papering the walls is equal to the cost of the paper used.
  The cost of the paper used is equal to the area of the walls multiplied by the cost per meter.
  The area of the walls is equal to the height of the room multiplied by the semi-perimeter multiplied by the width of the paper.
  We need to subtract the area of the doors and windows from the total area of the walls.
  We can then solve for x and find the height of the room.
  After solving, we get x = 2.6.

  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, so we can set up the equation 2(50/100)(9x^2 - 15) = 260.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x and the breadth of the room is y.
  The area of the four walls of the room is (2x)(5y - 2x) = 10xy - 4x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is the area of the paper required.
  The area of the paper required is (10xy - 4x^2 - 15) sq.m.
  The length of the paper required is the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room.
  The perimeter of the room is 2(5y - 2x) + 2y = 10y - 4x + 2y = 12y - 4x.
  The length of the paper required is (12y - 4x)(2x) = 24xy - 8x^2.
  The cost of the paper is Rs.260.
  The cost of the paper required is (24xy - 8x^2)(2)/100 = (48xy - 16x^2)/100.
  Therefore, we have the equation (48xy - 16x^2)/100 = 260.

  The area of the four walls after subtracting the area of doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 1m is Rs.8.
  So, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall with paper of width 1m is Rs.8 = (2)(4).

  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is 2x(5y - 2x) - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50 cm = 0.5 m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.

  So, we can write the equation 20x + 25y = 340.

  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since there are only 7 weeks, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth or fifth week.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  If F and J are scheduled for the first two weeks, then K must be scheduled for the third week, which means that G cannot be scheduled for the third week. This contradicts condition (1).
  Therefore, F and J must be scheduled for the second and third weeks, in some order.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be scheduled before J and S. Since S is scheduled for the sixth week, K must be scheduled for the fourth or fifth week.
  If K is scheduled for the fifth week, then O must be scheduled for the first week and R must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  If K is scheduled for the fourth week, then O must be scheduled for the fifth week and R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, if S is scheduled for the sixth week, then R must be scheduled for the fourth week.

To weaken Li Ming's argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that people who are unemployed will have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
Option A suggests that after the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.

  Statement C is impossible because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  Statement D is possible because Trustcorp can own the Flores Tower and the Yates House if they trade for them.

  The Yates House is class 3, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings.

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings

  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the statements above.
  Option A is incorrect because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  Option B is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about every print sold in the museum store being a copy of a twentieth-century work.
  Option C is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
  Option D is incorrect because the statements do not provide information about Hopper's Nighthawks being on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  The only option left is E, which states that Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. This is true because the statements do not provide information about Hopper's Nighthawks being part of the museum's permanent collection or on loan from a private collector.

  Choice D describes a situation where the foundation decides not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior. It is not clear whether the research proposal shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life, so it is not clear whether it is justified by the principle stated by the university president.
  Choice E describes a situation where the research is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease, which is a practical problem that affects people's quality of life. Therefore, it is most justified by the principle stated by the university president.
  The answer is E: A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology research.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology research depends on.
  The modular theory of mind holds that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  However, the passage argues that this theory may not be valid and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  The passage also explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  The FMRI depicts the differential rate of oxygen use: one first takes a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work.

  The passage describes how Eppie's presence has a positive impact on Silas.
  Eppie is described as a creature of endless claims and ever-growing desires, seeking and loving sunshine, and living sounds, and living movements.
  Silas is described as a person who was deafened and blinded more and more to all things except the monotony of his loom and the repetition of his web.
  Eppie's presence awakens Silas's senses with her fresh life, even to the old winter-flies that came crawling forth in the early spring sunshine, and warming him into joy because she had joy.
  Silas began to look for the once familiar herbs again; and as the leaves, with their unchanged outline and markings, lay on his palm, there was a sense of crowding remembrances from which he turned away timidly, taking refuge in Eppie's little world, that lay lightly on his enfeebled spirit.

  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.

  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is satisfied.

  The line passes through the origin, which means the $y$-intercept is 0.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$, which means that for every 1 unit increase in $x$, the $y$-coordinate increases by $\frac{1}{7}$.
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a line, $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept, to find the equation of the line.
  Since the $y$-intercept is 0, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  We can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line to see which point lies on the line.
  Only point A satisfies the equation of the line.

  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A, $x = 0$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$, which is not true.
  For point B, $x = 1$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$, which is not true.
  For point C, $x = 7$ and $y = 7$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$, which is true.
  For point D, $x = 14$ and $y = 2$. Substituting these values into the equation of the line, we get $2 = \frac{1}{7}(14)$, which is true.

  The text is discussing how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The first step is to make sure the expectations are age-appropriate.
  The second sentence talks about developmental milestones that provide a guideline for what a child might be expected to do.
  The third sentence mentions that children develop at their own pace, so there is no guarantee that a child isn't a little ahead or behind the guideline.
  The most likely completion to the text is an explanation of how to adjust expectations based on the child's developmental stage.
  Choice A talks about adjusting expectations, but it doesn't mention developmental stages.
  Choice B talks about telling the child about their past behavior, but it doesn't explain how to adjust expectations.
  Choice C talks about researching developmental milestones, which is mentioned in the text, but it doesn't explain how to adjust expectations.

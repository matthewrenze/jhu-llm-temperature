  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (5x/2 * 2x) + (5x/2 * 2x) + (9x/2 * 2x) + (9x/2 * 2x) = 29x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The total area to be papered is 29x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost is Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the cost of papering per sq.m is Rs.2/0.5 = Rs.4.
  So, we can write an equation: (29x^2 - 15) * 4 = 260.
  Solving the equation, we get x^2 = 3.
  Therefore, x = sqrt(3).
  Hence, the height of the room is 2x = 2 * sqrt(3) = 3.46m (approx).

  Let the height of the room be 2x.
  Let the semi-perimeter of the room be 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 5y - 4x.
  The area of the four walls is 2x(5y - 4x).
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is (2x(5y - 4x) - 15).
  The area of the four walls to be papered is (2x(5y - 4x) - 15) * 2.
  The cost of papering the four walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering the four walls is (50/100) * (2x(5y - 4x) - 15) * 2 * 2.
  Equating the two expressions for the cost of papering the four walls, we get:
  (50/100) * (2x(5y - 4x) - 15) * 2 * 2 = 260
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  x(5y - 4x) = 39
  We need to find the value of 2x.
  The answer is the value of 2x that satisfies the equation above.
  We can try the answer choices to see which one satisfies the equation.
  We can start with answer choice A: 2.6m.
  If 2x = 2.6m, then x = 1.3m.
  Substituting x = 1.3m in the equation above, we get:
  1.3m(5y - 2.6m) = 39
  6.5y - 3.38 = 30
  6.5y = 33.38
  y = 5.12m
  The height of the room is 2x = 2(1.3m) = 2.6m.

Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, the length of the room is 10y - 4x.
The area of the four walls is (2x)(10y - 4x) = 20xy - 8x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
The area of the four walls is equal to the area of the doors and windows plus the area of the wallpaper.
The area of the wallpaper is (20xy - 8x^2 + 15) sq.m.
The cost of the wallpaper is Rs.260.
The cost of the wallpaper per meter is Rs.2.
The length of the wallpaper required is (20xy - 8x^2 + 15)/(0.5) meters.
The cost of the wallpaper is equal to the length of the wallpaper required times the cost per meter.
Therefore, (20xy - 8x^2 + 15)/(0.5) x 2 = 260.
Simplifying, we get 20xy - 8x^2 + 15 = 260.
Solving this quadratic equation, we get x = 3.9 or x = -1.5. Since the height of the room cannot be negative, we reject x = -1.5.
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2(3.9) = 7.8 meters.

  The area of the four walls is (2x * 3x/2) + 2x * 5x/2 = 13x^2/2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered is (13x^2/2 - 15).
  The cost of papering is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering per meter is Rs.2.
  The length of the four walls to be papered is (13x^2/2 - 15)/(0.5) = 26x^2/4 - 30.

The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
The area of the remaining walls is 9x^2 - 15.
The length of the remaining walls is (9x/2) - (2*50)/100 = 9x/2 - 1.
The cost of papering the remaining walls is (9x/2 - 1)(2) = 9x - 4.

  The perimeter of the room is 2 times the semi-perimeter which is 10x.
  The length of the room is (perimeter - width)/2 = (10x - 0.5)/2 = 5x - 0.25.
  The area of the four walls is height times the perimeter times the width of the paper.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)*(10x)*(50/100) = 10x^2 square meters.
  The cost of papering the four walls is the area of the four walls times the cost per meter of paper.
  The cost of papering the four walls is 10x^2*2 = 20x^2 rupees.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 square meters.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is the area of the walls to be papered.
  The area of the walls to be papered is 10x^2 - 15 square meters.
  The cost of papering the walls is 260 rupees.

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x.
  Semi-perimeter = (Length + Breadth + Height)/2
  Let's assume the length, breadth, and height of the room are in the ratio of a:b:c
  Then, Length = ac/2x, Breadth = bc/2x, and Semi-perimeter = (ac + bc + 2cx)/4x
  Given, height to semi-perimeter = 2:5 => 2x = (2/5)(ac + bc + 2cx)/4x => ac + bc = 9cx
  Let's assume the length, breadth, and height of the room are 9a, 9b, and 5c, respectively.
  Then, ac + bc = 9cx => 9a*5c + 9b*5c = 9cx => a + b = x
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x = 10k.
  Then, Length = 9ak/k = 9a, Breadth = 9bk/k = 9b, and Height = 10k/2 = 5k
  Total area of the four walls = 2h(l+b) = 2(10k)(9a + 9b) = 180k(a+b)
  Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m = 15000 sq.cm
  Area of four walls to be papered = (180k(a+b) - 15000) sq.cm
  Cost of papering = Rs.260
  Width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m
  Cost of papering per meter = Rs.2
  Cost of papering per sq.cm = (2/100)/50 sq.cm = 0.0004 Rs/sq.cm
  Total cost of papering = Cost of papering per sq.cm * Area of four walls to be papered
  Total cost of papering = 0.0004 * (180k(a+b) - 15000) * 10000 Rs
  Total cost of papering = 72k(a+b) - 6 Rs
  Given, Total cost of papering = Rs.260 => 72k(a+b) - 6 = 260 => 72k(a+b) = 266
  Given, a+b = x => 72kx = 266 => kx = 133/36
  Given, height of the room = 2x = 20k/3

  Letting x = b/a, we get:

  75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees.
  40% of them take a winter and a summer vacation, which is 40 employees.
  20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees.
  Let's represent the number of employees who take only a winter vacation as W, and the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation as WS.
  We can set up the following equation: W + WS + X = 100 - 20, where X is the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.
  We know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, so W + WS = 75.
  We also know that 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, so WS = 40.
  Substituting these values into the equation, we get W + 40 + X = 80.
  Therefore, W + X = 40.
  We want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which is X/100.
  To find X, we can subtract the number of employees who take both a winter and a summer vacation from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation: X = (100 - 75) - 40 = -15.
  This doesn't make sense, so we made a mistake somewhere.
  Let's check our equation: W + WS + X = 100 - 20.
  We know that W + WS = 75, so we can substitute that in: 75 + X = 80.
  Solving for X, we get X = 5.

  The traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A is not relevant to the origin of the Gua name.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names.
  Statement C acknowledges that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but none of them have shaken the traditional view.
  Statement D does not provide any evidence to shake the traditional view.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone.Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

  Li Ming argues that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  Li Ming's argument is based on the premise that unemployed people will not have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
  To weaken Li Ming's argument, we need to show that unemployed people can still have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
  Choice A talks about the company hiring more people and many people buying the goods that have been delayed. This choice does not address the issue of unemployed people having the money to buy goods other than necessities.
  Choice B talks about consumers believing that the economic situation will eventually improve. This choice does not address the issue of unemployed people having the money to buy goods other than necessities.

To weaken Li Ming's argument, we need to show that even if people are unemployed, they can still increase their consumption, which will lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Option A suggests that after the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed. This statement does not weaken Li Ming's argument because it does not address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption.
Option B suggests that even if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve. This statement does not weaken Li Ming's argument because it does not address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption.

  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp must receive a class 2 building in return. Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade away all of its class 2 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is possible if RealProp trades away all of its buildings and receives all of Trustcorp's buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This is possible if Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and trades the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's check each option:
    A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson - This option violates the constraint that not all photographers have to be assigned. Also, Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
    B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck - This option satisfies all the constraints. Frost and Heideck are assigned together, Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, and only three photographers are assigned.
    C: Gonzalez, Knutson - This option violates the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
    D: Heideck, Lai - This option violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.

  Let's try to assign the photographers to the Silva University ceremony based on the given constraints.
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. Therefore, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony. 
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  We need at least two photographers for each ceremony. Therefore, we need to assign two more photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have three photographers left: Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, we cannot assign both Lai and Mays to the Silva University ceremony.
  Based on the given constraints, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Heideck, and Knutson.

  The argument claims that Harrold Foods dominates the market because ""Hero"" is the most popular carbonated drink product and 72% of all consumers believe that it already dominates the market.
  The argument concludes that Harrold Foods need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to dominate the market.
  The argument assumes that the current market share of Harrold Foods is greater than 50%.
  The argument does not commit the error of failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition.
  The argument does not mistake a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  The argument does not treat the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true.
  The argument does not take evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true.
  The argument commits the error of mistaking a condition that is necessary for a certain result to obtain for a condition that is sufficient to guarantee that result.
  Therefore, the answer is B: mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result.

  The museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  The works displayed in the museum are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection.
  Prints of all of the museum's permanent collection works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  Therefore, the correct answer must be logically consistent with these statements.
  
A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
  This statement is true based on the information given.

D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
  This statement is not true based on the information given. Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection, and there is no information given that it is on loan to the museum from a private collector.

  Answer choice A is not analogous because vulgar humor is not necessarily disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Answer choice B is the best answer because it describes a comedian whose humor shines a light on aspects of human nature many people would prefer to ignore, which is similar to how Schoenberg's music precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  Answer choice C is not analogous because it describes a comedian whose material is composed primarily of material already made famous by other comedians, which is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Answer choice D is not analogous because it describes a comedian whose material expresses an extreme political philosophy, which is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.
  Answer choice E is not analogous because it describes a comedian whose style of humor is unfamiliar to the audience, which is not disturbing in the same way that Schoenberg's music is.

  Beecher argues that women are not inferior to men, but that their power comes from appealing to ""kindly, generous, peaceful and benevolent principles.""
  Therefore, Beecher does not make the point that women are inferior to men.
  The answer is B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.

  The passage describes Theis and Adler's research on Texas gourd plants.
  The researchers wanted to know how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles.
  They planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and made half the plants more fragrant.
  They observed the flowers and wrote down everything they saw.
  They found that double the normal number of beetles were on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
  Pollinators did not prefer the highly scented flowers, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones.
  Theis thinks the bees were repelled not by the fragrance itself, but by the abundance of beetles.
  The results showed that fragrance-enhanced flowers had less reproduction.
  Hand pollination didn't rescue the seed set, indicating that beetles damaged flowers directly.
  Therefore, the type of evidence that Theis and Adler's research primarily relied on is direct observation.

  The passage describes the research conducted by Nina Theis and Lynn Adler.
  The researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  The researchers also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees.
  They plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.
  Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles.
  The researchers observed each flower for two-minute intervals and wrote down everything they saw.
  Therefore, the research primarily relied on direct observation.

  $$2x(x-3)=2(x-3) x$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  $$0=0$$

  This gives us $2x = x-3$, which simplifies to $x=-3$.
  However, we need to check if this value satisfies the original equation.
  If we substitute $x=-3$ into the original equation, we get $\frac{-3}{-3-3}=\frac{2(-3)}{2}$, which simplifies to $\frac{1}{2}=-3$, which is not true.

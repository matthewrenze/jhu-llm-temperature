Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.
Then, we have:
2x/5y = 2/5
=> x/y = 1/5
Let the length, breadth, and height of the room be L, B, and H respectively.
Then, we have:
L + B = 5y = 5x/1
=> L + B = 5x
Also, we have:
2(L + B) + H = 5y + 2x
=> 2(L + B) + H = 5x + 2x
=> 2(L + B) + H = 7x
Area of four walls = 2H(L + B)
Cost of papering = Rs.260
Width of paper = 50cm = 0.5m
Cost of paper per meter = Rs.2
Area covered by one meter of paper = 1m x 0.5m = 0.5 sq.m
Area covered by Rs.2 worth of paper = 1 sq.m
Area covered by Rs.260 worth of paper = 130 sq.m
Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
Area of four walls to be papered = 2H(L + B) - Area of doors and windows
=> 2x(5x - L) - 15 = 130
=> 10x^2 - 2xL - 145 = 0
=> 5x^2 - xL - 72.5 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
x = (L +/- sqrt(L^2 + 1450))/10
Since x is the height of the room, it must be greater than 0.
Therefore, we take the positive root.
Also, we know that L + B = 5x.
Therefore, we can write L = 5x - B.
Substituting this in the above equation, we get:
x = (5x - B +/- sqrt((5x - B)^2 + 1450))/10
Simplifying this equation, we get:
24x^2 - 20Bx + B^2 - 1450 = 0
This is a quadratic equation in x with coefficients in terms of B.
We can solve for x using the quadratic formula.
After solving, we get:
x = (5B + sqrt(25B^2 + 139200))/24
Since x is the height of the room, it must be greater than 0.
Therefore, we take the positive root.
Now, we can substitute the value of x in the equation L + B = 5x to get the value of B.
After solving, we get:
B = (5x - L)/4
Substituting the values of x and B in this equation, we get:
B = (5(5B + sqrt(25B^2 + 139200))/24 - L)/4
Simplifying this equation, we get:
B^2 - 24B - 450 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
B = 12 +/- sqrt(294)
Since B is the breadth of the room, it must be less than the semi-perimeter.
Therefore, we take the negative root.
Now, we can substitute the values of B and x in the equation L + B = 5x to get the value of L.
After solving, we get:
L = 5x - 12 - sqrt(294)
Substituting the values of L, B, and x in the equation 2(L + B) + H = 7x, we get:
H = 4x + 6 + sqrt(294)
Therefore, the height of the room is 4x + 6 + sqrt(294).
Approximately, the height of the room is 4.2m.

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
  So, the area of the four walls to be papered is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the room is Rs.260.
  The width of the paper is 50 cm = 0.5 m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2/meter.
  So, the cost of papering per square meter is Rs.4.
  Therefore, (9x^2 - 15) * 4 = 260.

Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x. So, the length of the room will be 3x.
The area of the four walls of the room is (2x*3x)=6x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. So, the area of the four walls that need to be papered is (6x^2 - 15).
The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
The width of the paper is 50cm or 0.5m and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
So, the cost of papering the walls with paper of width 50cm is (Rs.2/1m * 0.5m = Rs.1 per linear meter).
The length of the four walls is 5x, so the cost of papering the walls with paper of width 50cm is (Rs.1/m * 5x = Rs.5x).
Rs.5x = Rs.260 - cost of doors and windows
Rs.5x = Rs.260 - (15 * 2)
Rs.5x = Rs.260 - Rs.30
Rs.5x = Rs.230
x = 46

Let's assume the height of the room is x meters and the semi-perimeter is y meters.
Then, we can form two equations based on the given information:
  x/y = 2/5  ---(1)
  The cost of papering the walls = Rs.260
  Width of the paper = 50 cm = 0.5 m
  Cost of the paper per meter = Rs.2
  Area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m
  Area of the four walls = (semi-perimeter * height) - area of doors and windows
  Area of the four walls = (y+x)*2 - 15
  Cost of papering the four walls = area of the four walls * cost of the paper per meter
  Rs.260 = ((y+x)*2 - 15) * 2 * Rs.2

Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x. Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2. 
The area of the four walls is given by 2*height*(length+semi-perimeter). Substituting the values, we get 2*2x*(9x/2+5x) = 38x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. Hence, the total area of the four walls is 38x^2 + 15.
The cost of papering the walls with paper 50 cm wide at Rs. 2 per meter is Rs. 260. Hence, the cost of papering the walls of the room is 260/2 = 130.
The total length of the four walls is (length+semi-perimeter)*2 = 7x*2. Hence, the total area of the four walls is 7x*2*height = 14x^2.

Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x. Then, the length of the room would be 6x.
The area of the four walls of the room would be (2x*6x) = 12x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the four walls would be (12x^2 - 15).
The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260.
The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
Therefore, the cost of papering the walls would be (0.5*260/2) = Rs. 65.
The cost of papering the walls would also be (area of the four walls * cost of paper per meter).

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x.
  Let's assume the semi-perimeter of the room is 5y.
  Then, the length of the room is 10y/2x = 5y/x.
  The area of the four walls of the room is 2x * (5y/x + 2x) = 10xy + 4x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is the area to be papered.
  The area to be papered is (10xy + 4x^2 - 15).
  The length of the paper needed is (10xy + 4x^2 - 15) / 0.5.
  The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
  The cost of the paper is Rs.260.
  Therefore, (10xy + 4x^2 - 15) / 0.5 * 2 = 260.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get xy + 2x^2 - 15/10 = 65.
  xy + 2x^2 = 7.
  Substituting 2x/y for the given ratio 2:5, we get y = 5x/2.

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  The perimeter of the room is 2 * semi-perimeter = 10x.
  So, the length of the room is 10x/2x = 5.
  The area of the four walls of the room is (2x + 5x) * 5 = 35x.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m, so the area of the four walls to be papered is 35x - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, so the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is 260/(35x-15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm or 0.5m, so the length of the paper required to paper 1 sq.m of the wall is 2m (since the area of the paper is 1 sq.m and the width of the paper is 0.5m).
  Therefore, the cost of paper required to paper 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs. 2/2 = Rs. 1.

Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.
Then, the length of the room is 10y-2x and the breadth of the room is 5y-x.
The area of the walls is (2x(10y-2x)) + (2x(5y-x)) = 26xy - 4x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
The area of the walls is equal to the area of the paper used.
The cost of the paper is Rs. 260.
The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m.
The cost of the paper per meter is Rs. 2.
Therefore, the cost of the paper per sq.m is Rs. 4.
The cost of the paper used is (area of the walls - area of doors and windows) * cost per sq.m = (26xy - 4x^2 - 15) * 4.
Equating the cost of the paper used to Rs. 260, we get (26xy - 4x^2 - 15) * 4 = 260.
Simplifying the above equation, we get 26xy - 4x^2 = 68.
Dividing the above equation by 2x, we get 13y - 2x = 34.
Given that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, we get 2/5 = x/y.
Solving the above equation along with 13y - 2x = 34, we get x = 3.9.
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 2*3.9 = 7.8m.

The area of doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
The area to be papered is 7x^2 - 15.
The cost of papering is Rs.260.
The cost of papering 1 sq.m is 260/(7x^2 - 15).
The cost of papering 1 sq.cm is (260/(7x^2 - 15))/10000.
The length of the room is (5x - 2x)/2 = 3x/2.
The area of one strip of paper is (3x/2)(200) sq.cm.
The number of strips required is (2x)/(50/100) = 4x.
The total area of paper required is (3x/2)(200)(4x) sq.cm.
The total cost of paper is (260/(7x^2 - 15))/10000 * (3x/2)(200)(4x).

  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  If we add the number of employees who take only a winter vacation and the number of employees who take both vacations, we get the total number of employees who take a winter vacation, which is 75. 
  If we subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the total number of employees who take a vacation, we get the number of employees who take only a summer vacation, which is 35.

  We can do this by subtracting 40 from 340 and then dividing the result by 25.

  Using condition (4), we know that F and J must be scheduled in two consecutive weeks, so either F or J must be scheduled for the first or second week.
  If O is scheduled for the first week, then K must be scheduled for the second week, and J must be scheduled for the fifth week. This would mean that F and J are not scheduled in consecutive weeks, which violates condition (4). Therefore, O cannot be scheduled for the first week.
  If O is scheduled for the second week, then K must be scheduled for the first week, and J must be scheduled for the fifth week. This would mean that F and J are scheduled in consecutive weeks, which satisfies condition (4). Therefore, R must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  If O is scheduled for the fourth week, then K must be scheduled for the first week, and J must be scheduled for the fifth week. This would mean that F and J are not scheduled in consecutive weeks, which violates condition (4). Therefore, O cannot be scheduled for the fourth week.

  We need to determine which statement is false.
  Statement A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This statement is false because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  Statement B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This statement is false because Southco does not own the Garza Tower.
  Statement C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This statement is false because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  Statement D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This statement could be true because Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower, but it is false because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  Statement E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This statement is false because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.

  RealProp owns a class 1 building, which can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building, which can only be traded for two class 3 buildings or one class 2 and one class 3 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings, which can only be traded for one class 1 building and one class 3 building or two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trades are:
    - RealProp trades Garza Tower for two Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
    - Southco trades Flores Tower for two Trustcorp's class 3 buildings.
    - Trustcorp trades two class 3 buildings for Southco's Garza Tower.
    - Trustcorp trades one class 1 building and one class 3 building for RealProp's Yates House and Zimmer House.
  From these trades, we can conclude that:
    - Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and cannot be owned by Southco or Trustcorp.
    - Yates House and Zimmer House are owned by RealProp and cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
    - Flores Tower is owned by Southco and cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
    - King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp and cannot be owned by RealProp or Southco.

  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  If RealProp trades one of its class 1 buildings, it must receive two class 2 buildings, and if it trades one of its class 2 buildings, it must receive two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco trades Flores Tower, it must receive two class 3 buildings.
  If Southco trades Lynch Building, it must receive one class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings, it must receive two class 3 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true, as RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This cannot be true, as Southco does not own Garza Tower.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true, as Southco only owns two buildings.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This can be true, as Trustcorp can trade King Building and Meyer Building for Garza Tower and Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This cannot be true, as Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower.

  A trade of one building for one other building of the same class cannot change the number of buildings in each class.
  A trade of one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings will change the number of buildings in each class in the following way: -1 class 1, +2 class 2.
  A trade of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings will change the number of buildings in each class in the following way: -1 class 2, +2 class 3.
  The only way to change the number of buildings in each class is by trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  There are six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option C and D because they only have one photographer assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option E because Mays can only be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Lai is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is not the case.
  Option A is not possible because Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony, and Knutson cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.

  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Only a few of these substances occur in any one species of plant, but the same or similar ones tend to occur in related plants such as the various species that constitute a single family.
  It is these secondary substances that give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Therefore, the relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to the relationship between automobiles and their mechanical components and features.

  The passage discusses an experiment in which young woodpecker finches were split into two groups and reared with different models.
  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
  The researchers concluded that the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components but is enhanced through individual learning.
  The passage also mentions that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because the artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes.

$$\frac{x}{x-3}=x$$
$$x = x(x-3)$$
$$x^2 - 3x = 0$$
$$x(x-3) = 0$$
$$x=0, x=3$$

Therefore, the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are 0 and 3.

  The line passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
  The equation of the line in slope-intercept form is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point(s) lie on the line, we plug in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  For point A: $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0$, which is not equal to 7. Therefore, point A does not lie on the line.

  Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = 0$.
  Substituting these values into the point-slope form, we get $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and let the semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then the perimeter of the room is 2(2x) + 2(5y) = 4x + 10y.
  We know that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, so we can write:
  2x/5y = 2/5
  Cross-multiplying gives: 10x = 10y, or x = y.
  So the perimeter of the room is 4x + 10x = 14x.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, which is the cost of papering an area equal to the area of the walls plus 15 sq.m for doors and windows.
  Let the length of the room be L and the width be W. Then the area of the walls is 2x(L+W), and the area to be papered is (L+W)(2x+5y).
  We know that the width of the paper is 50 cm = 0.5 m, and it costs Rs. 2 per meter.
  So the cost of papering an area of 1 sq.m is Rs. 4, and the cost of papering an area of (L+W)(2x+5y) sq.m is (L+W)(2x+5y) x 4 = 4(2xL+5xW+2xy+5yW).
  We can substitute L = 2x+5y-15 and W = 2x-5y+15 (since the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m) to get:
  Cost of papering = 4(2x(2x+5y-15)+5x(2x-5y+15)+2xy+5y(2x-5y+15)) = 8x^2+80xy+100y^2-120x+300y.
  We know that this cost is Rs. 260, so we can write:
  8x^2+80xy+100y^2-120x+300y = 260
  Dividing both sides by 20, we get:
  2x^2+8xy+5y^2-6x+15y = 13
  Substituting x = y, we get:
  2x^2+13xy-6x+15y = 13
  We know that x/y = 2/5, so we can substitute y = (5/2)x to get:
  2x^2+13x(5/2)x-6x+15(5/2)x = 13
  Simplifying, we get:
  29x^2 = 1300
  x^2 = 45
  x = sqrt(45) = 3sqrt(5)
  So the height of the room is 2x = 6sqrt(5).
  Therefore, the answer is C: 4m.

Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. 
Then, the length of the room is 10y - 4x (as there are two walls of length y and two walls of length 3y - 2x).
We can use the given area and the width of the paper to get the value of (10y - 4x) * 2x = 15 + 1 = 16.
Simplifying this equation, we get 5y^2 - 8xy + 4x^2 = 8.
We also know that 2x/5y = 2/5, which gives us x = 2y/5.
Substituting this in the previous equation, we get 5y^2 - 16y^2/5 + 4(4y^2/25) = 8.
Simplifying this equation, we get y^2 = 25, which gives us y = 5.
Substituting this in the equation x = 2y/5, we get x = 2.

We can start by finding the dimensions of the room using the given ratio.
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x.
Then, the length of the room is 5x - 4x = x.
The area of the four walls is (2x * x) + (2x * 5x) = 12x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
The area of the walls to be papered is 12x^2 - 15.
The cost of papering the walls is given as Rs.260.
The cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall is (260/(12x^2 - 15)) * 100.
The width of the paper is given as 50cm = 0.5m and costs Rs.2 per meter.
So, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of wall using this paper is (2/0.5) = 4.
Therefore, we can equate the two costs to get an equation in x which we can solve for the height of the room.

Calculation:
Let's solve for x first:
(260/(12x^2 - 15)) * 100 = 4
26/(12x^2 - 15) = 1/25
x = 1.5

Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y. Then the length of the room is 5y-4x.
Area of the room = height * (length + breadth)
15 sq.m area is deducted for doors and windows.
Area of the room = 2x(5y-4x) - 15
Cost of papering the walls = perimeter * height * cost of paper per meter
Perimeter = 2*(length + breadth)
Length = 5y - 4x, breadth = 5y/2
Substitute the values and simplify the equation to get the value of y.
Once we have the value of y, we can find the value of x.

The area of the room = x * 2x = 2x^2.
The area of the four walls = 2 * (5x/2) * 2x = 10x^2.
Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
Total area to be papered = 10x^2 - 15.
The cost of papering = (10x^2 - 15) * 2/100 = (x^2 - 3/10) * 26.

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  Given that the area of the room is (5x/2) * 2x = 5x^2, and the area of doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, the area of the four walls is 5x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs. 260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is 260/(5x^2 - 15).
  The cost of papering 1 cm of the wall is (260/(5x^2 - 15)) / 100.
  The cost of papering 1 cm of the wall is Rs. 0.02.
  The total length of the four walls is 2 * (5x/2) + 2 * (9x/2) = 14x.
  The total cost of papering the walls is (14x * height of the room * 0.5)/50 = 0.14x * height of the room.
  Equating this with the cost of papering, we get (0.14x * height of the room) = 260.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y
  Then, the dimensions of the room are 2x * y and 2x * (5y - 2) 
  The area of the four walls of the room is 2 * (2x * y + 2x * (5y - 2)) = 4x(3y - 1)
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m
  The area of the four walls minus the area of doors and windows is the area of the wallpaper required
  The area of the wallpaper required is (4x(3y - 1) - 15) sq.m
  The cost of the wallpaper is Rs.260
  The width of the wallpaper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of the wallpaper is Rs.2 per meter
  The cost of the wallpaper required is (4x(3y - 1) - 15) * 2 / 0.5 = 8(4x(3y - 1) - 15) Rs.
  Equating the cost of the wallpaper required to Rs.260, we get:
  8(4x(3y - 1) - 15) = 260
  Simplifying the above equation, we get:
  4x(3y - 1) - 15 = 32.5
  12xy - 4x - 15 = 32.5
  12xy - 4x = 47.5
  4x(3y - 1) = 47.5 + 15 = 62.5

  - (number of deer with tags in 2002) / (total population) = (number of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample) / (500)
  - We know that 20 deer in the 500 deer sample had tags, so the number of deer with tags in the entire population is (300 + 20) = 320.

  40% of the employees take both a winter and a summer vacation, which is 40 employees.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees.
  To find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we can use the formula:
  (Number of employees taking a summer vacation) - (Number of employees taking both a winter and a summer vacation)
  We know that 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so:
  (Number of employees taking a summer vacation) = 100 - 20 = 80

  (Number of employees taking both a winter and a summer vacation) = 40
  Therefore, the number of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
  (Number of employees taking a summer vacation) - (Number of employees taking both a winter and a summer vacation) = 80 - 40 = 40

  The money she received for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The money she received for brass coins is 25y cents.
  According to the problem, she received $3.40 in total, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to find the smallest possible integer value of x that satisfies the above equation.

  Similarly, the total amount she would get from the brass coins = 25y cents.
  We know that the total amount she got from the dive is $3.40 = 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we should try to find the smallest possible value of x that satisfies the equation.
  One way to do this is to use trial and error.
  Let's start with x = 1, then we get 20 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 12.
  This means the coin-diver brought 1 copper coin and 12 brass coins, which is a total of 13 coins.
  Let's check if this is the minimum number of copper coins.
  If we decrease x to 0, then we get 25y = 340, which is not possible since y is an integer.
  If we increase x to 2, then we get 40 + 25y = 340, which gives y = 12.
  This means the coin-diver brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins, which is a total of 14 coins.

  We also know that after one dive, she got $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:

  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  To do that, we can start by assuming that she brought 0 brass coins and try to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought.
  If she brought 0 brass coins, then the equation becomes:

  1. x + y = total number of coins
  2. 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which means we need to minimize x.
  Let's solve for x in equation 2:

  20x + 25y = 340 (multiplying both sides by 100 to get rid of decimals)
  4x + 5y = 68 (dividing both sides by 5)
  x = (68 - 5y) / 4

Let the original price of the product be $100.
After a 30% reduction, the price becomes $70.
To increase the price from $70 to $100, we need to increase it by $30.
The percentage increase can be calculated as follows:
Percentage increase = (increase in price / original price) x 100
Percentage increase = (30 / 70) x 100
Percentage increase = 42.86%
Therefore, the answer is B: 42.86%

  Let the original price be P.
  The price of the product is reduced by 30%, so the new price is 0.7P (since 30% of P is 0.3P, and the new price is P - 0.3P = 0.7P).
  We want to find the percentage increase needed to make the new price equal to the original price P.
  Let x be the percentage increase needed.
  Then, the new price after the increase is 0.7P + (x/100)(0.7P) = P.
  Simplifying this equation, we get:
  0.7P + 0.007P x = P
  0.007P x = 0.3P
  x = (0.3P/0.007P) * 100
  x = 42.86%

Li Ming argues that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions because unemployed people will not have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
To weaken this argument, we need to show that unemployed people can still buy goods other than the necessities of life even when the economy is deteriorating.
Option A talks about how the company will hire more people after the economic situation improves, but this doesn't address the current situation of unemployment.
Option B talks about consumer beliefs but doesn't address the issue of unemployed people buying goods.
Option C is incorrect because it actually strengthens Li Ming's argument.
Option D suggests that unemployed people can compress expenditures and save money during the period of economic deterioration, which they can then use for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point. This weakens Li Ming's argument that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.

  Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store.
  The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
  
  A: Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. - This statement is not necessarily true because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  
  B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. - This statement is true because the museum displays only twentieth-century works.
  
  C: There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. - This statement is not necessarily true because the museum store sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  
  D: Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector. - This statement is not necessarily true because Hopper's Nighthawks is not part of the museum's permanent collection.
  
  E: Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. - This statement is not mentioned in the given context.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work.

  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of the world.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  We need to find an answer that weakens the reasoning above.
  If people who watch below-average television also overestimate the risks, then the problem is not solely due to television.
  If people who watch above-average television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, it weakens the argument.
  If people who watch below-average television have an accurate idea of the likelihood of natural disasters, it strengthens the argument.
  If people who are well-informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to become well-informed in ways other than watching television, it weakens the argument.
  If people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch above-average television, it strengthens the argument.

  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument relies on the assumption that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to believe that they will be victims of a natural disaster.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that contradicts this assumption.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether watching television affects people's beliefs about the risks of natural disasters.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant because it does not address the issue of whether watching television affects people's beliefs about the risks of natural disasters.
  Answer choice C supports the argument, so it is not the correct answer.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology research and the validity of the modular theory of mind. It also explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works and the problems with the subtractive method.
Option A states that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain, but the passage suggests that this may not be the case. Option B is incorrect because the passage does not mention the rate of oxygen use in regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task. Option D is incorrect because the passage does not provide information about the baseline measurements of oxygen use indicating high metabolic activity in some regions of the brain at all times. Option E is incorrect because the passage does not mention anger specifically. 
Option C states that during certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use than the rest of the brain. This is supported by the passage, which explains that FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use during a cognitive task compared to a control condition. Therefore, the correct answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans, specifically FMRI, to study cognitive tasks and the modular theory of mind. The passage also describes the subtractive method used in FMRI and how it produces striking images of the brain at work. 
Statement A is not supported by the passage because the author argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid.
Statement B is not supported by the passage because it is not mentioned whether regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.
Statement C is supported by the passage because the passage describes the FMRI as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity, and that the differential rate of oxygen use is what is depicted. 
Statement D is not supported by the passage because the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method are not described as showing that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans and the modular theory of mind. It also explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is used to create brain scans. The passage suggests that the modular theory of mind may not be valid. The FMRI method used for brain scans may produce a false impression of neat functional localization. The FMRI shows the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain. The entire brain is active in both conditions.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology as a research method, and how it depends on the modular theory of mind. The modular theory of mind suggests that mental processes are distinct entities and are located in specific regions of the brain. However, the author argues that this may not be true, and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The passage also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans. The FMRI produces a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. The baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. However, the entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method may obscure the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. 
Action: Answer(""C"")  
Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

  The passage describes how Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles.
  The first style was late-Romantic music with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style was music without a tonal basis.
  The third style was music that used the 12-tone technique to bring order to nontonal music.
  The passage suggests that Schoenberg's music became more condensed and difficult to follow as his career progressed.
  The author suggests that what makes Schoenberg's music essential is that it delineated emotional states that music had not recorded before.
  The author does not suggest that any of the styles are inexplicable departures from the previous style.
  The author does suggest that the second style is an ""inevitable step"" in the historical development of music, but it is unclear whether this means it is a natural progression from the first style.

  The researchers found that five individual woodpecker finches developed a novel tool-using technique.
  This technique deviated from the typical tool-using behavior performed by birds in the wild.
  The birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.

  There were $b$ businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year.
  The total number of businesses, $y$, the DBA plans to have as members $x$ years from now should be $b$ plus the number of businesses that will be added in $x$ years.
  Option A, $y=n x+b$, only considers the number of businesses that will be added and does not include the initial number of businesses in the DBA.
  Option B, $y=n x-b$, subtracts the number of businesses in the DBA from the total number of businesses and does not make sense.
  Option C, $y=b(n)^{x}$, only considers the initial number of businesses in the DBA and does not include the number of businesses that will be added in $x$ years.

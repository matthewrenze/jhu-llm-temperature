  Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.
  Then, the perimeter will be 2*(2x) + 2*(5y) = 4x + 10y.
  Also, semi-perimeter is (perimeter)/2 = (4x+10y)/2 = 2x+5y.
  Therefore, x = 2y.
  Let the length, breadth, and height of the room be l, b, and 2x, respectively.
  Then, the cost of papering the walls of the room = cost of paper required * cost per meter.
  The cost of paper required = length of paper required * cost per meter.
  Length of paper required = perimeter of the room * height of the room = (l+b+2*(2x)) * 2x = (l+b+4x) * 2x = (l+b+8y) * 4y.
  Now, we need to find the height of the room given that it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.
  The area of the four walls of the room = length of paper required * width of paper = (l+b+8y) * 4y * (50/100) = 2(l+b+8y)y.
  The area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
  Total area to be papered = area of the four walls of the room - area of the doors and windows = 2(l+b+8y)y - 15.
  Now, we have all the information to solve for x and find the height of the room.
  We can solve the above equation for (l+b) and substitute for x to get the height of the room.

  Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = (5x - 4x)/2 = x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x * x/2) + (2x * 5x/2) = 7x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls to be papered = 7x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering = (7x^2 - 15) * 2 / 100 = (7x^2 - 15) / 50.
  Given the cost of papering = Rs.260.
  Therefore, (7x^2 - 15) / 50 = 260 => 7x^2 - 15 = 13000 => 7x^2 = 13015 => x^2 = 1859.

Let's consider the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x. Then, the length of the room can be calculated as (5x-4x) = x. 
The area of the four walls can be calculated as 2x * x + 2x * 5x = 12x^2. 
Area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m. 
Area to be papered = (12x^2 - 15). 
Cost of papering = Rs. 260. Cost of papering 1 sq.m = 260/(12x^2-15) Rs. 
Cost of papering 1 sq.m = 2 Rs. 
So, 2/(0.5) = 4 sq.m of paper is used for 1 rupee. 
Area to be papered = (12x^2 - 15) sq.m. 
Cost of papering = (12x^2 - 15) / 4 Rs.

  The other two sides of the room are (10y - 2x)/2 = 5y - x.
  The area of the room is 2x(5y - x) = 10xy - 2x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
  Therefore, the area of the walls is 10xy - 2x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter.
  Therefore, the length of the paper required is 130m (260/2).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m.

Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x, then the semi-perimeter would be (5x/2)*2 = 5x.
The perimeter of the room would then be 2*5x/2 + 2x = 6x.
If the width of the room is y, then the area of the room would be 2x*y.
Let's calculate the value of x and y to find the height of the room.
The cost of papering the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter is Rs.260.
The area of the walls is (5x/2)*2x - 15 = 5x^2 - 15.

  The area of the four walls (excluding doors and windows) is 2x(5x + 5y - 2x) = 10x(y - x).
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls (including doors and windows) is 10x(y - x) + 15.
  The cost of papering the walls with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter is Rs.260.

Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x. 
Then the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = (5x - 4x)/2 = x/2.
The area of the four walls is (semiperimeter * height) = 5x*2x = 10x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. 
The area of the four walls is equal to the area of the wallpaper used minus the area of the doors and windows.
The cost of the wallpaper is Rs. 260 and the total length of the walls to be covered is (2*length + 2*height) = 2(5x/2) + 2(2x) = 9x. Therefore, the cost per meter of the wallpaper is 260/9.
The width of the wallpaper is 50cm or 0.5m.
The total length of the wallpaper needed is (total area of the four walls)/(width of wallpaper) = 20x^2/0.5 = 40x^2.
The total cost of the wallpaper is (total length of wallpaper used) * (cost per meter of wallpaper) = 40x^2 * 260/9.
Equating the area of the four walls to the cost of the wallpaper used minus the area of the doors and windows, we get:

  Let the height of the room be 2x.
  Let the semi-perimeter of the room be 5y.
  We know that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, we can write:
  2x/5y = 2/5
  Cross-multiplying, we get:
  2y = x
  We also know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. Therefore, the area of the walls is:
  Area of walls = Total area of room - Area of doors and windows
                = 2x(5y) - 15
                = 10xy - 15
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260. The width of the paper is 50 cm. Therefore, the length of the paper required is:
  Length of paper required = Area of walls / Width of paper
                           = (10xy - 15) / (0.5)
                           = 20xy - 30
  The cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the cost of the paper required is:
  Cost of paper required = Length of paper required x Cost per meter
                         = (20xy - 30) x 2
                         = 40xy - 60
  We can substitute 2y for x in the above expression to get:
  Cost of paper required = 80y^2 - 60
  We know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs.260. Therefore, we can write:
  80y^2 - 60 = 260
  Solving for y, we get:
  y^2 = 4
  y = 2 (we take the positive value since y is a length)
  We can substitute 2 for y in the expression 2y to get the height of the room:
  Height of room = 2 x 2

  - 0.40n is the number of employees who take a winter and summer vacation.
  - 0.20n is the number of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation.
Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is:

We also know that the total percentage of employees who take a vacation (either winter or summer or both) is:

Simplifying the equation, we get:

  Q = 0.35n/100 + xn/100

We also know that the percentage of employees who take neither a winter nor a summer vacation is 20%, so:

Substituting n = 100, we get:

  Q = 0.35 + x
  x = Q - 0.35
We want to find Q, so we need to solve for x.
We know that the total percentage of employees who take a vacation (either winter or summer or both) is:

  So, the total amount of money she gets for 'x' copper coins is 20*x cents.
  And, the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is (3.40 - 20*x) cents.

  The answer is the integer value of 'x' that makes the number of brass coins an integer.
  We can use trial and error to find the answer.
  Let's start by assuming 'x' to be 0, then she brought (3.40 - 20*0)/25 = 0.136 = 13.6 brass coins.

  If 'x' is 1, then she brought (3.40 - 20*1)/25 = 0.112 = 11.2 brass coins.
  This value is not an integer, so we need to increase 'x' further.
  If 'x' is 2, then she brought (3.40 - 20*2)/25 = 0.088 = 8.8 brass coins.
  This value is not an integer, so we need to increase 'x' further.
  If 'x' is 3, then she brought (3.40 - 20*3)/25 = 0.064 = 6.4 brass coins.
  This value is not an integer, so we need to increase 'x' further.
  If 'x' is 4, then she brought (3.40 - 20*4)/25 = 0.04 = 4 brass coins.

  If x = 1, then 20(1) + 25y = 340, which gives y = 12.4, which is not a whole number.
  If x = 2, then 20(2) + 25y = 340, which gives y = 10.4, which is not a whole number.
  If x = 3, then 20(3) + 25y = 340, which gives y = 8.8, which is not a whole number.
  If x = 4, then 20(4) + 25y = 340, which gives y = 7.2, which is a whole number.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 4.
  The answer is A: 4.

  Statement A talks about the reason why Qiankun ranks first, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Statement C acknowledges that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not shake the traditional view either.
  Statement D talks about the story behind the naming of Kun Gua, but it does not shake the traditional view either.
  Statement B states that the hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory or the sense of meaning alone, but only by combining the two. This statement challenges the traditional view that there is no meaning behind the names of the Gua and suggests that there is a deeper meaning behind the names.

  If S is performed fourth, then either O or L must be performed last.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if S is performed fourth, then L must be performed last.
  P is performed at some time before S, and at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and F must be performed third. But this would mean that R must be performed immediately after F, which contradicts the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed before S, and F and R must be performed between P and S. If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed immediately after T, and H and L must be performed between F and R. But this would mean that there are more than two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, T cannot be performed immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then O must be performed fifth, and P must be performed before S. If F is performed second, then H and L must be performed before R. But the eighth composition performed is either L or H, so if L and H are both performed before R, then there would be no composition left to perform after R and before S or after S and before O, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, H and L cannot both be performed before R.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then O must be performed first, and P must be performed before S. If F is performed second, then H and L must be performed between F and R. Since the eighth composition performed is either L or H, and L must be performed last, then H must be performed sixth, and S must be performed seventh. Therefore, the accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, F, H.

  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space (either #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6). However, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6. Also, Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6. However, Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, which means Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4. Therefore, the possible assignments for parking spaces are as follows:
    - #1: Togowa; #2: Souza; #3: Robertson; #4: Young; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu

    B) Kim, Tiao
        Kim cannot work in Zone 3. If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Udall must work in Zone 2 and Parra must work in Zone 1. Therefore, Stuckey should work in Zone 3, but Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, which is not possible. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

  From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there are two possible cases:
  Case 1: If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well because he works in the same sales zone as Udall. So, the remaining sales representatives Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well. This gives us the sales representatives working in Zone 3 as Kim, Mahr, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  Case 2: If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 3 as well because he works in the same sales zone as Udall. So, the remaining sales representatives Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3. However, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  We need to find an action that aligns with this principle.
  Choice A describes a mathematical puzzle with no relation to practical concerns, so it does not align with the principle.
  Choice B describes a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems. This does not align with the principle because it does not have any promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice C describes a research position in the physics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics faculty. This is not an action, so it cannot be the answer.
  Choice D describes a foundation deciding not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior. This does not align with the principle because it has the promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

The passage explains the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans in psychology.
The modular theory of mind is based on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
However, this premise is challenged by the fact that the various mental processes may be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a research method that shows the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
The FMRI depicts the differential rate of oxygen use, and the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
The entire brain is active in both conditions, so the subtractive method produces a false impression of neat functional localization.

  Tocqueville believes that men and women have different functions and tasks to fulfill in society, and that improvement does not consist in making beings so dissimilar do pretty nearly the same things, but in getting each of them to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Mill believes that every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them. There need be no fear that women will take out of the hands of men any occupation which men perform better than they. Each individual will prove his or her capacities by trial.

  Tocqueville believes that the Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman.
  Tocqueville believes that nature has appointed such wide differences between the physical and moral constitution of man and woman, her manifest design was to give a distinct employment to their various faculties.
  Mill believes that the proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to.
  Mill believes that every occupation should be open to all, without favor or discouragement to any, and employments will fall into the hands of those men or women who are found by experience to be most capable of worthily exercising them.
  Mill believes that to interfere beforehand by an arbitrary limit, and declare that whatever be the genius, talent, energy, or force of mind, of an individual of a certain sex or class, those faculties shall not be exerted, or shall be exerted only in some few of the many modes in which others are permitted to use theirs, is not only an injustice to the individual, and a detriment to society, which loses what it can ill spare, but is also the most effectual way of providing that, in the sex or class so fettered, the qualities which are not permitted to be exercised shall not exist.
  Therefore, Tocqueville believes that an individual's position should be determined by their sex, while Mill believes that an individual's abilities should be the determining factor.

  Parsons turned from a political Socialist to the non-political phase of Socialism—Anarchism—because in its philosophy he believes he can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.
  The answer is D: vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

  Parsons thinks that organized governments use their concentrated power to retard progress.
  Governments never lead; they follow progress.
  When the prison, stake or scaffold can no longer silence the voice of the protesting minority, progress moves on a step, but not until then.
  Parsons believes that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  Parsons thinks that it would not be the safest nor best policy for society, as a whole, to entrust the management of all its affairs, with all their manifold deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite man.

  The passage discusses research that explores the effect of having a large, dominant competitor on smaller brands.
  The research found that highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands rather than harming them.
  Small brands see consumer support go up when they are faced with a competitive threat from large brands.
  The ""framing-the-game"" effect can help a small establishment and spur consumers to make a purchase that supports the smaller competitor.
  The studies suggest that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

Explanation:
  Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(x-3)$:
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2} \Rightarrow 2x = \frac{2 x(x-3)}{x-3}$$
  
  Simplify and solve for $x$:

  $$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2\times 0}{2}$$

  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y=mx+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the $y$-intercept is $0$.
  Thus, the equation of the line is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
  We need to check which point(s) satisfy this equation.
  Plugging in the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point, we can see that only point A satisfies the equation.

  We can use the point-slope form of a line to solve the problem.
  The equation of the line that passes through the origin and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$ is $y=\frac{1}{7}x$.
  We can substitute the given points into the equation to see which point lies on the line.
  A) $(0,7)$: $y=\frac{1}{7}x=\frac{1}{7}(0)=0 \neq 7$
  B) $(1,7)$: $y=\frac{1}{7}x=\frac{1}{7}(1)=\frac{1}{7}\neq 7$
  C) $(7,7)$: $y=\frac{1}{7}x=\frac{1}{7}(7)=1=7$

  The line passes through the origin, which means that the $y$-intercept is $0$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$.
  The equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To find which point lies on the line, we can substitute the $x$ and $y$ values of each point into the equation and see if the equation is true.
  Let's check each point:

  For point A: $(0,7)$
  $y = \frac{1}{7}x$
  $7 = \frac{1}{7}(0)$
  $7 = 0$
  This is not true, so point A does not lie on the line.

  For point B: $(1,7)$
  $y = \frac{1}{7}x$
  $7 = \frac{1}{7}(1)$
  $7 = \frac{1}{7}$
  This is not true, so point B does not lie on the line.

  For point C: $(7,7)$
  $y = \frac{1}{7}x$
  $7 = \frac{1}{7}(7)$
  $7 = 1$
  This is not true, so point C does not lie on the line.

  For point D: $(14,2)$
  $y = \frac{1}{7}x$
  $2 = \frac{1}{7}(14)$
  $2 = 2$
  This is true, so point D lies on the line.

  $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x+6}}$
  We can then simplify the expression by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the fraction in the denominator.
  $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x+6}} = \frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$
  Therefore, the answer is B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.

  We are given: $x > 3$
  We need to simplify the expression: $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}$
  We can start by finding the common denominator of the two fractions in the denominator.
  The common denominator is: $(x+2)(x+3)$
  We can now combine the two fractions in the denominator by adding their numerators and putting it over the common denominator.
  This gives us: $\frac{1}{\frac{x+2+x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  Simplifying the numerator gives us: $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  Dividing by a fraction is equivalent to multiplying by its reciprocal.
  So, we can multiply by $\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$ to get rid of the fraction in the denominator.
  This gives us: $\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}} \cdot \frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$
  Simplifying, we get: $\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$

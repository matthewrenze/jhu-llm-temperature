Let's first find the height of the room.
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5x.
Then, the length of the room would be (5x - 2x) = 3x.
The area of the four walls would be 2h(l+b) = 2(2x)(3x) = 12x^2.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
So, the total area to be papered would be (12x^2 - 15) sq.m.
Since the paper is 50 cm wide, we need to find the length of the paper required.
Let the length of the paper required be L meters.
Then, 2(L)(50/100) = (12x^2 - 15), which simplifies to L = (6x^2 - 15)/2.
The cost of papering the walls is given as Rs.260.
So, (L)(2) = 260, which simplifies to L = 130.
Substituting the value of L in the above equation, we get 6x^2 - 15 = 260/2 = 130.
Simplifying this equation, we get 6x^2 = 145, which gives x^2 = 145/6.
Therefore, x = sqrt(145/6)/sqrt(6) = (5/2)sqrt(6)/3.
Hence, the height of the room is 2x = 2(5/2)sqrt(6)/3 = (5/3)sqrt(6).
Rounding off to one decimal place, we get the height of the room as 3.9m.

Let's assume the height of the room to be 2x and semi-perimeter to be 5x.
So, the dimensions of the room will be 2x * 5x.
Also, the given area of the room is 15 sq.m.
Now, the area of the four walls will be (2x * 5x) * 2.
We have to subtract the area of doors and windows from the total area of the four walls to get the final area to be papered.
Given, the paper is 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter, which means the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2/2 = Rs.1.
So, the cost of paper required to cover the final area will be (final area * height of the room) * cost per meter.
Now, we have to solve for the height of the room using the given information.

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x. 
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = (5x-4x)/2 = x/2.
  Now, the area of the four walls is (2x)(x/2) + (2x)(5x/2) = 6x^2.
  The area of doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. Therefore, the total area to be papered is 6x^2 - 15 sq.m.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, which means that the cost per sq.m is 260/(6x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 0.5m and costs Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the cost per sq.m of paper is Rs.4.
  Equating the two costs per sq.m, we get 260/(6x^2 - 15) = 4.
  Solving this equation, we get x = 1.5.

Let's assume the height of a room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5y.
Then, the length of the room = 5y - 2x
We know that the area of the room is equal to the cost of the wallpaper plus the area of the doors and windows. 
Area of the room = Cost of wallpaper + Area of the doors and windows
(5y * 2x) / 2 = (260 / 2) / 2 + 15
5yx = 140 + 15
5yx = 155
yx = 31
2x/5y = 2/5
2(31)/5y = 2/5
y = 77.5
5y - 2x = Length of the room
5(77.5) - 2(2x) = Length of the room
387.5 - 4x = Length of the room
Area of the room = 2x * 77.5 + 50 * (387.5 - 4x) / 100

  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = (5x - 4x)/2 = x/2
  The cost of papering the walls = cost of the paper * length of the paper * height of the room
  Cost of the paper = Rs.2/meter
  Length of the paper = (2 * length of the room + 2 * height of the room) = 2(x/2 + 2x) = 5x
  Height of the paper = height of the room = 2x
  Area of the room = Semi-perimeter * height of the room = 5x * 2x = 10x^2
  Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
  Total area to be papered = Area of the room - Area of doors and windows = 10x^2 - 15
  Total cost = Rs.260
  Cost per unit area = Total cost / Total area = 260/(10x^2 - 15)
  Cost per unit area = Cost of the paper * width of the paper = 2 * 0.5 = 1 Rs./sq.m

Let the height of the room be 2x.
Let the width of the room be y.
The semi-perimeter is ((2x+y)/2) = (2x+y)/2
The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, so we can write (2x)/(2x+y) = 2/5, which simplifies to y = 6x.
Let the length of the room be L.
The area of the four walls is (2x+2y)L = (2x+12x)L = 14xL.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
The area of the four walls minus the area of the doors and windows is equal to the area of the wallpaper needed.
The total area of the four walls is 14xL = (260/2) * (100/2) sq. cm = 6500 sq. cm.
The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m = 150000 sq. cm.
The area of the wallpaper needed is (14xL - 150000) sq. cm.
The width of the wallpaper is 50 cm, so the length of the wallpaper needed is (14xL - 150000)/50 cm.
The cost of the wallpaper is Rs.2 per meter.
The cost of the wallpaper needed is (2/100) * (14xL - 150000) Rs.

Let's first understand what semi-perimeter means:
semi-perimeter = (perimeter of the room) / 2
Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5y
Then, the length of the room will be 10y - 4x (as there are two doors/windows of 15 sq.m each)
The area of the four walls of the room (excluding doors/windows) = length * height * 2 = (10y - 4x) * (2x) * 2 = 4x(10y - 4x)
The total area to be covered by the paper = area of four walls + area of doors/windows = 4x(10y - 4x) + 15
The total length of the walls = perimeter of the room = 2(length + height) = 2(10y - 2x)
The length of paper required = total length of walls * width of paper = 2(10y - 2x) * 0.5 = 10y - 2x
The cost of papering the room = length of paper required * cost of 1 meter paper = (10y - 2x) * 2 = 20y - 4x
Given, cost of papering the room = Rs. 260
Therefore, 20y - 4x = 260
Also, given height of the room to its semi-perimeter = 2:5
Therefore, 2x/5y = 2/5
Solving the above two equations we get, x = 1.3 and y = 3.25

  Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x
  Therefore, the semi-perimeter of the room would be (2x + 5x)/2 = 3.5x
  We know that the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  So, 2x/3.5x = 2/5
  Solving this equation, we get x = 3.5
  So, the height of the room is 2x = 2(3.5) = 7 meters.
  Let's calculate the area of the four walls of the room.
  The perimeter of the room is 2(2x + 5x) = 14x
  The height of the room is 2x = 7 meters
  So, the area of the four walls of the room is 7 x 14x = 98x^2 square meters.
  We need to subtract the area of doors and windows (15 sq.m) from this area.
  So, the area of the walls to be papered is 98x^2 - 15
  The length of the paper required is the perimeter of the room which is 14x meters.
  The cost of the paper is Rs. 2 per meter.
  So, the cost of the paper for the four walls is 2 x 14x = 28x rupees.
  We know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260.
  So, 28x = 260

The height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5 means that the height is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x.
Let's consider the width of the room as y, then the length of the room is (5x - 2x) = 3x.
The area of the four walls of the room will be (2*2x*y + 2*3x*y) = 10xy.
The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m, therefore the area of the four walls of the room (excluding doors and windows) is 10xy - 15.
The area of the four walls is equal to the product of the width of the paper (0.5 m) and the perimeter of the room multiplied by the height of the room.
Therefore, 0.5 * 2(5x)/(10xy - 15) = 2
Solving the above equation we get xy = 16.
We know that the semi-perimeter of the room is 5x, therefore the perimeter of the room is 10x.
The area of the walls of the room (excluding doors and windows) is (10xy - 15) = 145 sq.m
Therefore, 10x * h = 145

Let's assume that the height of the room is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x. Therefore, the length of the room = 5x/2π. 
Area of four walls of the room = height × semi-perimeter. 
Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
Area of four walls of the room = total area - area of doors and windows = (length of room × height) - 15.
Cost of papering the wall = Rs. 260.
Cost of papering the wall = cost per running meter × length of the wall.
Cost per running meter = Rs. 2.
Length of the wall = semi-perimeter × height = 5x × 2x = 10x^2.
Using the above equations, we can form an equation in x and solve for x, which will give us the height of the room.

Calculation: 
Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
Length of the room = 5x/2π
Area of four walls = 2x * 5x = 10x^2
Area of four walls = (5x/2π) * 2x = 5x^2/π

Area of four walls of the room = total area - area of doors and windows
10x^2 = (5x^2/π) + 15
x^2 = 6π/5

Length of the wall = 10x^2 = 120π/5
Cost of papering the wall = Rs. 260
Cost per running meter = Rs. 2
Length of the wall = 120π/5

  Let's assume that the total number of employees in the company is 100.
  Then, the number of employees who take a winter vacation is 75.
  The number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations is 40.
  The number of employees who take neither winter nor summer vacations is 20.
  To find the number of employees who take only summer vacations, we need to subtract the number of people who take both winter and summer vacations from the number of people who take summer vacations.
  The total number of employees who take summer vacations is (100 - 20) * Q%, where Q is the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Therefore, (100 - 20) * Q% - 40 = (80Q - 40) employees take only summer vacations.
  We know that the number of employees who take winter vacations is 75.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations plus the number of employees who take only winter vacations is 75.
  Thus, 75 = 40 + X, where X is the number of employees who take only winter vacations.
  Solving for X, we get X = 35.
  Therefore, the number of employees who take only summer vacations is (80Q - 40) - 35 = 80Q - 75.
  We want to find Q%.
  80Q - 75 = (100 - 75 - 20) * Q%
  80Q - 75 = 5Q%
  80Q = 5Q% + 75
  Q = (5Q% + 75) / 80
  Q% = Q * 100

Also, F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, so F must be in the fifth week. We still have O and R to be arranged, but we know that O and S cannot perform continuously, so O must be in the fourth week and R must be in the second week.

Li Ming's rebuttal is that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions because unemployed people will not have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.
We need to find an option that suggests people may have money to buy goods other than necessities even when they are unemployed.
Option A suggests that many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed, which implies that people who were unemployed before may have saved some money to buy goods other than necessities.
Option B talks about consumer belief but does not relate to Li Ming's rebuttal.
Option C states that the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food and does not support Zhang Qiang's argument.
Option D suggests that unemployed people will compress expenditures and have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point, which invalidates Li Ming's rebuttal.

  Zhang Qiang argues that falling prices stimulate people to increase their living consumption, leading to improved economic conditions.
  Li Ming argues that if people are unemployed, they will not have the money to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life, so falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  To weaken Li Ming's rebuttal, we need to provide evidence that even if people are unemployed, they still have the ability to increase their consumption and buy goods, even if it's just necessities.
  Option A provides evidence that when the economic situation improves, many people will be reemployed and buy goods that have been delayed. This suggests that even if people are unemployed during a period of economic downturn, they will eventually have the money to buy goods and increase consumption when they have a job.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option C actually strengthens Li Ming's argument by suggesting that even unemployed people can only buy necessities, not goods beyond that.
  Option D provides evidence that during the period of economic downturn, even unemployed people can compress expenditures, which suggests that they can save money for future consumption when they have a job. This weakens Li Ming's argument by suggesting that even if people are unemployed, they can still save money and eventually increase their consumption when they have a job.

  Answer choice A is not possible because it states that the buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building which are all class 2, but the context states that RealProp does not own any class 2 buildings.
  Answer choice B is possible because RealProp owns the Garza Tower which is class 1, and Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building which is class 2.
  Answer choice C is not possible because it states that Southco owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building which are all class 2, but the context states that Trustcorp owns these buildings.
  Answer choice D is possible because Trustcorp owns the Yates House which is class 3.
  Answer choice E is not possible because it states that Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, but the context states that RealProp and Southco own these buildings, respectively.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are exactly three sales zones, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Since Quinn is not one of the sales representatives mentioned in the given conditions, we need to consider all the possible sales zones where Quinn can work.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao (but not both) must work in Zone 1 as well, which means that Tiao or Udall (but not both) must work in Zone 2. However, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there would be at least four sales representatives working in Zone 3, which means that both Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 3. Therefore, if Quinn works in Zone 1, he cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall (Choice E).
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall (but not both) must work in Zone 2 as well, which means that Parra must work in Zone 1. However, since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there would be at least four sales representatives working in Zone 3, which means that both Stuckey and Udall cannot work in Zone 3.

  Since Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall (Choice E) or Tiao (Choice D), the answer is either A, B, or C.

  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.

    - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    - Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    - Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.

  We do not know where Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work.
  However, we know that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall because they already work together.
  We also know that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra because they already work together.
  This means that Quinn must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 1 (because they work in the same sales zone), and Tiao works in Zone 2 (because Udall cannot work in Zone 2 if Tiao works in Zone 1, and we know that Tiao works in either Zone 1 or Zone 2). This would leave Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall to work in Zone 3. However, this would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  This means that Quinn must work in Zone 3, along with at least one of Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or Udall. We know that there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be at least three representatives in Zone 3. This means that at least three of Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall work in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao, because if Quinn works in Zone 3 with Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, then Tiao must work in Zone 2.

  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1, and no one works in Zone 2. Then, the number of representatives in each zone is less than the number in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Tiao is not in Zone 2 (because Tiao and Udall cannot be in the same zone). Therefore, Udall is in Zone 2, and Parra is in Zone 3.

  We are given that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  We are also given that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  We are told that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that there are exactly 7 sales representatives in total.
  Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, at least 3 representatives work in Zone 3.
  We can use the following table to keep track of our deductions:
  
    | Zone 1 | Zone 2 | Zone 3
  --|--------|--------|--------
  P |        |        |

  M |        |        |
  
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2 and Tiao works in Zone 3. 
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn also works in Zone 3. This means that there are four sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the information given in the question.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 2, which means that Quinn and Parra work in Zone 3.
  We still need to assign Kim and Mahr to the three sales zones.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr cannot both work in Zone 3, so one of them must work in Zone 1. We assign Kim to Zone 1 and Mahr to Zone 3.
  Now we can answer the question. Quinn is already assigned to Zone 3, so the sales representatives who cannot be assigned to Zone 3 are Stuckey, Udall, Tiao, Kim, and Mahr. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as D: Tiao.

  The argument is about the justification for imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe, and therefore, it is necessary to have stronger evidence or an admission of responsibility to be sure of the polluter's identity before imposing the penalty.
  Principle A states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  This principle helps to justify the reasoning in the argument because it supports the position that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is necessary before imposing a severe penalty.

Option B does not weaken the argument, it supports it.
Option C weakens the argument by stating that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. This means that the amount of television watched has an impact on the perception of risk.

  The author explains that brain scans reveal well-defined areas that ""light up"" in response to various cognitive tasks, but the entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method obscures the fact that all distributed brain functions are active.
  The passage supports answer choice C, which states that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage describes the use of neuroimaging in psychology as a research method, which depends on the modular theory of mind. According to the critique of this theory, mental activity and the physical processes that constitute it are not decomposable into independent modules. Brain scans do reveal well-defined areas that ""light up"" in response to various cognitive tasks. The FMRI is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, and what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use. The entire brain is active in both conditions, and the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. Therefore, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology.
  The modular theory of mind is a premise on which the use of neuroimaging in psychology is based.
  The modular theory of mind posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  But the critique of the modular theory of mind is that the various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  Brain scans reveal well-defined areas that ""light up,"" in response to various cognitive tasks.
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  FMRI actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use, which is the result of a subtraction.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions, and produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The modular theory of mind is attractive in part because it is illustrated so well by the products of the subtractive method.
  
  Based on this, the most strongly supported statement is that ""During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain."" Therefore, the answer is C.

The passage also considers the modular theory of mind and the use of neuroimaging in psychology. It highlights the fact that the modular theory of mind is not valid and that mental processes are likely to be properties of general mental activity distributed throughout the brain. In the case of FMRI, the brain scan is the result of a subtraction where the differential rate of oxygen use is measured.

  Beecher argues that women's duties and influence are no less important or all-pervading than men's duties and influence, but the mode of gaining influence and exercising power should be different and peculiar.
  Beecher argues that a man may act on society through the collision of intellect, public debate, sense of shame, fear, personal interest, coercion by public sentiment, and physical force, but women can only appeal to the kindly, generous, peaceful, and benevolent principles.
  Beecher argues that women should win every thing by peace and love, making herself so much respected, esteemed, and loved that to yield to her opinions and to gratify her wishes will be the free-will offering of the heart.
  Beecher argues that women should accomplish this in the domestic and social circle, becoming so cultivated and refined in intellect, benevolent in feeling and action, unassuming and unambitious that collision and competition will be banished, and every heart will repose in her presence.
  Beecher argues that then fathers, husbands, and sons will find an influence thrown around them, to which they will yield not only willingly but proudly.
  Beecher argues that a woman may seek the aid of co-operation and combination among her own sex to assist her in her appropriate offices of piety, charity, maternal and domestic duty, but whatever, in any measure, throws a woman into the attitude of a combatant, either for herself or others - whatever binds her in a party conflict - whatever obliges her in any way to exert coercive influences, throws her out of her appropriate sphere.

  Based on these, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks that positive social change will take place only when individuals rise up and compel governments to address their concerns.

Explanation:
  Multiplying both sides by $2(x-3)$ gives us:

  Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:

- Her budget for paying the staff members is no more than $\$ 9,700$ per week
- Let $x$ be the number of junior directors and $y$ be the number of senior directors.

Considering the above conditions, we can write the following inequalities:

  The point $(0,7)$ does not satisfy the equation of the line.
  The point $(1,7)$ does not satisfy the equation of the line.
  The point $(7,7)$ does not satisfy the equation of the line.

  The line passes through the origin $(0,0)$ and has a slope of $\frac{1}{7}$.
  The slope-intercept form of a line is given by $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  Since the line passes through the origin, the y-intercept is 0.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we substitute the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and check if the equation is true.
  For point A: $(0,7)$, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 0 = 0 \neq 7$, so point A does not lie on the line.
  For point B: $(1,7)$, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7}$, so point B does not lie on the line.
  For point C: $(7,7)$, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 = 1$, so point C lies on the line.
  For point D: $(14,2)$, $y = \frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 = 2$, so point D does not lie on the line.

  P(X) = 100/200 = 1/2, and P(Y) = 1/2.

  The common denominator of $\frac{1}{x+2}$ and $\frac{1}{x+3}$ is $(x+2)(x+3)$.
  We can then rewrite the expression as follows:
  $\frac{1}{\frac{(x+3)+(x+2)}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  $=\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  $=\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$
  $=\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$

  We can simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator of the fraction by the reciprocal of the denominator.

  The process that resynthesizes ATP rapidly for exercising muscles is called anaerobic metabolism as it does not use oxygen.
  Glycolysis and glycogenolysis are two pathways that are involved in the breakdown of glucose to produce ATP.
  However, glycolysis occurs in the cytosol of cells, whereas glycogenolysis occurs in the liver and muscles.
  The TCA cycle, on the other hand, is a metabolic pathway that occurs in the mitochondria of cells, which is a slower process of energy production.
  Phosphocreatine is a high-energy compound that is stored in the muscles and used to resynthesize ATP quickly during high-intensity exercise.

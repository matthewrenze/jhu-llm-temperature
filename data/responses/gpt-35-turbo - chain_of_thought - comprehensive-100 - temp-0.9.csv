  Let the height of the room be '2x' and semi-perimeter be '5y'
  Then, the dimensions of the room are '2x * y' and '2(2x+y)'
  The area of the room is (2x * y) * (2(2x+y)) and the cost of papering it is given by Rs.260
  The area of doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m
  We can form two equations using these two pieces of information
  Solving these two equations gives the value of x, which gives us the height of the room.
  Calculations are as follows:
  
  Let z = 2x*y and t = 2(2x+y)
  Area of the room = z*t
  Cost of papering = (z + 1.5)* (2t/0.5) * 2
  (Adding 1.5 because the doors and windows occupy an area of 15 sq.m, and dividing by 0.5 to convert meters to cm)
  
  Given: z/t = 2/5 and (z+1.5)*(4t) = 26000
  Solving these equations gives us t=440 and z = 176.
  Substituting z = 2x*y, we get y=22 and x=2.2
  Hence the height of the room = 2x = 4.4m
  
  Therefore, the answer is E: 4.4m

- Let's assume that the height of the room is ""2x"" and the semi-perimeter is ""5y"".
- Then, the perimeter of the room would be ""2*(2x) + 2*(5y) = 4x + 10y"".
- As per the problem statement, the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, we can write:
  ```
  2x/5y = 2/5
  => 2x = 2y
  => x = y
  ```
- So, the perimeter is 4x + 10y = 14x.
- Let's find the dimensions of the room:
  - Let 2x = height = h.
  - Then, the breadth and length of the room are ((14x - 2x)/2)/2 and ((14x - 2x)/2)/2 respectively.
  - Simplifying, we get breadth = length = (6x)/2 = 3x.
  - Therefore, the dimensions of the room are h x 3x x 3x.
- The cost of papering the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs. 2 per meter is Rs. 260.
- Area to be covered on the walls (excluding doors and windows) = perimeter * height.
- Area to be covered on the walls (excluding doors and windows) = 14x * 2x = 28x^2.
- Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m.
- Total area to be covered on the walls (including doors and windows) = 28x^2 + 15 sq.m.
- Cost of papering the room = cost per unit area * total area to be covered.
- Cost per unit area = cost of 1 meter of paper of width 50 cm = Rs. 2/2 = Rs. 1 per meter.
- Total area to be covered = (28x^2 + 15) sq.m = (14x * 2x + 15) sq.m.
- Therefore, cost of papering = 1 * (14x * 2x + 15) * 100 = 1400x^2 + 1500.
- Solving the equation 1400x^2 + 1500 = 260, we get x^2 = 1/14.
- Therefore, x = 1/(2√14).
- Hence, the height of the room = 2x = 2/√14.

 Let H be the height of the room, and 2s be the semi-perimeter of the room.
 Therefore, H:2s = 2:5 => 5H = 2(2s) => 5H = 4s => s = (5/4)H
 Let C be the cost of covering the walls.
 Total wall area = semi-perimeter x height = 2sH
 Area covered by doors and windows = 15sq.m
 Net area to be covered = Total wall area - Area covered by doors and windows
                                 = 2sH - 15

 Cost of covering the net area = (cost per meter x area x width)/100
                                          = (2 x (2sH-15) x 0.5)/100 = (sH-7.5)/10
                                          = [(5/4)H x H - 7.5]/10
                                          = (5H^2 - 30H)/40
                                          = (H/8) x (5H-30)
 C = (H/8) x (5H-30)
 C = 260
 On solving both the equations C = 260 and H:2s = 2:5, we get H = 3.9 m

  We know that the height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  Let's assume the height is 2x and semi-perimeter is 5x.
  We know that the cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs. 260
  The price of paper is Rs. 2 per meter, and the width of the paper is 50 cm or 0.5 m.
  We have to find the height of the room.
  We can calculate the area of the four walls as 2hx(2s) = 4hs sq.m, where s = semi-perimeter and h = height.
  Also, we know that the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq. m.
  The total area that needs to be papered is (4hs - 15) sq. m.
  We can calculate the length of paper required as (4hs - 15)/0.5.
  We know that the cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260, which is equal to the length of paper required multiplied by Rs. 2.
  Therefore, (4hs - 15)/0.5 * 2 = 260.

  Let H be the height of the room and P be the semi-perimeter (half of the perimeter) of the room.
  We know that H:P = 2:5.
  Therefore, we can express H in terms of P as H = (2/5)P.
  Let L be the length of the room and W be the width of the room.
  We know that the area of the four walls of the room is LW + 2LH = LW + 2L(2/5)P = LW + (4/5)LP.
  We also know that the cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs.260 and the paper is 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter, allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.
  Let A be the total area of the four walls of the room.
  Then A = LW + (4/5)LP - 15.
  We can solve for L in terms of A and P: L = (A - (4/5)HP + 15)/W.
  We know that the cost of papering the walls of the room is Rs.260, so we can set up the equation: 260 = (A - (4/5)HP + 15)(2/W).
  We only need to find H, which will allow us to calculate all the other variables.
  
Calculation: 
  From H:P = 2:5, we know that H = (2/5)P.
  We can substitute this into the expression for the area A: A = LW + (4/5)LP - 15 = LW + (4/5)(L+H)P - 15.
  We are also given that W = 0.5m.
  From 260 = (A - (4/5)HP + 15)(2/W), we can substitute for A and L to get: 260 = (W(H + (4/5)P) - 15)((2/W)) = 2(H + (4/5)P) - 0.3.
  Solving for P, we get P = 25H/6.
  Substituting this into H:P = 2:5, we get H = 10.

  Let's first calculate the dimensions of the room using the information provided.
  Let's assume the height of the room is '2x' and the semi-perimeter is '5y'.
  The perimeter of the room will be '2(5y) = 10y'.
  Therefore, the length of the room will be '(10y - 2x)/2 = 5y - x'
  The area to be papered will be '2x(5y - x) = 10xy - 2x^2'
  The area of doors and windows is given to be 15 sq.m.
  Area of walls to be papered will be '10xy - 2x^2 - 15'
  Total cost = area to be papered * cost per meter = (10xy - 2x^2 - 15) * 2
  We need to solve this equation for 'x' to find the height of the room.
  On simplifying this equation, we will get a quadratic equation of the form 'ax^2 + bx + c = 0'

  Let the height of the room be 2x.
  Let the semi-perimeter be 2s.
  Then, the perimeter of the room is 4s.
  Since height to semi-perimeter is 2:5, we can write:
  2x:s = 2:5
  Cross-multiplying this gives: 5*2x = 2*s => 10x = 2s => s = 5x
  Let the length and breadth of the room be l and b respectively.
  Then, 2s = 2(l+b) = 10x => l+b = 5x
  The area of the four walls is given by:
  Area of four walls = Perimeter * Height
                     = 4s * 2x
                     = 8sx
  We are given that it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.
  The cost of papering the walls is the cost of papering the area of four walls plus the cost of papering the doors and windows.
  The area of four walls is 8sx, which is equal to the area of the paper used.
  The length of the paper used is the perimeter of the room, which is 4s, and the width is 0.5m.
  So, the area of the paper used is 4s * 0.5 = 2s = 10x
  The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m, and the total area of the doors and windows is lb, so we have:
  lb = 15
  We know that l+b = 5x, so we can solve for l and b:
  l = 5x-b
  Substituting in lb = 15, we get:
  (5x-b)*b = 15
  Simplifying, we get:
  b^2 - 5xb + 15 = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get:
  b = (5x ± sqrt(25x^2 - 4*15))/2
  We can discard the negative value, and simplify the expression as:
  b = (5x + sqrt(25x^2 - 60))/2
  Now, we can substitute l and b in the expression for the area of the four walls to get:
  8sx = (l+b)*2x*2 + lb = (5x)*2x*2 + (5x + sqrt(25x^2 - 60))/2 * (5x - sqrt(25x^2 - 60))/2
  Simplifying, we get:
  8sx = 20x^2 + (25x^2 - 60)/4
  Solving for x, we get:
  x = sqrt(15)/2
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = sqrt(15).

  It is given that cost of papering the wall is Rs. 260
  Let length of the room be L, then area of 4 walls = P*2x = 10x*2x
  The area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m
  The area of the wallpaper is the area of the walls - area of doors/windows
  Given that the wallpaper is 50cm wide and costs Rs. 2 per meter, so the cost will be Rs. 1 per 50/100 meters = Rs. 0.02 per meter.
  Let the length of wallpaper required to cover the wall be L1.
  Then L1 * 0.5 = Area of walls - Area of doors/windows
  L1  = (20x*2x - 15)/0.5 = 80x^2 - 30
  Cost of the wallpaper = L1 * 0.02 = 0.02 * (80x^2 - 30)

40% of the employees take a winter vacation and a summer vacation, so 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations. 
20% of the employees take neither, so 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacation. 

Q percent of the employees take summer vacation but not winter vacation. So it means that Q percent of the employees took a summer vacation, but they didn't take a winter vacation and we want to find the value of Q.

Let's calculate the number of employees who took at least one vacation (winter or summer or both):
75 employees took winter vacation + (Q% x 100 employees who took summer vacation but not winter vacation) + 40 employees took both vacations.

Therefore, the total number of employees who took at least one vacation is: 
75 + (Q% x 100) + 40 = 100 - 20 (those who did not take any)

Solving for Q, we get:
Q% = 15

Therefore, 15% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

  Let N be the total number of employees in the company.
  If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, then 100% - 75% = 25% do not take a winter vacation.
  If 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, then 40% is the overlap between those who take winter vacation and those who take summer vacation.
  Therefore, 75% - 40% = 35% takes only winter vacation but not summer vacation.
  If 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then 100% - 20% = 80% of the employees take at least one vacation.
  Therefore, the percentage of employees who take at least a summer vacation is 80%.

Let's assume that a total of 100 employees work in the company.
If 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, that means that 75 employees take a winter vacation. 
And, 25 employees do not take a winter vacation.
If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, that means that 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations. 
Our goal is to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation, but not a winter vacation.
20% of the employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. So, 80% of employees take at least one of these vacations.
Let X percent of the employees take only a summer vacation.
Then, the percentage of employees taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:
X - 40
We know that 75 employees take a winter vacation, so 25 employees take only a winter vacation.
Also, we know that 20% take neither vacation, so 80% take at least one vacation.
Hence, (25 + 40 + X)% = 100% - 20% = 80%

  Therefore, the total amount she would get is 20x + 25y cents.
  From the question, we also know that the total amount she got after one dive is $3.40 or 340 cents.
  So we can write the equation 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies the above equation.
  To do this, we can start by assuming the number of brass coins she brought, find the corresponding value of x using the equation, and check which value of x gives us an integer solution.
  If we assume y = 0, then the equation becomes 20x = 340, which gives x = 17 (an integer solution).
  If we assume y = 1, then the equation becomes 20x + 25 = 340, which gives x = 16 (an integer solution).
  If we assume y = 2, then the equation becomes 20x + 50 = 340, which gives x = 14.5 (not an integer solution).
  If we assume y = 3, then the equation becomes 20x + 75 = 340, which gives x = 13.25 (not an integer solution).

  Let's assume that the diver brought x number of copper coins.
  Let's assume that the diver brought y number of brass coins.
  From the problem statement, we can create a system of two equations:
  1. 20x + 25y = 340    (total value of coins brought up)
  2. x + y = total number of coins brought up
  
  We need to find the value of x that satisfies the above system of equations and is a minimum.
  
  To solve, let's solve equation 2 for y:
  y = total number of coins - x
  Substituting this in equation 1, we have:
  20x + 25(total number of coins - x) = 340
  20x + 25total number of coins - 25x = 340
  -5x + 25(total number of coins) = 340
  -5x = 340 - 25(total number of coins)
  5x = 25(total number of coins) - 340
  x = 5(total number of coins) - 68
  
  We know that x is a whole number since the problem deals with counting coins.
  Since 5(total number of coins) - 68 must be minimum, the value of total number of coins should be maximum (to minimize x).
  The maximum value of total number of coins that makes x a whole number is 16 (for total number of coins = 17). 
  
  Substituting the value of total number of coins = 17 in the above equation gives us
  x = 5(17) - 68 = -3
  
  We made an error somewhere since x cannot be negative.
  Let's try the same equation for total number of coins = 18.
  x = 5(18) - 68 = 2

  The ratio of the original length of the ribbon to the reduced length is 5:3.
  This means for every 5 parts of the original ribbon, there are 3 parts left.
  We can represent this as 5x:3x where x is the common factor.
  The sum of the ratio parts is 5x + 3x = 8x which means 8 parts represent the total length of the ribbon.
  The ratio of the original length to the reduced length is 5:3 which means the reduced length is 3/5 times the original length.

  We can first try to determine which singer each accompanist has accompanied.
  Since each accompanist has accompanied two singers and there are only 6 singers, there must be an accompanist who has not yet accompanied any of the singers. Let's call this accompanist Z.
  From condition (1), if X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment. Therefore, W has not accompanied F.
  From condition (3), either X or Y is H accompaniment. Therefore, Z has not accompanied H.
  From condition (4), F and G do not share accompaniment and L and K do not share accompaniment. Therefore, W must have accompanied either F or G and X must have accompanied either L or K.
  From condition (4), H and M do not share accompaniment. Therefore, Z must have accompanied either H or M.
  Now, let's consider the choices.
  A: G and H have not been paired yet. Therefore, this cannot be the pair that Y cannot accompany.
  B: L and H have not been paired yet. Therefore, this cannot be the pair that Y cannot accompany.
  C: F and L have been paired. If W has accompanied F, then Y must have accompanied L. If X has accompanied L, then Z must have accompanied K. This leaves G and M as the pair that Y cannot accompany. Therefore, this could be the pair that Y cannot accompany.
  D: F and M have been paired. If W has accompanied F, then X must have accompanied M. If X has not accompanied G, then Y must have accompanied G. This leaves K and H as the pair that Y cannot accompany. Therefore, this could be the pair that Y cannot accompany.

  There are now three possibilities for H and M accompaniments: (a) H is an X accompaniment and M is a Y accompaniment, (b) H is a Y accompaniment and M is an X accompaniment, or (c) H and M are both W accompaniments.
  From condition (4), H and M do not share accompaniment. Therefore, case (c) is impossible. In case (a), Y must be an M accompaniment, so it contradicts condition (3). Therefore, case (b) is the only possibility.

To weaken Li Ming's argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that unemployed people can increase their consumption and buy non-necessity goods during the period of lowest prices.
Option A speaks of an improving economic situation in the future but doesn't address the current period of lowest prices and unemployment.
Option B doesn't address the consuming ability of unemployed people.
Option C states that unemployed people must continue buying necessities but doesn't address their capacity to buy non-necessity items.
Option D provides a rationale for unemployed people to compress expenditures during the period of economic deterioration so that they can have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point. Therefore, Option D weakens Li Ming's argument.

  Li Ming argues that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  We need an answer that can weaken his argument by showing that falling prices to the lowest point can lead to economic improvement.
  Option A talks about an increase in demand after the economic situation improves and people have jobs. This answer does not address the current situation when the economy is deteriorating, so it cannot weaken Li Ming's argument.
  Option B is not related to the current situation and does not address Li Ming's argument.
  Option C is incorrect because Li Ming himself stated that people will buy necessities, so it does not weaken his argument.
  Option D is the best choice because it weakens Li Ming's argument by showing that even unemployed people can save money during an economic downturn and use their savings to consume when prices fall to the lowest point. This increased consumption can lead to an improvement in economic conditions.

Li Ming argues that if people are unemployed, falling prices will not lead to economic improvement because they will not be able to increase consumption and buy products other than necessities. We need to find a statement that weakens this argument.
Option A discusses how employees will buy products after they have been reemployed. However, it is not enough to weaken Li Ming's argument.
Option B discusses the attitude of the consumers towards a deteriorating economy, which is irrelevant to the argument between Zhang Qiang and Li Ming.
Option C discusses how even the unemployed need to buy necessities. However, it does not address whether they will increase consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.
Option D discusses how even unemployed people will compress their expenditures during the period of economic deterioration. This statement suggests that people will turn to savings and reduce expenses during economic deterioration. and as a result, they will have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point, which weakens Li Ming's argument.

To weaken this argument, we need to show that unemployed people can still increase their consumption during a recession despite not having a job.
Option A may support this by saying that many people who are reemployed will buy the goods delayed when the economy improves. However, this option does not provide evidence that unemployed people will increase their consumption during the recession.
Option B does not provide any new information related to our argument.
Option C provides the opposite idea that unemployed people must continue to buy necessities such as food, which strengthens Li Ming's argument.
Option D shows that unemployed people will compress their expenses during the period of economic deterioration, but it also says that they will have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.

    Udall and Stuckey work in the same zone (Option 2)
    Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2 (but not both) (Option 3)
    Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1 (but not both) (Option 4)
    There are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 (Option 5)
  Since Quinn and Parra are working in the same zone, they must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, let's assume that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 3.
  So, we have four people left to assign to Zone 2 and Zone 1.
  Since either Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2 (but not both), we can assume that Udall is in Zone 3 since he is already assigned to a zone.
  Therefore, we can assume that Tiao is in Zone 2, leaving Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to be assigned to Zone 1.

  Among the remaining photographers, we have only one photographer who has not been assigned to any ceremony: Knutson.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This is not feasible since there is only one photographer left (Knutson), who cannot be assigned to the both ceremonies.

  Let's see what we know:
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil painting in the lower position.
  - Wall 3 has Franz's oil painting.
  - Wall 2 has Isaacs's watercolor painting.
  - Since each student has one oil and one watercolor painting, the student whose oil painting is on Wall 3 cannot also have their watercolor. So Franz's watercolor cannot be on Wall 3.
  - We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Franz's oil is on Wall 3, then Greene's watercolor painting is on Wall 3 in the upper position.
  - Therefore, Hidalgo's and Greene's oil paintings must be on Walls 1 and 4 in some order. However, we don't know which painting will be on which wall.
  - We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo and Greene must have one oil and one watercolor painting on their walls.
  - We know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Since we have Isaacs's oil at Wall 4, we cannot have Isaacs's other painting on Wall 1. Thus, we must have Franz's watercolor on Wall 1.
  - Therefore, the answer is A: Franz's watercolor.

  This means that Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 3.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed on the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Isaacs cannot have any painting displayed on wall 3.
  Since no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, we know that either Hidalgo or Greene must have a painting displayed on wall 3.
  We are also given that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be on wall 3, since we know that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.

  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the guitar solo can only be the first, second or third.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We can deduce that the violinist will play before the keyboard and after the percussion, and that the saxophonist will play after the percussion or the trumpet.
  If the guitarist plays third, then the keyboard will play either second or fourth. If the keyboard player plays second, then from deduction the saxophonist will play fourth. If the keyboard plays fourth, then the violinist will play third, so the saxophonist cannot play third.

To find who CANNOT perform the third solo, we must first find out who HAS to perform the third solo, based on the given restrictions.
- The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so he/she must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist must perform one of the first three solos.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist must perform one of the last three solos.
- The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist does. This means there are only two possible positions for the keyboard player's solo: third or fourth. 

Now, let's find out who cannot perform the third solo:
- If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then either the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform the second solo. But if the percussionist performs the second solo, then the keyboard player will not have a possible position for their solo (since there are only two possible positions, after the violinist and before the guitarist). Therefore, the saxophonist CANNOT perform the third solo.
- The remaining members who have not yet been assigned a solo are the trumpeter and violinist. Neither of them has any restrictions that could prevent them from being assigned the third solo. Therefore, they BOTH could perform the third solo.

  From the given conditions, the only member left is the guitarist who does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist performs the sixth solo.
  Now that we have determined who will perform the solos, we can determine who cannot perform the third solo. Since the keyboard player performs the third solo, then the answer is either A, C, D, or E.
  From the given conditions, the saxophonist can perform the solo after the percussionist or after the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the solo as the fifth or sixth solo. So, the answer cannot be C.

  Therefore, Udall must be in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so Stuckey is also in Zone 3.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and neither of them works in Zone 3, which means they both work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Also, there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there are at least two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Then, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are the remaining sales representatives.
  Both Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3, so there are at least two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Tiao also works in Zone 3, then there will be exactly two sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition ""There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2."".
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, Mahr must work in Zone 2, which contradicts the condition that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.

From the context, we know that the museum displays only twentieth-century works.
Prints of all of the latter (meaning the twentieth-century works) are available in the museum store.
The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
Therefore, it is clear that
Not every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection.
Every print that is sold in the museum store is not necessarily a copy of a twentieth-century work since the store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
We cannot infer that there are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
We cannot infer that Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector.
We also cannot infer whether or not Hopper's Nighthawks is displayed in the museum.

  The reasoning in the argument suggests that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, imposing a severe penalty cannot be justified.
  The principle that supports this reasoning is one that links the severity of the penalty to the degree of certainty required to impose the penalty on an individual.
  The principle that best reflects this link is A, which states that ""The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.""

  To find the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument, we need to find an answer that casts doubt on the conclusion that magnetic fields are effective at relieving back pain or on the causality relationship between using magnets and reducing pain.
  Answer choice A suggests that the patients' knowledge of receiving treatment may have affected the results, and may have led to a placebo effect, making the magnets seem more effective than they actually are. This answer choice directly attacks the causality relationship between using magnets and reducing pain.
  Answer choice B discusses physicians' opinions, which do not necessarily reflect the truth. This answer choice is not relevant to the conclusion drawn in the physician's argument.

Choice (C) says that people who harbor M. tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, unlike H. pylori, which allegedly strengthens the immune response and benefits a host.

  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument since it talks about treating the diseases caused by both bacteria, not their classification as commensals.
  Choice B's claim about the duration of the diseases caused by the bacteria is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice C can potentially undermine the argument since benefits are one of the criteria for considering bacteria as commensals. If we show that people who harbor M tuberculosis don't derive any benefits, this would make the comparison between the two bacteria less relevant.

The passage explains that the use of neuroimaging in psychology is a fundamentally different kind of enterprise as it depends on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, which may not be necessarily true. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) subtractive method is used to create maps of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and depictions of metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and gives a false impression of neat functional localization.

- The passage argues against the validity of the modular theory of the mind.
- FMRI produces maps of metabolic activity that are based on a subtractive method.
- The subtractive method subtracts a baseline measurement from a cognitive task measurement.
- The resulting differential rate of oxygen use is believed to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
- The entirety of the brain remains active in both conditions; the subtractive method obscures this.

The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and its limitations.
Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) is a method used in cognitive tasks.
FMRI produces images by following a subtraction technique, which allows cognitive tasks to light up certain parts of the brain.
The modular theory of mind is questioned and refuted in the passage.
There is a difference between medical diagnosis and neuroimaging in psychology.

  - The critique of the modular theory of mind premise, which suggests that mental activity might not be decomposable into independent modules and that various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  - The use of functional MRI, which subtracts out all the distributed brain functions, giving a false impression of neat functional localization.
  
  The passage does not support A or B.

The Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of their age, by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be better carried on.

  The researchers observed that certain woodpecker finches developed a novel tool-using technique.
  The new technique involved the use of the beak to lever the prey to within reach.
  This technique seemed to develop from within the individual birds.
  The researchers noted that the use of this technique was a deviation from the typical tool-using behavior.
  Additionally, the researchers observed that the technique was difficult to observe and acquire socially.
  Therefore, the conclusion that individual learning was responsible for this technique is supported by the fact that the technique was different from typical tool-using behavior and difficult to observe and acquire socially.

  The passage discusses six lab and field studies that explore the effects of having a large, dominant competitor. The studies found that highlighting a large competitor’s size and close proximity can help smaller brands. In a field study, they conducted in an independent bookstore, shoppers were given a $5 coupon, coded with the in-store ad version they read. Analyzing shoppers’ sales receipts and the number of redeemed coupons, they found that shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase after reading the “large competitors” version of the in-store ad, compared to the “small competitors” version or the “no competition” version. Therefore, the studies suggest that if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

  The passage discusses several studies that suggest highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them. 
  It is suggested that framing the competitive game and emphasizing a competitive narrative against a larger company can help a small establishment and spur consumers to make a purchase that supports the smaller competitor.
  The ""framing-the-game"" effect has been tested in various contexts and product categories, and support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

  Scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
  The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
  Therefore, the likely reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study is because they were part of an existing project to reintroduce the species to Europe and were hand-raised so could be more easily tracked and observed.

  The DBA plans to increase its membership by a total of $n$ businesses per year.
  The number of businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year is $b$.
  The relationship between the total number of businesses $y$ and the number of years $x$ from now should be linear since the DBA plans to increase its membership by a total of $n$ businesses per year.
  The slope of the line is the rate of change of the number of businesses per year, which is $n$; the $y$-intercept is $b$ since there were $b$ businesses in the DBA at the beginning of this year.
  Therefore, the function that best models the total number of businesses, $y$, the DBA plans to have as members $x$ years from now is $y=n x+b$.

  Malocclusion is a misalignment or incorrect relation between the teeth of the two dental arches, i.e., the upper arch (maxillary) and the lower arch (mandibular).
  Classes I, II, and III describe malocclusion based on the relative position of the maxillary first molar to the mandibular first molar.
  Class I malocclusion occurs when the teeth are aligned properly, but the bite is not.
  Class II malocclusion, or retrognathism, occurs when the maxilla is too far forward (overdeveloped) or the mandible is too far back (underdeveloped).

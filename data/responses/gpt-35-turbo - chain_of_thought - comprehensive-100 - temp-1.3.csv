Based on the problem statement:
  The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5x.
  Given, The area of the doors and windows = 15 sq metre.
  Area to be covered by a wallpaper = total area - area used by doors and windows.
  By perimeter formula, Perimeter = 2(length + breath)
  On given 2(length + breath) = 5x;
                   length + breath = (5/2)x;
                   area = length*breath= x²(5/2 -x/2)=5x²/4-x³/4
Formula to calculate total cost = area covered x cost of paper per square metre
  
Now solving for ""x"":
Since, AB +BC+CD+DA = perimeter of the room = 2(length + width) = 5x;
Therefore length + breath = (5/2)x;
By using pythagorean theorem, we can make (OA) true i.e. 
EF^2 = CG^2 - FC^2 where CG = reqd length (56.82); FC = width ( Hall is made from legs deploying??)
At a cost of Rs. 2 per m, the cost of 1 metre wide paper would be charged 2 times of its length. So ckost for papering will be  2X.(56+64+(hall and window area)) at a cost Rs 260

Finally we calculate *x' which was height:

  Let's assign variables to some quantities within the problem.
    The height of the room will be ""2x"" where x is some constant.
    The semi-perimeter of the room will be the sum of the length and the breadth of the room divided by 2; if we assume that the length is ""l"" and the breadth is ""b"", then (l+b)/2 is the required quantity.
  Now we can use the ratio given i.e. 2:5 and then solve for x.
  After that, it should be possible to compute the area of the walls in terms of ""l"" and ""b"", and we can use the given information on the cost of paper to set up another equation which we can use to find the values of ""l,"" ""b,"" and hence ""2x."".
  Eventually, we can compare our value of ""2x"" in the derived equations with the given options to determine our answer.

  Let h be the height of the room, and let S be its semi-perimeter (sum of all sides divided by 2).
  Let w be the width of the room.
  The question states h:S=2:5.
  Let 2x and 5x be the value of h and S respectively, so we have h = 2x and S = 5x.
  We need to find the height of the room.

  Let's calculate the length of each side(in meters).
  Let L1, L2, L3, and L4 be the respective length values for each wall with no windows and doors.
  S = L1 + L2 + L3 + L4
  S = 2L1 + 2w
  5x = 2L1 + 2w
  L1 + w = 2.5x                     (a)

  The total wall area to be covered is (L1 + w)h + (L2 + w)h + L3h + L4h   = S*h
  Neglecting door and window:
  (L1 + L2 + L3 + L4)h = 5x.2x
  Simplifying we get L1+L2+L3+L4 = 10x/2 = 5x
  L1 = (5x-w)/3                  (b)
  
  Now we know the values of (a) and (b).
  Multiplying (a) by 3 and adding (b) into it we get:

   3L1 + 3w + 3w/5 - 2w = 5x-w
  15L1 = 24x/5
  L1 = 24x/5 * 3/15 = 144x/75

  Now w=L1/2 = 72x/75

  The Area of four walls is 2h (L1 + w) = S*h where S = 5x, h = 2x.Let area= W.

  Wrapping area is given by: a=w*L   
  cost given 2per meter and width=0.5m , so in 1 sq meter paper need 4 meters(it covers (2+0.5)=2.5 width in 1 meter length). Therefore to cover the total area transient into meter *4 should be done.

  Let's start by identifying the formula for the semi-perimeter 's' of a rectangular room:
      s = 1/2 x (l + b), where l is length, b is breadth 
  Let the height of the room be 2x, then the length and breadth can be expressed as:
      Length = 5x, and Breadth = 2.5x
  The cost of papering the walls of the room of area 'A' is represented by the equation:
      S = cost of paper per meter x perimeter'/100 x ht + cost of labor
        where perimeter' is the perimeter minus the edges 
  Let l', b' be the width and length of the doors and windows. 
  Then A can be represented as 
      A = (lxb) - (l'xb') 
  Now , let's insert the known values into these equations

Sol:I will first find the wall area excluding the doors and windows. Semi-perimeter of the room can be calculated as [(circumference of the room) divided by 2], 
     and it can be written in terms of height 'H' and width 'W' of the room.
         Semi-perimeter=[2W + 2H]/2
         Semi-perimeter= W + H        ...(1)
      It is given that height to semi-perimeter=2:5.
            H/(W+H) = 2/5         ....(2)
            W+H =(5/2)*H          
            Substitute equation 1 in equation 2           
            H/[ (5/2)*H] = 2/5           
            H= height of the room=  4 m
       
     I will then calcualate:
       Wall area without considering doors and windows = 2 × Semi-perimeter × Height 
          
         Wall area = 2( W + H ) × H      Substituting (1) 
                   
      From the wall area I will exclude the area of openings i.e doors and windows which is given as 15sp.m        
        Wall Area - Area of doors and windows 
                                       = 2 ( W + H) × H  - 15m^2 
               Area of doors and windows = 15 m^2
               
     From the above we hire our requirement to paper the room multiply the perimeter with the height of the room,         
        Papering cost (100 m^2)= Wall Area – Area of doors and windows
                                                                       = [2 ( W + H) × H] - 15m^2  
                      
I will the Converting from cost per square meter of papering to cost for thickness of $0.005\text{m}$    buy the given paper,

 thus cost of paper for 100 sq.m = (260/100)[$2+(\frac{0.5}{100})$] 

Now finally to find the Wall covered == all walls i.e  (2 x Length x Breadth)+  Height x perimter , wiht all given, we can caliactye the  height of the wall 

 Solution: 
 For room height(H) to finite Perimeter = 2:5, H= 4m
 Wall area = ( 2W + 2H)H = 2W*H + 2H^2
               OR
              Wall area = 2( W + H ) × H     
 Let the breadth(W) be ‘b’
 From perimeter relation, we know that; 
                      2H+W =(5/2)*H                
                                       H = 4
                
Replacement values:
Wall area = 2bH + 2H^2=2b×4 + 2×(4)^2 = 16b +32
Recall cliheycount after counting=open count-cover= 
therefore covered area = Wall Area - Area of doors and widows = (16 x b + 32) - 15           (area of doors n wiknows)
Finally, length of the room = 2Covered area/ height -4Perimter = 2 x [(16 x b + 32) - 15]/4-[(2 x b) + (2 x 4)]= 8(3b−1)/ 6b-4
Now if sproofread it `simplify and rearrange  We will getrippling height to be= 16/[ 3(b-1)]

If there are the equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins, and 1 rupee coins and we are interested in finding out how many of each are there -------
If we assume that the number of each type of coin is ""x"", then we can set up the following equation:
Number of coins of 25paise is Rs.(x*0.25)
Number of coins of 50paise is Rs.(x*0.5)
Number of coins of rupee is Rs.(x*1)
The sum of the value of all these coins available would be Worth = Rs.[(x*0.25)+(x*0.50)+(x*1)]
x being the unknown variable(rbq) because we do not know how many coins of each there are
The sum worth of all the coins should be equal to the value of my money pouch RM worth Rs.700.
NOW Trading 700/Rs.[(x*0.25)+(x*0.50)+(x*1)] will give us the value of this unknown variable (x).
Once we have calculated x, we can substitute its value in any one of the above equations (say first or second or third) to find the actual number of coins for of any one type. Since all the three numbers we are looking for are equal, hence any equation will give us the value of the other two also.

Thus,
700/Rs. (0.25x+0.5x+1x) = x
700/Rs. 1.75x=x
x= 400

And, Then 
Number of coins of 25paise= HRESULT( 0.25*400) = 100
Number of coins of 50paise= HRESULT( 0.5*400) = 2000
Number of coins of ONE RUPEE= W(all within x is assumed akin integer so ) 400 - (100+200) = 100

  We need to find the number of each coin having given total amount and total coins.
  
  Let's assume that we X number of coins of denomination i. Therefore, total amount coming from these X coins would be equal to i * X.
  Also, given the following details:
  1. #Coins with value 0.25 = #Coins with value 0.50 = #Coins with value 1 = a
  2. #TotalCoins = TotalMoney / CoinValue and TotalMoney = Rs. 700
  3. TotalCoins, (i, X) information related to each denomination will help us derive equation, so let's form it one by one for denomination 0.25Rs., 0.50Rs. and 1Rs.
    
  Equation for denomination 0.25Rs. would be,
  0.25 * #CoinsHaving_Value_0.25Rs. = 0.25 * a * (#ngGames / 0.25) --- (i)
  Equation for denomination 0.50Rs. would be,
  0.50 * #CoinsHaving_Value_0.50Rs. = 0.50 * a * (#ngGames / 0.50) --- (ii)
  Equation for denomination 1Rs. would be,
  1.00 * #CoinsHaving_Value_1Rs. = 1.00 * b * (#ngGames / 1.00) --- (iii)
    
  Adding all three equation to form the final one:
  0.25a + 0.50a + b = 700
    
  For finding the value of total number of coin using equation (i), we get
  (#ngGames) = 0.25 * a * (#ngGames / 0.25) + 0.50 * a * (#ngGames / 0.50) +  1.00 * b * (#ngGames / 1.00) --- (iv)
     
  Also since total number of coins is '3a+b'. Therefore using equation (iv), we would have
  level action`(` `)`
  expanding previous equation would result in the following:
  (0.25 - (#ngGames / 0.25)) * a + (0.50 - (#ngGames / 0.50)) * a + (1.00 - (#ngGames / 1.00)) * b = 0 
    
­  Using a value solver on this non-linear equation will give result for a and b values.
  By-solving it we will have two feasible solution two a and b would be: (x = #Coins_Nbr)
  (a=100, b=100) and (a=50, b=300)
  Out of these only (a=100, b=100) is valid answer as it fulfill requirements expressed in the problem statement
  As Initially it is stated that, number of coin of each type(0.25Rs, 0.50Rs,1Rs) was equal to each other i.e., '3a', 
  that implies a would have been dividend of '3'. However, both a and a-b are clean multiple of 3.

    - we have ""X"" 1-rupee coins, so the total value contributed by that would be 1*X.
  As stated on the question, the total combined value of all these throughout is Rs. 700.

Therefore, there are 20 choices for the first letter and then 19 choices left for the last letter.
After the first and last letters have been chosen, there are 5 vocal letters left, and only one of these to complete our 3-letter word performance must be converted into our central vocal.
So, only 5 choices to make for the central vowel.
The remaining unselected 4 co-vowels numbers will not affect the outcome since we will be working with just a specific midd1le vocal letter for evely different pair of (Fiddle, Little) ,
there will be (20 x 19 x 5) possible choices, which would calculate to 1,900.

There are different ways to approach this question - one possible strategy to solve the problem is:

 If 300 deer were caught, tagged, and released in 2001, and assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002:
    - Those 300 deer represent some proportion of the total deer population in 2001
    - We don't know that proportion, but let 300/x be the proportion, where x is the total number of deer in the forest in 2001.
    - So, the number of deer in the forest in 2001 without tags = x - 300
    - During 2002, 500 deer were caught and examined. Only 20 of these (or 4%) had tags from the previous year.
    - If this 4% proportion is the same for the entire population, then out of x deers, a proportion of 4% should have been tagged after 2001.
    - That proportion corresponds to 20 deers that were actually caught in 2002. Therefore:
  0.04x = 20  
  x = 500

- During 2001, 300 deer were tagged. The added tags do not increase the population of the deer. So, the population with tags up 300.
- During 2002, 500 deers were caught. Of them, 20 had already tagged during 2001. So, 480 deers have no tags. Also, we have now tagged 300+20=320 in total in two years.
- We found out that the ratio of tagged deers in the second year sample to entire sample is equal to the ratio of tagged deers in the entire population. Therefore, we can say 
(20/500) = (320/P)

- We know that 75% of employees took a winter vacation and 40% of employees took both winter and summer vacation.
  So, 75% - 40% = 35% of employees took only winter vacations.
- 20% took neither summer nor winter vacations.
- Let S be the percentage of employees taking only summer vacations.
- Then, we have 100% - [ (35% only winter) + (40% both) + (S%) + (20% neither)] = 100%
- Solving the above equation for S, we get S% = 5%
- Therefore 5% of the employees took only summer vacations. Hence Q percent is 5.
- The answer is A: 5%.

  We can create a venn diagram and use algebra.
  Let X be the number of employees or 100x percent of employees in the company
  Among the 75% that take a winter vacation, 
    (100) - (40) = 60 could be taking only winter.
  So, there are 75x - 60 employees taking both types of vacations
  Of the remaining:
  There are (40-20 = ) 20 percent taking only summer
  There are 55x = 100X - [(75-40)+20] employees who didn't take a winter vacation.
Therefore Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation = (20/55) x 100 ≈ 36.36~ ≈ 35%.

   To get the percentage of employees who took only summer vacations, we have to identify the other groups since these overlaps. 
   If 75 percent of the employees take a winter vacation which can be represented by W, that means the percentage of those didn't take winter vacation represented by ~W will be 100 - 75 = 25%.
   Also, it is said that 40 percent take a winter & summer vacation represented by (W ∩ S), hence the remaining number of the population that took only winter instead of both will be (75 - 40) = 35% winter-only~.
   This also means that (100 - 35) = 65% Percent didn't take winter vacation what so ever!
   
   We know that:
     Percent who take a summer vacation = Winter rpt + summer-rpt - both-rpt - vacationless.

   <*> will drop out (substract) since it represents the percentage that took both vacations of these summer vacation takers.

  We need to use Venn diagrams and some algebra to solve this problem.
  Let's use ""W"" for winter vacation, and ""S"" for summer vacation.
  We know the following:
    - 75% of employees took a winter vacation (W'), and 25% didn't (W).
    - 40% of employees took both winter and summer vacation (W ^ S), but not all of them. We don't know the number who only took W ^ S.
    - 20% of employees (neither W nor S), or W' ^ S'.
    - We want to determine the percent of employees that take a summer vacation but didn't take a winter vacation (S' ^ W).

  Let X be the percentage of those who also took the winter vacation apart from summer vacation.

  Then, 100 = X + 25 - (40 + X) + 20 + S' + (S' ^ W) 

  Simplifying terms, we find:
  100 = -15X + 2S' + 1W'

  But we can't solve this directly without more information about the size of the population.

  However,  S' + (S' ^ W) is exactly the proportion of people who took S but not W, so that's the answer we're looking for.

 To determine the percentage of employees who take a winter Vaction, we add up the percentage of those who take no vacation (20%) and those who take both winter and summer vacations (40%), so the percentage of employees who take only a winter vacation is:
 
 Winter Vacation percentage = (100% - 20% - 40%) = 40%
 
In other words, 40% of employees take winter vacation, a total of 75% for vacation; Then:

 Percentage of employees who only take summer vacation = total summer vacation takers - WinteVacations-takers  =  Q%

 Q% = (total Saumner - Winter only - Summer & Winter - Neither) = Solo Summer Vacationers

    ""A'"" represents the complement of the group ""A"" (i.e., those who did not take a winter vacation);
	""B"" represents the number of employees who took a summer vacation;
    ""B'"" represents the complement of ""B"" (i.e., those who did not take a summer vacation);
We also know that 75% of employees take a winter vacation. Thus, 25% of employees do not take a winter vacation.

  Let's say 'T' represents the total number of employees in the company.

  Therefore, out of '0.75T' employees taking a winter vacation, we have '0.4*0.75=0.3T' employees who take winter and summer vacations.
  Among the '0.75T' employees who take a winter vacation, '0.3T' employees take a winter-summer vacation and '0.75T-0.3T=0.45T' employees take only the winter vacation.
  If 20 percent of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, then the total percentage of employees who take either vacation is (100-20) = 80.

Let c be the number of copper and b be the number of brass coins she brought. 
Given that:
- The coin-diver gets 20 cents for bringing each copper coin, which means c number of copper coins she dug give her $0.20 for each coin.
- Similarly, she gets 25 cents for each brass coin, which means b number of brass coins she dug give her $0.25 for each coin.
- She got $3.40 for all the work, which can be mathematically represented as (0.2*c +0.25*b)$ = $3.40.

We can solve the above equation to determine c, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought. 
After calculation, we get:
c = (0.008b + 17)
We know that, at least, she brought one brass coin because 25 is not a multiple of 20. The next smallest even multiple 0f 20 is 40, i.e 40 cents = 20 (two copper coins) + 20 (for each coin-diving operation).
Therefore, 340c = 20x(number of copper coins) + 25(number of brass coins) + 20(number of operations divisible by 2).

  Let C be the number of copper coins, and B be the number of brass coins.

  For each copper coin, 20 cents are earned. 
  For each brass coin, 25 cents are earned. 
  They got $3.40, which equals to 340 cents.
  To find out a combination of C and B of the minimum number, we can use guess and check method.
  First, suppose she brought only copper, 
    In that case, she would have got 20 cents, but another swim to get the remaining$.80 is not possible because she got to spend 20 cents on gas to return from the river which leaves her with only $3.20.
  On second guess, if she brought 1 brass coin, 
    Then she effectively got only (25-20)=5 cents more for the ticket to handle half copper and half brass. 
    Or soon note if she brought only 2 or 1 copper coin, it equals or less than 340-25=315 [For two] or 295 [For one]. 
    Hence rule out the possibility of only one brass and separates other feasible combinations as mentioned below. 
   Therefore, she must have brought two copper coins.

Let:
  C = the number of copper coins the coin-diver brought,

  20C + 25B = 340 cents ...equation 1
  C + B = n, where n = minimum number of coins, formula for total number of coins.
    C + B = n ...equation 2

If C is at its minimum, then what should be the value of B?
To get the minimum number of copper coins, we need to have the maximum number of brass coins.

Solve equation 2 for B
  B = n - C ...equation 3
Substitute the equation 3 to equation 1
  20C + 25(n - C)  = 340 cents
  -5C + 25n = 340 cents

So, we can simplify the ratio by dividing both numbers by the greatest common factor between them.
The greatest common factor of 5 and 3 is 1.
Dividing by 1 gives us 5:3 again.
Now we can use this simplified ratio to find the new length of the ribbon.
Applying this ratio, the new length of the ribbon is:
(3/5) x 30 = 18 cm

  The original length of the ribbon is 30 cm.
  Suppose the original length after it was reduced is w cm
  The ratio of the new length to the old length is 5:3.
  This means (new length)/(old length) = 5/3
  Using cross-multiplication, we have: new length = (5/3)*old length
  Plugging in old length = 30 cm, we have new length = (5/3)*30 = 50 cm.
  Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 50 cm.

  The ribbon was reduced in the ratio 5 : 3.
  The length of the ribbon was originally 30cm.
  The total ratio is 5 + 3 = 8 parts.
  Each part is 30 / 8 = 3.75cm.
  The ribbon was reduced to 5 parts out of 8 parts.

    Consider possible affairs for each:
    If FX/FH, then because F and G do not share accompaniments, Y can accompany M and L without contradiction to the conditions.
    If the accompaniments are YH/YL, then terms 2 and 4 contradict, rejecting this configuration.
     
    Therefore one set of properly configured accompaniments is FX/FH (i.e., X accompanies F and H; W accompanies G and L; and Y accompanies M and K).
    According to this possibility, Y accompanies M and K where both Carly R and HGF belong to another accompaniment, so neither F and M nor L and K share any accompaniments.

  B: If Y accompanies L, based on condition 2, X cannot accompany F, G or K leaving only H and M as options for accompaniment. However, K cannot be accompanied by a partner of L (condition 4) which would leave no available accompaniment for K, so it's impossible.
  C: If Y accompanies F this means X must also perform with H since this fulfills one-uphemistically portion of condition 3. This means the partner accompanying L is W but based on condition 1; then X is not F's accompaniment. Thus, it’s impossible.
  D: If Y accompanies F then this leaves only G to be paired with H since M is already paired with X. Hence, X is K's piano accompanist. For L, there's only one possibility of accompaniment left i.e. W.This fulfills all conditions hence L belongs with W.

  In the former case where F accompanies Y, L cannot be Y's accompaniment because in this situation, W will have to associate with M as a result the only remaining piano accompaniment (Y) Ferdinand will be left with, can not accompany L.

Option C directly opposes the mandate suggested in Li Ming's belief, which states that, despite everything else, no neglected expenses are noted by many whilst unemployed. It rejects the existence of money for a nearly necessary item, formulated on a false account. 
Option D supports the notion that unemployed people must compress expenses, which shows specific financial planning- ultimately suggesting ways to sustain financially while facing financial turmoil.

  A: If F and H are with the final trio, either of them has to perform consecutively, and so we get either FHSPORLT or RSTLHOFP, neither of which defends performing S fourth. Thus option A isn't accurate.
  
  B: If L or H isn't performed at the end, it's performed before fourth if P is performed at some time before S; however, if the run of compositions is HLS into S fourth, the achieved third should be any except O if it's any better than HO, which it can't be, so neither L nor H as the eighth composition defies performing S fourth.

  Given that S is performed fourth and at least one composition is performed after O and before S, composition P should be first (since it is performed before S). Let's assume P is first. 
  From the constraint ""O is performed either first or fifth"", and ""At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F"", it means that when P comes first, O follows it.
  Hence, P and O are performed as the first two compositions.
  From the constraint ""T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R"" we know that T must precede F whenever R doesn't directly precede T.
  From this, and ""At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F"", it means that P and O (already played, so whenever it falls) mark the first two of the pieces that can be played, and not one of those sections must touch upon compositions F, H, R before arriving into a point nearly at half distance of the performance with another unplayed piece and once there T will pop into existence.
  H cannot come before T, P occurred before S, and R could only have occurred second completing that solution of T at 3F > H indicating nowL/H to be kept till later. 
  Through that if T is before F (Lemma 1), then R cannot immediately precede it, which means by same conflicting rules that you can't achieve T below 5 and since T rotates around where an (uncountable number), most T options dry up once one run of selections branches off towards following individuals of the set instead of the merger section directly splitting older’s triple selections assocoiation. Then plugging T into this region sealed choices for sequence B.
    Therefore accurately conducted formation of compositions performed in the fourth instance comes out as P being first conjoined comursively with O. Since T logically exists somewhere before F, it also rigorously passes. Choosing composition B compels a viable formation in agreement with all existing constraints, hence matching it with being correct going forth under this circumstance.

Case 1:

Case 2:

There should be no wall which has the work of only one student displayed on it.
Thus, in any case, the painting on Wall 1 can’t belong to only one one art student. Both option A and E violate this condition of the rule without any doubt.

Even though we don't know yet which side is Franz in, still this combo (Greene's watercolor sits upper to Franz's oil out of any way it goes sides), limit combinatorial options.

  If Greene doesn't get a look in at Wall 1, then they don""t get a wall.

- Xu will get a higher-numbered parking space than Souza
- Robertson will get a higher-numbered parking space than Young
- By logical deduction,
  - Robertson must either get #2 or #3, as per the above points. He cannot get #1 or #4.
  - If Young gets assigned the parking space #5, then Togowa must get #6 (Because Young must get higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.) Xu will get either #3 or #4 in this case, again Young will not get a higher-numbered parking space than him
  - But if Togowa is assigned #6, then Xu will get there and previous scenario is lost. For Togowa to not get #6, there should be another parking spot which someone would get other than Togowa and now the deduction rules from there, but really very complex.
- Thus the remaining distributions can be used using the above points
- From option (D),
  Robertson: #3 (point 4) 
  Togowa:    #1 (point 2)
  Young:     #2 (subsequent to point-4), So Togwa does get a lesser-numbered space compared to him as defined
  Souza:     #4 (as #3 will be taken by Robertson as deduced).
  Vaughn:    #5
  Xu:        #6 (Subsequent i.e Magento will have higher-soance space altogether)
- Therefore, answer is D

  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking spaces #5 or #6 because they are lower numbered parking spaces. 
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Young cannot be assigned parking space #5. However, he should get the highest up of #4. 
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Xu should get #5 or #6 at the very least.
  Hence, the parking space minimum values should be sorted like x(max 6),y,z({5|6}),?,?,w/min=4.Here,a total of six people are selected. We can start elimination by Canceling all options which doesnt allocate young at position 4 except option B. We can not select D as Souza is in position 1 in that case but Xu                              should be minimum in position 5 by the instructions.

  We don't know which parking space belongs to each person yet.
  The only information provided about this is that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, there are no other restrictions.
  Togowa must have a lower-numbered parking space than Young since Young needs a higher-numbered parking space.
  Xu must have a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  These two conditions put Togowa and Young respectively in parking spaces number 1-3 and 3-6.
  Robertson needs to have a higher-numbered parking space than Young but we do not yet know the parking space where Young has been placed as this can change with another assignment, we only know that a sequence like 1-Togowa-May-4-Young would be impossible.
  The only rule in regards to Vaughn is that there is no two places assigned the same.

    A -> This is not a possible arrangement because we can't satisfy the condition that Young has better parking spot than Togowa and also assign Robertson to landspace 1-4.

  Parra or Tiao not both works in Zone 1, and since neither Parra nor Tata is in either Zone 2 or Zone 3, they both should be in either Zone 1 or not the same zone, if the latter was impossible, one would have to be in Zone 1, but because of the restriction dealing with Parra and Quinnthey must be in the same zonethat would be impossible. So, Parra or Tiao maps with Zone 1. So we assume Parra works in Zone 1 rather than Tiao at first.
  Tiao or Udall not both works in Zone 2, so it combines with the other restriction dealing with Zone 1, so we find out where both can or conflictively can be.

4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
5. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

From 1 and 2, we can deduce that there are 3 representatives to be assigned (two for zone 3 and one for zone 1). The only representatives who haven't been assigned are Kim, Mahr and Tiao.
From 3 and 4, we know that we can place the pair Parra and Quinn together in one district and place the pair Stuckey and Udall in another.

Now if Mahr is chosen to work in Zone 1, it will bring the maximum factor of two representatives in Zone 1, but that gets tricky.    
Let's avoid that possibility and place either Parra or Tiao in Zone 1.
From condition five, we know Zone 3 has the most representatives, this most logical conclusion is for  both Mahr and Kim to be assigned to them. We get: Tiao (Zone 1), Mahr and Kim (Zone 3) and finally, Udall, Stuckey, and Parra-Quinn (Zone 2 hence their choice totalizing with Udall the factor of two there)

  A: F, M -> those two books should be on the other shelf indicating two books on each Middle and Top Shelf. So this option is not valid.
  B: F, H, M
     If F and M are together as mentioned then they have to be on a middle or top shelf. Now let's put F and M on the Top Shelf. Thus, the number of and arrangement of the books left would be in such a way that we can place H on the middle shelf because of the other conditions mentioned. The remaining books would go to the bottom shelf. Option B is valid.
  C: G, H, K -> Option C is not valid since I has to be kept on the middle shelf.
  D: F, G, M, O
     As per condition E and J, we know that both F and O cannot be on the same shelf andK is kept higher than F, if K is not on the top shelf, O cannot be either. So, The top shelf should not contain either Ferguson or Olyphant. Using option D we place F, G and M together which cannot be placed on the same shelf, So even by putting them on a different shelf people are not able to satisfy option D. Therefore this option is not valid too.

  First, I is placed on the middle shelf
  Next, F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore F and M must go on the middle or bottom shelf only since I is already placed on the middle shelf. So we can get possible arrangement where F and M on the middle shelf, with M above F or both are on the bottom shlef.
  More books will be placed on the bottom than the top, therefore, if we have one book on the top, then either we have three books of a particular set on the bottom shlef, e.g. LMO or two each of similarly sized book sets.

    This question can be a bit tricky so let us begin evaluating the answer choices one by one.
    If all of the prints in the museum store are either on loan to the museum or the museum’s permanent collection, then shop sells no prints of works that aren’t displayed in museum even those works arisen during twentieth-century. Therefore,  option A cannot be true.
    The statement only forces that every print that it sold is of a cohesive’s twentieth-century work. Therefore, the Option B is also not correct statement.
    The statement that option C makes asserts is oddly specific and can be easily proven wrong if, for example, the Hopper’s Nighthawks didn’t have a print suite. None information specifies that the museum of every work without exception and including any temporary exhibit was released as a prints correlation. Therefore option C also violates the information provided the curator in the preamble. 
    There is never any backing help for inspecting everywhere around Hopper's Nighwatch belonging to other collectors. And nothing speculates loans from private collectors necessarily whence rather permanent exhibitions inform shop table prints. Thus, whether or not the painting’s placed on loan does not eliminate the probabilities of having available prints. Therefore, this situation does not associate with (or deduct from) the theory held by the curator.

Not every twentieth-century works exhibited each after others in permanent place produced traveller bounced solely different properties forced by getting controlled through earlier artistry wave like monkeys after le Trocadero.

  Tocqueville agrees that nature has appointed different faculties or characteristics in man and woman and that by attempting to make one sex equal to the other will just lead to a weak generation of both sexes.
  Tocqueville believes that improvement consists of getting each sex to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Mill believes in complete liberty of choice and that individuals should have equal access to occupations.
  According to Mill, no fear that an occupation utilizing qualities that either sex is not permitted to use shall not exist.
  Therefore, neither author believes an individual's position in society should be determined by factors beyond their control, but for Mill, one should be allowed to follow the career or their own choosing.

The linear function for the speed of sound in air is given by $S(T)=0.6T+331.4$.
The temperature of 0 $^{\circ}$C is nowhere mentioned in S(T). Counting on one of the answer choices here may not be a wise move.
If we say that an increase of 1 $\degree$C is denoted as $\mathrm{d} T=1 \degree \mathrm{C}$, then using the given expression for $S(T)$, an increase of $1$ $\degree \mathrm{C}$ is accompanied by a corresponding increase of \\

  The reason for using plastic-tipped pliers is to make micro-adjustments to the bent frames more safely than trying to force them into shape by hand.
  The most likely completion to the text is to provide additional information about the type of pliers to use and what to do if you don't have them.
  Choice A provides additional information about the type of pliers to use and what to do if you don't have them.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Ordinary metal pliers may scratch or even snap thin wire frames. If you don't have a suitable set of pliers on hand, a plastic hand clamp or pair of forceps will also get the job done.

  The text is providing instructions on how to make a homemade ear cleaner.
  The first two steps are to get a small bottle and fill it with oil.
  The most likely completion to the text would be another step or substeps that provide additional instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Choice A talks about the size of the bottle and the possibility of the ear canal not fitting over a toothbrush, which is not relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner.
  Choice C talks about adding distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean and testing the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of the ear, which is not relevant to the instructions on how to make the ear cleaner either.

  The text then asks a question about the last time the person had sex.
  The most likely completion is to provide additional information about how to determine if the bleeding is implantation bleeding or not.
  Choice A talks about feeding and waiting for numbers to change, which is not relevant to the topic.
  Choice B talks about energy fluctuation during intercourse, which is also not relevant to the topic.
  Choice C provides additional information about how to determine if the bleeding is implantation bleeding or not.
  Choice D talks about a rash, which is not relevant to the topic.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.

  Option B doesn't seem likely because it doesn't make sense to put the weight down to raise it above his head.
  Option C doesn't seem likely because it doesn't make sense to lower his arms and his hands up.
  Option D seems likely because it is common for weightlifters to fail sometimes and be successful other times.

  The text is discussing how to find the best foundation color shade for you.
  The first step is to understand your undertone.
  The text then explains that your undertone will always stay the same, unlike the surface of your skin.
  The most likely completion to the text is an explanation of the different undertones and how to choose a foundation color based on your undertone.
  Choice A is not a likely completion because it talks about having a bluish undertone and working in an environment with low light, which is not relevant to the topic.
  Choice C is not a likely completion because it only talks about warm and neutral undertones, but there are actually three undertones.

The text is about how to keep children from waking up too early.
The title suggests that the first step is to identify possible reasons for the early wake time.
The step mentions that many children wake up early due to noise, hunger, or light.
The step also suggests keeping a record of the child's sleeping habits for one to two weeks.
The most likely completion is to note what time the child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. This will help identify any patterns in the child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light, or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.
Therefore, the answer is C: Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.

  The text is about how to help a child enjoy milk.
  The text suggests starting with small amounts of milk like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml) if the child refuses to drink milk.
  The most likely completion to the text is to suggest that if the child is willing to drink the small amount of milk, then gradually increase the amount of milk they drink.

The text is about how to keep children from waking up too early.
The title is ""Identify possible reasons for your toddler's early wake time.""
The step is ""Many children wake up early in the morning due to noise, hunger, or light. Try to keep a record of your child's sleeping habits for one to two weeks.""
The most likely completion is to note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.
Therefore, the answer is C: Note what time your child goes to bed, what time they wake up, and any naps they take during the day. You should try to identify any patterns in your child's sleep, and if noise, hunger, light or too many naps during the day are causing the early wake time.

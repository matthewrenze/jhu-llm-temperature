  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball aggressively and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the ball or the player.
  Option A is unlikely because it mentions a sumo, which is not related to lacrosse.

  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick.
  The player is trying to hit a goal.
  The prompt mentions ""his team member"".
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player's team member does something related to the ball or the goal.
  Choice A mentions that the team member passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats. This seems unlikely as it mentions a sumo wrestler, which is not related to lacrosse.
  Choice B mentions that the player spins quickly to evade the ball and missed the goal by two feet. This doesn't seem to fit with the prompt as it doesn't mention the player missing the goal or spinning.
  Choice C mentions that the player tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player. This seems like a reasonable completion to the text as it mentions the player following the ball and trying to keep it away from the opponent.
  Choice D mentions that the player fails the first time and he is called a loser. This seems unlikely as it mentions the player being called a loser, which is not a positive or supportive response.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.

  The text is about how to take care of pearls.
  The first step mentioned is to wear pearls after finishing everything and take them off first.
  The reason for this is that pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
  The most likely completion to the text is a continuation of the tips on how to take care of pearls.
  Option A talks about investing in more pearls and is not related to taking care of pearls.
  Option C talks about using old pearls and porcelain jars, which is not relevant to the topic.
  Option D suggests wearing pearls after bathing, but the text already mentioned that pearls should be worn after finishing everything.
  Option B talks about dressing up before wearing pearls and limiting the use of pearl rings and bracelets, which is relevant to the topic.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.

  The second step is a comparison between the eyes of a tense/fearful dog and a relaxed dog.
  The question asks for the most likely completion to the text.
  Choice A is not related to the text.
  Choice B is not related to the text and contains contradictory information.
  Choice C is related to the text but is not a completion of the text.
  Choice D is related to the text and completes the text by providing additional information about dilated pupils.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  The text is about how to recognize fear in dogs.
  The first step mentions that a dog who's tense or fearful may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal.
  The second step mentions that a relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
  The choices are all related to recognizing fear in dogs, but only one of them is a logical continuation of the text.
  Choice A talks about dogs appearing biting during relaxation or hiding from the thought of biting, which is not related to recognizing fear in dogs.
  Choice B talks about the whites of a dog's eyes looking milky, gray, or bloodshot, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Choice C talks about another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful, which is their pupils. This is related to recognizing fear in dogs, but it is not a logical continuation of the text.
  Choice D is a logical continuation of the text, as it mentions that seeing lots of white around a dog's eyes is another sign of fear or tension. It also adds that dilated pupils can occur when a dog has its eyes widened, which is related to recognizing fear in dogs.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The completion should describe what happens after she jumps over the bar.
  Option A suggests that she lands on a mat and marks her dark score. This is unlikely because the text does not mention any scoring or a dark score.
  Option B suggests that she is shown performing the act again in slow motion. This is also unlikely because the text does not suggest that the act will be repeated.
  Option C suggests that she lands on the grass with her arms outstretched. This is unlikely because high jump is typically performed on a mat, not on grass.

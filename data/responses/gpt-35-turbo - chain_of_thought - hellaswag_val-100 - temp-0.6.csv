  The title is ""How to ripen a cantaloupe"", so it makes sense to provide information on how to determine if a cantaloupe is ripe.
  Option A is incorrect because placing a cantaloupe on its side does not produce ripeness.
  Option B is incorrect because it talks about dark spots but the text does not mention anything about dark spots.
  Option C is incorrect because the text only talks about the color of the cantaloupe, not what happens after you slice it.
  Option D is correct because it provides a caveat to the information given in the first step, which is that you should never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green. It also explains that while a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet, a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe.
  Therefore, the answer is D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

  The text provides instructions on how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  The first step is to avoid harvesting a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green since these melons are unripe.
  The second step suggests checking the cantaloupe once the color changes to a tan or yellow color which indicates that it is probably ripe.
  The most likely completion is to provide additional information regarding how to determine if the cantaloupe is ripe.
  Choice A suggests placing the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness which was not mentioned in the text.
  Choice B provides a different way to determine if the cantaloupe is ripe by looking for dark spots or blackheads which was not mentioned in the text.
  Choice C suggests that a ripe cantaloupe turns a light brown after it is sliced, which is not related to determining whether the cantaloupe is ripe before it is sliced.
  Choice D provides additional information on how to determine if the cantaloupe is ripe by cautioning against harvesting a cantaloupe based solely on color and suggesting that a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

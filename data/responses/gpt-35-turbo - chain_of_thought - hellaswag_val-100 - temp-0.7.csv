  The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weights over his head several times.
  The sentence ""sometimes he"" needs a phrase that describes the outcome of the man's action.
  The phrase ""puts it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it"" doesn't make sense because it implies he puts the weight down before lifting it.
  The phrase ""lowers his arms and his hands up"" doesn't make sense grammatically.
  The phrase ""lifts so far he is dragged to the ground"" is unlikely because it would be dangerous and could result in injury.
  The most likely phrase is ""fails, other times he is successful"" because this describes the typical experience of weightlifters in training.

  The paragraph describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times in the presence of two other bodybuilders, and then dropping it. 
  The missing part of the text should logically describe what the bodybuilder does after dropping the weight bar.
  Option A states he wipes off sweat and lifts the weight bar again and drops it, which is illogical since he just dropped the weight bar and the description gives no indication the bodybuilder was sweating.
  Option C states that the bodybuilder drops the weight bar and other bodybuilders fall, which is confusing and unlikely since the other bodybuilders were just watching him. 
  Option D states that the bodybuilder drops down after running towards the weight, which is unlikely given that the bodybuilder was just lifting the weight bar.
  Option B states he releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, which is a logical completion. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.

  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar and dropping it down.
  The text then mentions two other bodybuilders watching him.
  The next sentence is incomplete and requires information about what the bodybuilder does next.
  Option A describes the bodybuilder wiping his sweat with a towel and lifting the weight bar again and dropping it. There is no mention of the bodybuilder doing this and therefore option A is incorrect.
  Option B describes the bodybuilder releasing the weight bar and beam he was holding and dropping it near the floor. This seems like a plausible action but it is unclear why the bodybuilder held a beam in the first place. Therefore, option B is also incorrect.
  Option C states that the bodybuilder continues lifting for another couple of seconds, which contradicts the text that says the bodybuilder dropped the weight bar. Furthermore, the option mentions that the other bodybuilders fall, which is not mentioned in the text. Hence, option C is not correct.
  Option D is completely unrelated to the text provided.

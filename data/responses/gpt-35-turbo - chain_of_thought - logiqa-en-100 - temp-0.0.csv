  The passage speculates that there may be living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence.
  We need to find a statement that refutes this speculation.
  Option A talks about the difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein, but it does not refute the speculation.
  Option B talks about the product of continuous socialization, but it does not refute the speculation.
  Option D talks about some interstellar molecules that are not found in the Earth's environment, but it does not refute the speculation.
  Option C talks about the probability of synthesizing amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules in the natural environment. If the probability is low, then the speculation that there may be living bodies on other planets than the earth is less likely to be true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  Option B is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that a 20% reduction in tuition fees will bring better economic benefits to W University.
  Option C is correct because it says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices, which is true.
  Option D is incorrect because the statement does not provide information about the enrollment growth of W University in 2007.

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A does not shake the traditional view, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the traditional view.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names. This statement challenges the traditional view and provides a new perspective.
  Statement C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Statement D provides an example of how a hexagram was named, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

  The passage states that the growth of energy consumption in a region is positively correlated with economic growth, and the difference in growth between the two is usually no more than 15%.
  In 2003, a statistical report from Zhejiang Province showed that the province's energy consumption increased by 30%, while the economic growth rate was 12.7%.
  Option A suggests that the growth of some private economy is difficult to be counted, which could explain the inconsistency.
  Option B suggests that some local officials underreported the economic growth figures, which could also explain the inconsistency.
  Option C suggests that the economic growth of large state-owned enterprises with high energy consumption generally declined due to the sharp increase in energy prices, which could explain the inconsistency.
  Option D suggests that 90% of the newly invested enterprises in Zhejiang are low-energy enterprises, which does not explain the inconsistency.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Due to the sharp increase in energy prices, 90% of the newly invested enterprises in Zhejiang are low-energy enterprises.

  The statement further mentions that a nebula recently discovered contained carbon formed billions of years ago when the universe was no more than 1.5 billion years old.

  The argument is that medieval Arab philosophers were interested in Aristotle's Poetics, which was not shared by Arab poets.
  The argument also states that a poet who was interested in Poetics must want to read Homer's poems.
  However, Homer's poems were not translated into Arabic until now.
  Therefore, the answer should support the argument that Homer's poems were not available to medieval Arab poets.
  Choice A talks about medieval Arabic translators owning the manuscripts of Homer poems in ancient Greek, but it does not say anything about whether they translated them into Arabic.
  Choice B talks about modern Arabic poets, which is not relevant to the argument about medieval Arab poets.
  Choice C talks about medieval Arabs writing dramas, but it does not say anything about Homer's poems.

  The inconsistency is that the survey result contradicts the experts' belief.

  Option B provides a possible explanation that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.

  Option B provides a possible explanation that the city that implements strict investigation of drunk driving has not eliminated drunk driving.
  This explanation suggests that although strict investigation of drunk driving is implemented, it may not be effective in eliminating drunk driving, which may still contribute to traffic accidents.

  The question asks for an explanation of the violation of common sense.
  The violation of common sense is that the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, after the US sovereign credit rating was lowered.
  The common sense is that investors should reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.
  To explain the violation of common sense, we need to find a statement that provides a reason why investors did not reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  Statement A is not relevant to the question.
  Statement B suggests that US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared with the bonds of other countries, which may explain why investors did not reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  Statement C is not relevant to the question.

  The argument is that seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that seals may have caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B suggests that seawater pollution is more harmful to cod than seals, but it does not address the relationship between seals and cod.
  Option C suggests that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the number of seals increased, which does not support the argument.
  Option D suggests that cod and seals share the same food source, which could mean that seals may have contributed to the decline in the number of cod.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.

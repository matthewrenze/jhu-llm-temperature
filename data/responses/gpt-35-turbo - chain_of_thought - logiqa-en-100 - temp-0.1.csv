  The statement also says that the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, but the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  This means that the demand for W University is elastic.
  Therefore, the change in tuition fees caused the total income and price to reverse.
  This means that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the opposite direction as prices.

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A does not shake the traditional view, as it does not provide any new information that contradicts the traditional view.
  Statement B suggests that the traditional view is incomplete and that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is necessary to explain all hexagram names. This statement challenges the traditional view and provides a new perspective.
  Statement C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not shake the traditional view.
  Statement D provides an example of how a hexagram name was created, but it does not challenge the traditional view.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram and then check each statement.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - T and P are next to each other, so they must be in warehouses 1 and 2 or in warehouses 5 and 6.
  - P is after F, so F cannot be in warehouse 6.
  - L is after T, so T cannot be in warehouse 6.
  - G is after L, so L cannot be in warehouse 6.
  - There are no restrictions on the position of M.
  Using these conditions, we can create a diagram:
  
  |___|___|___|___|___|___|
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  We know that T and P are next to each other, so they must be in warehouses 1 and 2 or in warehouses 5 and 6. Let's assume they are in warehouses 1 and 2:
  
  | T | P |___|___|___|___|
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  From condition (2), we know that L is after T, so L cannot be in warehouse 6. Let's assume L is in warehouse 5:
  
  | T | P |___|___| L |___|
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  From condition (1), we know that G is after L, so G cannot be in warehouse 5. Let's assume G is in warehouse 6:
  
  | T | P |___|___| L | G |
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  From condition (3), we know that P is after F, so F cannot be in warehouse 4 or 5. Let's assume F is in warehouse 3:
  
  | T | P | F |___| L | G |
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  From condition (4), we know that T is next to P, so T must be in warehouse 1 and P must be in warehouse 2:
  
  | P | T | F |___| L | G |
  1   2   3   4   5   6
  
  Now we can check each statement:
  A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M. We don't know where M is, so this statement could be true or false. 
  B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M. We don't know where M is, so this statement could be true or false.
  C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L. This is false, because T is between P and L.
  D: The warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F. This is false, because P is between F and L.

Option B: W is in public relations, which is possible. F is in the production department, which is a given condition. G, I, and X are in the sales department, which satisfies the condition that if X is in sales, W is in production. H and Y are in the production department, which satisfies the condition that H and Y must be in the same department. So, this option is valid.
Option C: X is in public relations, which is not possible as F must be in the production department. Also, G and H cannot be in the same department. So, this option is not valid.
Option D: X is in public relations, which is possible. F, I, and W are in the production department, which satisfies the condition that F must be in production and if X is in sales, W is in production.

  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then M and G must be stored in warehouses 1 and 3, or warehouses 2 and 4, or warehouses 3 and 5, or warehouses 4 and 6.
  From condition (1), the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L. Therefore, G cannot be stored in warehouses 1 and 3.
  From condition (2), the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouses 2 and 4.
  From condition (4), the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, T cannot be stored in warehouses 3 and 5.

  The expert's judgment is that the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%.
  The statement that most powerfully weakens the expert's judgment should be one that suggests that the probability of fire for TESLA's battery pack is higher than 0.14%.
  Option A, B, and D do not suggest that the probability of fire for TESLA's battery pack is higher than 0.14%.
  Option C suggests that TESLA has a very advanced battery management system, which will automatically disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells. This implies that TESLA's battery pack may have abnormal battery cells that could cause a fire, which weakens the expert's judgment.

  According to the conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - O must be on the third day, so the first two days must be one of G, H, J, K, L, M.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the third day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the third day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the third day.
  Therefore, L and M must be on the third day. 
  The person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day, so the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day. 
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be one of G, H, J, K.
  K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the fourth day.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be one of G, H, J.
  If the person on duty for two days is G, then J must be on the fourth day, which violates the condition that J should be placed on the next day of duty H.
  If the person on duty for two days is H, then J must be on the fourth day, which satisfies the condition that J should be placed on the next day of duty H.
  If the person on duty for two days is J, then G must be on the fourth day, which satisfies the condition that G must be on the same day as one of J and O.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be H or J, and the next day must be J.

  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the third day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the third day.
  Therefore, we can conclude that the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, and the person on duty for the first three days must be one of H, K, L, and M.
  Since J should be placed on the next day of duty H, and H cannot be on the third day, we can conclude that J must be on the fourth day.

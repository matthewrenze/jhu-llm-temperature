  The passage speculates that there may be living bodies on other planets based on the existence of amino acid molecules in the universe.
  To refute this speculation, we need to find a statement that contradicts the existence of living bodies on other planets.
  Option A talks about the difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein, but it does not directly refute the speculation.
  Option B talks about the factors that contribute to higher intelligence, but it does not directly refute the speculation.
  Option D talks about some interstellar molecules that are not found on Earth, but it does not directly refute the speculation.
  Option C, on the other hand, directly contradicts the speculation by stating that the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event in the natural environment.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  There are no two people with the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different hot dishes and 9 different cold dishes.
  For each chef, there are 9 choices for hot dishes and 9 choices for cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9x9=81 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  Since there are no two people with the same hot dishes and cold dishes, there are 81 different chefs.
  However, the question requires that no two chefs have the same skill level.
  Therefore, we need to find the number of chefs that can meet the condition of ""each result of the chef is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B"".
  If we choose Chef B, there are 80 other chefs to compare.
  For each chef, there are 3 possible outcomes: ""top grade"", ""middle grade"", and ""bottom grade"".
  If Chef B gets a ""bottom grade"" for both hot and cold dishes, there are 26 chefs that can meet the condition.
  If Chef B gets a ""bottom grade"" for one dish and a ""middle grade"" for the other, there are 54 chefs that can meet the condition.
  If Chef B gets a ""bottom grade"" for one dish and a ""top grade"" for the other, there are 80 chefs that can meet the condition.
  If Chef B gets a ""middle grade"" for both dishes, there are 26 chefs that can meet the condition.
  If Chef B gets a ""middle grade"" for one dish and a ""top grade"" for the other, there are 54 chefs that can meet the condition.
  If Chef B gets a ""top grade"" for both dishes, there are 26 chefs that can meet the condition.
  Therefore, there are a total of 26+54+80+26+54+26=266 chefs that can meet the condition.
  The answer is D: 3 people.

  However, there are chefs who are not more skilled than others, so some outcomes can be eliminated.
  If we choose one chef as the reference, there are 8 other chefs.
  For each of the 3^9 outcomes, we can compare it with the reference chef.
  If the outcome meets the condition that each result of the chef is not lower than that of the reference chef, and at least one item is higher than the reference chef, then this outcome is valid.
  If there are no valid outcomes, then the reference chef is not less skilled than any other chef.
  If there is at least one valid outcome, then the reference chef is less skilled than at least one chef.
  We can repeat this process for each chef to determine if they are less skilled than any other chef.

  There are no two people with the same hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are a total of 9 dishes (9 chefs x 2 dishes each).
  For each dish, there are 3 possible grades.
  Therefore, there are a total of 3^9 possible combinations of grades.
  For Chef A to be more skilled than Chef B, Chef A must have at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B and all other dishes with the same or higher grade than Chef B.
  There are 8 other chefs that Chef A can be compared to.
  For each comparison, Chef A can be more skilled, less skilled, or equally skilled as the other chef.
  Therefore, there are 3^8 possible outcomes for each comparison.
  To ensure that no two people have the same hot and cold dishes, we can assume that Chef A has the highest grade for one of the dishes, and Chef B has the highest grade for the other dish.
  This reduces the number of possible outcomes for each comparison to 2^8.
  Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is 2^8 x 8 = 2048.
  We need to find the number of combinations where each chef can be compared to all other chefs and be more skilled than at least one of them.
  This is a difficult calculation to do manually, but we can eliminate some options.
  If there are 9 chefs, then each chef can be compared to 8 other chefs.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef B cannot be more skilled than Chef A.
  Therefore, we can eliminate any combinations where Chef B is more skilled than Chef A.
  This reduces the number of possible outcomes to less than 2048.
  Therefore, the answer is not 9 people.
  It is also unlikely to be 6 people or 3 people, as these are relatively small numbers compared to the total number of possible outcomes.

  Since no two people have the same combination of dishes and grades, there can be at most 19683 chefs.
  However, we know that no chef is more skilled than any other chef.
  Therefore, we need to find the maximum number of chefs that can satisfy the condition that each chef's result is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B.
  Let's assume that Chef B has the worst possible result: ""bottom grade"" for both hot and cold dishes.
  Then, for each of the 9 hot and cold dishes, there are 2 possible results that Chef A can get: either ""top grade"" or ""middle grade"".
  Therefore, there are 2^9 = 512 possible combinations of hot and cold dishes and their grades that Chef A can get.

  The statement mentions that the demand for W University is flexible.
  Elastic demand means that a small change in price leads to a large change in quantity demanded.
  The statement also mentions that although the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  This means that the decrease in tuition fees led to an increase in the number of students enrolled.
  Therefore, the demand for W University is elastic.
  Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the given statement.
  Option B is irrelevant to the given statement.
  Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the given statement.
  Option D is also irrelevant to the given statement.

  The statement says that if the price change causes the total income and price to reverse, then demand is elastic.
  In 2007, although the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006, which means that the demand for W University is flexible.
  Therefore, we can conclude that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the opposite direction as prices.

  Option A is incorrect because it contradicts the statement. It says that if changes in prices result in changes in total income and prices in the same direction, then demand is elastic. This is not true.
  Option B is not necessarily true. The statement does not provide enough information to determine if a 20% reduction in tuition fees will bring better economic benefits to W University.
  Option C is incorrect because it contradicts the statement. It says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices. This is not true.

  Therefore, the best explanation for this counterintuitive practice in Japan is D: Many Japanese hope that the United States will withdraw its troops from Japan. Japan's self-disclosure of the Self-Defense Force's weaknesses aims to tell the people that Japan needs the protection of the United States militarily.

  The statement mentions that the early universe contained only hydrogen and helium.
  It also mentions that heavier elements like carbon can only be formed in the star's nuclear reaction.
  The statement says that a nebula recently discovered contained carbon formed billions of years ago when the universe was no more than 1.5 billion years old.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that some stars had already formed when the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old.
  The statement does not mention anything about the presence of hydrogen and helium in the nebula.
  The statement does not mention anything about the carbon in this nebula later forming part of some stars.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: When the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old, some stars had already formed.

  If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. So, X and W cannot be allocated to the same department.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that F is allocated to the production department, and X is allocated to the sales department.
  Now, we can consider the allocation of H and Y. H and Y cannot be allocated to the public relations department. So, H and Y are allocated to either production or sales department.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that W is allocated to the production department, and G, I, and Y are allocated to the sales department.

  The taxi drivers' attitude is contradictory because they object to the price increase, but the price increase is necessary to offset the impact of rising oil prices, which would otherwise decrease their income.
  To resolve this contradiction, we need to find an answer that explains why taxi drivers object to the price increase despite the fact that it is necessary to offset the impact of rising oil prices.
  Option A provides a possible explanation for the taxi drivers' attitude. If they hope to reduce the monthly rent paid to taxi companies, they may feel that the price increase is unfair and that they are being asked to bear the burden of rising oil prices.
  Option B does not provide any explanation for the taxi drivers' attitude.
  Option C is irrelevant to the taxi drivers' attitude towards the price increase.
  Option D does not provide any explanation for the taxi drivers' attitude.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Taxi drivers hope to reduce the monthly rent paid to taxi companies, thereby eliminating the impact of rising oil prices.

  The taxi drivers are against the price increase because they believe it will lead to a decrease in passengers.
  The taxi drivers may also be concerned about their own income.
  Option A suggests that the taxi drivers want to reduce the monthly rent paid to taxi companies, which could help offset the impact of rising oil prices.
  Option B suggests that all consumers are opposed to taxi price increases, but this does not explain the taxi drivers' attitude.
  Option C is irrelevant to the taxi drivers' attitude towards the price increase.
  Option D suggests that the cost of rising oil prices will be entirely borne by consumers, which could explain why taxi drivers are against the price increase.

  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then either M is stored in warehouse 1 and G is stored in warehouse 3, or M is stored in warehouse 2 and G is stored in warehouse 4, or M is stored in warehouse 3 and G is stored in warehouse 5, or M is stored in warehouse 4 and G is stored in warehouse 6.
  Condition (1) states that the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L.
  Condition (2) states that the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T.
  Condition (3) states that the warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F.
  Condition (4) states that the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P.
  From condition (4), we know that T and P must be stored in warehouses 2 and 3 or warehouses 3 and 4 or warehouses 4 and 5 or warehouses 5 and 6.
  If T and P are stored in warehouses 2 and 3, then F must be stored in warehouse 1 and L must be stored in warehouse 4. However, this violates condition (2) because the warehouse number storing L is not larger than the warehouse number storing T.
  If T and P are stored in warehouses 3 and 4, then F must be stored in warehouse 1, L must be stored in warehouse 5, and G must be stored in warehouse 6. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, there are 4 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.

  The violation of common sense is that the price of US Treasury bonds rose and the yield fell despite the downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating.
  The lower the credit rating of the borrower, the higher the cost of borrowing and the higher the rate of return for the creditor.
  The violation of common sense can be explained by the fact that US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared with the bonds of other countries.

  The common sense is that the lower the credit rating of the borrower, the higher the cost of borrowing and the higher the rate of return for the creditor.
  The violation of common sense can be explained if any of the following statements are true:

    - B: Compared with the bonds of the European Union, Japan and other countries, US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products.

    - D: In order to break the monopoly of three US rating agencies including S & P, the EU plans to establish a European credit rating agency.
  Statement B provides a possible explanation for the violation of common sense.
  If US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared with the bonds of other countries, investors may still prefer to hold US Treasuries even after the US sovereign credit rating was lowered.

  Choice A is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that all official history records are personal matters of the emperor's family.
  Choice B is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that wild history is the only way to know the little-known privacy of the emperor.
  Choice D is incorrect because the argument does not suggest that the official history records only the emperor's major affairs.
  Choice C is the assumption upon which the argument relies because it suggests that only by combining Zhengshi and Yeshi can we see the true face of the emperor.

  Therefore, the statement that cannot be used to question the claim is A, because it suggests that the high temperature and drought have occurred in the past, and the Three Gorges Reservoir was not there.

  The question asks which item cannot be used to question the statement that the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the high temperature and drought in Chongqing and Sichuan.
  If any of the items can be used to question the statement, it means that the statement is not necessarily true.
  Item A confirms that the hot and dry weather encountered in Chongqing and Sichuan this year is the worst in 50 years in terms of the scope and duration of the impact. This item does not question the statement.
  Item B confirms that the water range of the Three Gorges Reservoir area has an impact on climate of about 20 kilometers. This item does not question the statement.
  Item C explains that the relatively high water temperature in the western Pacific has caused the subtropical high pressure to be more northerly and more westward than in previous years, resulting in reduced precipitation in Chongqing and Sichuan. This item does not question the statement.
  Item D explains that the reduced snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau resulted in reduced water vapor output, which could have contributed to the drought in Chongqing and Sichuan. This item can be used to question the statement that the construction of the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the high temperature and drought in Chongqing and Sichuan.
  Therefore, the answer is D: From winter to spring, the snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 20% less than normal, resulting in a significant plateau thermal effect and reduced water vapor output.

  Option B provides information that supports the claim that the Three Gorges Reservoir has an impact on climate, so it cannot be used to question the claim.
  Option C provides an alternative explanation for the hot and dry weather in Chongqing and Sichuan, which can be used to question the claim that the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the weather.
  Option D also provides an alternative explanation for the hot and dry weather, which can be used to question the claim that the Three Gorges Reservoir caused the weather.

  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H.
  - Arrange K at least one day on the first or second day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O.
  Therefore, we can deduce the following order: 
  Day 1: K
  Day 2: G or J
  Day 3: O
  Day 4: H or J
  Since J should be placed on the next day of duty H, J must be ranked the next day.

  According to the conditions, we know that:
  - O is on the third day, so the first two days and the fourth day are left.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the fourth day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the fourth day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the fourth day.
  Therefore, we can infer that the person on duty for two days must be on the first two days. 
  Since J should be placed on the next day of duty H, and H cannot be on the fourth day, then H must be on the first day and J must be on the second day.
  Since K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, and H is on the first day, then K must be on the second day.
  Since G must be on the same day as one of J and O, and J is on the second day and O is on the third day, then G must be on the first day.
  Therefore, L must be ranked the next day after O.

  The speculation is that there may be living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence.
  To refute this speculation, we need to find a statement that contradicts this idea.
  A, B, and D do not directly contradict the speculation.
  C contradicts the speculation by stating that the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event, which means that the formation of life in the universe is less likely to occur.

  The study shows that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.
  95% of women who often eat celery rarely have aggressive feelings or are irritated.
  53% of women who do not eat celery often have anxiety, anger, and combative emotions.
  Option A provides a reason for why women who often eat celery may have suppressed aggressive emotions, which strengthens the conclusion of the study.
  Option B suggests that the female interviewees may not have answered truthfully, which weakens the conclusion of the study.
  Option C suggests that the effect of eating celery on suppressing aggressive emotions may be due to psychological and mental activities, which weakens the conclusion of the study.
  Option D provides additional benefits of celery, but it does not weaken the conclusion of the study.

  There are no two people who have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  So, there are 9 different dishes in total.
  We can divide the 9 dishes into 3 groups, each group has 3 dishes.
  Each group has one top grade, one middle grade, and one bottom grade.
  In each group, there can only be one dish that is evaluated as top grade.
  Therefore, there are 3 different ways to choose the top grade dishes.
  For the remaining 6 dishes, there are 2 different ways to choose the top grade dishes.
  So, there are 3 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 24 different ways to evaluate the dishes.
  Since no two people have the same evaluation results, there can be at most 24 chefs.

  If there are 24 chefs, we can divide them into 3 groups, each group has 8 chefs.
  In each group, there are 3 top grade chefs, 3 middle grade chefs, and 2 bottom grade chefs.
  Let's consider Chef A and Chef B in the same group.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef A must have at least 1 dish that is evaluated as top grade, and Chef B has none.
  However, in each group, there are only 3 top grade dishes, and each dish can only be evaluated as top grade once.

  For each chef, there are 9 choices of hot dishes and 9 choices of cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 81 possible combinations of dishes for each chef.
  Since no two chefs have the same combination of dishes, there are a total of 81 * 80 * 79 * 78 * 77 * 76 * 75 * 74 * 73 = 1.8871927 × 10^17 possible combinations of dishes for all chefs.
  Since there are no two chefs who are more skilled than each other, each chef must have at least one dish that is lower than that of another chef.
  Therefore, each chef can only have a maximum of 2 grades (top grade, middle grade, and bottom grade) for each dish.
  There are 3 grades for each dish, so there are 3 * 3 = 9 possible combinations of grades for each chef.
  Since no two chefs have the same combination of grades, there are a total of 9! = 362880 possible combinations of grades for all chefs.
  Since each chef can only have a maximum of 2 grades for each dish, there are only 3 possible combinations of grades that can satisfy the condition ""Chef A is more skilled than Chef B"".
  Therefore, the number of chefs that can meet the above conditions is the number of ways to choose 2 chefs from a group of n chefs, which is n(n-1)/2.

  However, no two people have the same combination of dishes.
  Therefore, there can be at most 81 chefs.
  But the question states that no two chefs have the same skill level.

  The statement says that when the price change causes the total income and price to reverse, then demand is elastic.
  The statement also says that in 2007, although the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006. This means that demand for W University is flexible.
  We need to find a statement that must be true based on the above statements.
  Option A is incorrect because the statement says that demand is elastic when the price change causes total income and price to reverse, which is the opposite of what option A states.
  Option B is incorrect because the statement does not provide any information about the economic benefits of W University.
  Option C is incorrect because the statement says that demand is elastic when the price change causes total income and price to reverse, which is the opposite of what option C states.

  The statement says that the demand for W University is flexible.
  Elastic demand means that changes in prices will cause total income to change in the opposite direction to prices.
  The statement also says that although the tuition fees decreased, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  This means that the demand for W University is elastic.
  Therefore, the correct answer should be related to elastic demand.
  A is incorrect because it says that if changes in prices result in changes in total income and prices in the same direction, then demand is elastic, which is incorrect.
  B is incorrect because it only talks about economic benefits and does not relate to elastic demand.
  C is correct because it says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the opposite direction as prices.

  The statement tells us that the demand for W University is elastic because the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006, even though the tuition fees decreased by 20%.
  Elastic demand means that a small change in price leads to a large change in the quantity demanded.
  If demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the opposite direction to prices.

  Option B mentions that the hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone or the sense of meaning alone, which could challenge the traditional view.
  Option C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it doesn't shake the traditional view.
  Option D talks about the story behind the naming of Kun Gua, but it doesn't shake the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The hexagram name cannot be explained by the orientation theory alone, nor can it be explained by the sense of meaning alone. Only by combining the two can we give an explanation of all hexagram names.

  The passage mentions that the traditional view is that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction or has no meaning.
  The passage also mentions that the fiction says that the Eight Diagrams are named after the name of an object, and the image of hexagrams represents the principle of things, and its rationality is taken as the name of a hexagram.
  Option A mentions that the reason why the two hexagrams of Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams is because the Qian gua represents heaven and the Kun gua represents earth, but this does not shake the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.

  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the relationship between the warehouses and the goods stored in them.
  From the diagram, we can determine which of the statements must be false.
  (1) The warehouse storing G is larger than that for storing L. So, G cannot be stored in warehouse 1 or 2. L cannot be stored in warehouse 5 or 6. Therefore, G must be stored in warehouse 3 or 4, and L must be stored in warehouse 4, 5, or 6.
  (2) The warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. So, T cannot be stored in warehouse 6. Therefore, T must be stored in warehouse 4 or 5, and L must be stored in warehouse 5 or 6.
  (3) The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F. So, F cannot be stored in warehouse 6. Therefore, F must be stored in warehouse 1, 2, or 3, and P must be stored in warehouse 4, 5, or 6.
  (4) The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. So, T and P must be stored in warehouses 4 and 5 in some order.
  From the above conditions, we can create a diagram as follows:
  
  |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |  5  |  6  |
  |  F  |     |     |  P/T|  T/P|  L  |

  Statement B must be true because G is next to M in warehouse 3.
  Statement C must be true because P is next to L in warehouse 5.
  Statement D must be false because L and F are not next to each other.

  - A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M. This is possible, so it is not necessarily false.
  - B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M. This is not possible, since M cannot be next to G. Therefore, this answer must be false.
  - C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L. This is possible, so it is not necessarily false.
  - D: The warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F. This is not possible, since L > T and T is next to P. Therefore, this answer must be false.

    - If the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge does not cause significant problems for transportation.
    - If most international ships entering the Yangtze River are not affected by the Nanjing Bridge.
    - If there are other bridges with the same height as the Nanjing Bridge that also hinder the passage of giant ships.
    - If the shipbuilding technology is so advanced that the ships can pass through the Nanjing Bridge without any problem.
  Based on the above analysis, statement B can raise the most doubts about the expert's point of view.

  We need to find a statement that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view.
  A: This statement supports the expert's point of view. It suggests that the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge is causing problems for transportation of goods.
  B: This statement suggests that most international ships do not go above the Nanjing Bridge, so it may not be necessary to demolish and rebuild the bridge.
  C: This statement suggests that there are other bridges with the same clear height as the Nanjing Bridge, so demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge alone may not be enough.
  D: This statement suggests that shipbuilding technology has advanced and larger ships have already passed through the Nanjing Bridge, so it may not be necessary to demolish and rebuild the bridge.
  Therefore, the statement that raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view is B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.

  A: This statement supports the expert's point of view because a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge.
  B: This statement does not directly relate to the Nanjing Bridge and its impact on the waterway. It does not raise doubts about the expert's point of view.
  C: This statement suggests that there are other bridges with a clear height of 24 meters that also need to be dismantled, which could raise doubts about the feasibility of demolishing and rebuilding all these bridges.
  D: This statement suggests that shipbuilding technology has advanced enough to allow 8000-ton ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, which could raise doubts about the need to demolish and rebuild the bridge.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Shipbuilding technology is highly developed, and 8000-ton ships designed for adapting to the passage of the Yangtze River abroad have passed through Nanjing to Wuhan.

  The previous sentences mention that the wine should be refined and good to drink.
  The advertisers are holding Bancheng Shaoguo.
  In order to make the last sentence a logical inference, we need to add a premise that connects Bancheng Shaoguo to the characteristics of good wine mentioned earlier.
  The premise that connects Bancheng Shaoguo to the characteristics of good wine is that its craft is excellent.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The craft of Bancheng casserole is excellent.

  The survey found that the incidence of traffic accidents is similar in cities with and without strict investigation of drunk driving.
  However, most experts believe that strict investigation of drunk driving can reduce the occurrence of traffic accidents.
  This is an inconsistency because the survey's finding contradicts the experts' belief.
  To eliminate this inconsistency, we need to find an option that explains why the survey may have found that strict investigation of drunk driving did not reduce the incidence of traffic accidents.
  Option B provides a possible explanation for the inconsistency by suggesting that although the city implements strict investigation of drunk driving, it has not eliminated drunk driving.

  The violation of common sense is that the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
  The common sense is that investors should reduce their holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement that can explain why investors did not reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds, but instead increased their holdings, leading to a rise in bond prices and a fall in yields.
  Statement A is irrelevant to the question, as it only talks about an error in S&P's rating calculations.

  The argument states that seals rarely eat cod, so the increase in the number of seals is unlikely to have caused the decline in the number of cod.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that seals may have contributed to the decline in cod despite the fact that seals rarely eat cod.
  Option A talks about the inconvenience caused by seals to fishing boats, but it does not suggest that seals have contributed to the decline in cod.
  Option B talks about seawater pollution, but it does not suggest that seals have contributed to the decline in cod.
  Option C suggests that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the number of seals increased, which weakens the argument, but it does not suggest that seals have contributed to the decline in cod.
  Option D suggests that cod and seals share the same food source, which means that an increase in the number of seals could result in a decrease in the number of capelin, which is the main food for cod. This statement weakens the argument most strongly by suggesting that seals may have contributed to the decline in cod despite the fact that seals rarely eat cod.

    - The hot and dry weather encountered in Chongqing and Sichuan this year is the worst in 50 years in terms of the scope and duration of the impact.
    - This year, the relatively high water temperature in the western Pacific has caused the subtropical high pressure to be more northerly and more westward than in previous years. At the same time, the cold air in the north is weaker, resulting in reduced precipitation in Chongqing and Sichuan.
    - From winter to spring, the snowfall on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau is 20% less than normal, resulting in a significant plateau thermal effect and reduced water vapor output.
  The following item provides information about the impact of the Three Gorges Reservoir on climate:

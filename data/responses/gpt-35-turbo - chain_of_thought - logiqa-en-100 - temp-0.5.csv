  The question asks for the statement that does not weaken the conclusion.
  The conclusion is that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.
  Choice A weakens the conclusion because it suggests that the reason why women who often eat celery rarely have aggressive feelings is not due to the celery but due to the physical exhaustion from fitness.
  Choice B weakens the conclusion because it suggests that the women may have answered the questions in a way that they think the researchers want to hear.
  Choice C weakens the conclusion because it suggests that the effect of eating celery is like a placebo, which means that the effect is not due to the celery itself.
  Choice D does not weaken the conclusion because it provides a list of benefits of celery that may support the conclusion.

  Each chef makes two dishes, a hot dish, and a cold dish.
  There are no two people with the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 2 dishes/person * n people = 2n dishes.
  There are 3 grades for each dish, so there are 3^2n possible outcomes.
  To be more skilled than Chef B, Chef A must have at least one higher result and no lower results.
  Therefore, there are (3-1)*3^(2n-1) possible outcomes where Chef A is more skilled than Chef B.
  We need to find n that satisfies the condition that no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, and any two chefs can be compared to determine who is more skilled.
  If n = 1, there are only 2 dishes, and it is impossible to find 2 chefs who have different dishes.
  If n = 2, there are 8 dishes, and there are 8!/(2!*2!*2!*2!) = 2,520 ways to assign the dishes to the 4 chefs. 
  For each pair of chefs, there are 2*(3-1)*3^3 = 54 possible outcomes where one chef is more skilled than the other. 
  There are 6 pairs of chefs, so there are 6*54 = 324 possible outcomes, which is less than 2,520. 
  Therefore, it is possible to find 4 chefs who have different dishes and can be compared to determine who is more skilled. 
  If n > 2, there will be more dishes than the number of ways to assign them to the chefs, so it is impossible to find n chefs who have different dishes and can be compared to determine who is more skilled.

  Since no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, there are no duplicates.
  If we consider the skill level of the chefs as grades, then there are three possible grades: top, middle, and bottom.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef A must have at least one dish that is graded higher than that of Chef B.
  Since there are no duplicates, each chef must have at least one dish that is graded higher than that of all other chefs.
  Therefore, there can be at most one chef with a top-grade hot dish, one chef with a top-grade cold dish, two chefs with a middle-grade hot dish, two chefs with a middle-grade cold dish, two chefs with a bottom-grade hot dish, and two chefs with a bottom-grade cold dish.
  The total number of chefs is the sum of the number of chefs with a top-grade dish, the number of chefs with a middle-grade dish, and the number of chefs with a bottom-grade dish.
  If there are 3 chefs with a top-grade dish, 3 chefs with a middle-grade dish, and 3 chefs with a bottom-grade dish, then the total number of chefs is 9.

  The question states that there are a number of existing chefs, but it does not give a specific number.
  No two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, so there are no duplicates.
  Since no one is more skilled than the other, we can assume that there is an equal distribution of grades among the chefs.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef B cannot have the highest grade in both dishes.
  Therefore, for each combination of hot and cold dishes, there can only be one chef with the highest grade for both dishes.
  If we assume that there are three grades (top, middle, and bottom), then there are a total of 9 possible combinations of grades for each chef (3 hot dish grades * 3 cold dish grades).
  For each combination of grades, there can only be one chef with the highest grade for both dishes.
  Therefore, the maximum number of chefs that can meet the above conditions is equal to the number of unique combinations of grades.
  The number of unique combinations of grades is 9 (one for each possible combination of grades).

  According to the given conditions, no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, so each chef has a unique hot dish and a unique cold dish.
  For two chefs A and B, if each result of A is not lower than that of B, and at least one item is higher than B, it is said that ""A is more skilled than B"". 
  Since no chef is more skilled than the other, for any two chefs A and B, either A is less skilled than B, or A is more skilled than B, or A is equally skilled as B. 
  If there are n chefs, there are C(n,2) pairs of chefs, and each pair of chefs can only be in one of the three situations mentioned above.
  Therefore, the number of chefs n must satisfy C(n,2) = the sum of 0 to n-1, which is n*(n-1)/2.
  Solving the equation n*(n-1)/2 = C(n,2) = n*(n-1)/2, we get n=3.

  If there are n chefs, then the number of hot dishes and cold dishes is 2n.
  Since no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, each combination of hot and cold dishes can only appear once.
  Therefore, the number of combinations of hot and cold dishes is C(2n, 2), which is (2n)*(2n-1)/2.
  We can assume that Chef A is the most skilled chef, and Chef B is the least skilled chef.
  For each of the remaining n-1 chefs, there are two possibilities:
    - Chef A is more skilled than Chef B
    - Chef B is more skilled than Chef A
  Since there are n-1 chefs, there are 2^(n-1) ways to assign the relative skill levels of the chefs.
  For each assignment of relative skill levels, we need to check whether there exists a chef that is more skilled than Chef A and less skilled than Chef B.
  If such a chef exists, then the assignment is not valid.
  Otherwise, the assignment is valid.
  Therefore, we need to check all possible assignments of relative skill levels.
  Since there are 2^(n-1) assignments, we need to check each of them, which takes exponential time.
  Therefore, it is not practical to compute the answer for large values of n.
  For small values of n, we can manually check the assignments of relative skill levels.
  When n=2, there is only one chef besides Chef A and Chef B, and there are two possibilities for the hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 2*2=4 possible combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  There are also 2^(2-1)=2 possible assignments of relative skill levels.
  We can check each assignment and see that both of them are valid.
  Therefore, there are 2 valid assignments of relative skill levels.
  In one assignment, Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, and in the other assignment, Chef B is more skilled than Chef A.

  If no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, we can assume that there are 9 different dishes in total.
  If no one is more skilled than the other, we can assume that each chef has an equal chance of getting top, middle, or bottom grade for each dish.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef A must have at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B.
  Since there are 9 different dishes in total, and each chef can only make 2 dishes, there are C(9,2) = 36 different combinations of dishes that can be made.
  We can assume that each chef is equally likely to make any of these 36 combinations of dishes.
  Therefore, we need to find the number of combinations of chefs such that each chef meets the condition of being more skilled than any other chef.
  If we choose any two chefs, there is exactly one combination of dishes that they both make.
  If one chef is more skilled than the other, then the more skilled chef must have a higher grade for at least one of the dishes.
  There are 3 possible grades for each dish, so there are 3*3 = 9 possible combinations of grades for the two dishes.
  Since the more skilled chef must have a higher grade for at least one dish, there are 8 possible combinations of grades that satisfy this condition.
  Therefore, there are 8/9 possible combinations of grades for each pair of chefs.
  If we assume that each chef is equally likely to have any combination of grades, then the probability that two randomly chosen chefs meet the condition of one being more skilled than the other is 8/9.
  Using the formula for the number of combinations of n items taken k at a time, we can calculate the number of combinations of 9 items taken 2 at a time as C(9,2) = 36.
  Therefore, the number of combinations of 2 chefs that meet the condition of one being more skilled than the other is (8/9) * 36 = 32.
  We can choose 3 chefs from the 9 chefs in C(9,3) = 84 ways.
  If we choose any 3 chefs, there are C(3,2) = 3 possible pairs of chefs.
  Therefore, there are 3 * 32 = 96 pairs of chefs that meet the condition of one being more skilled than the other.

  Choice C talks about unemployed people buying necessities such as food, which is not enough to show that they will have money to buy other goods.
  Choice D talks about unemployed people compressing expenditures and having savings for consumption, which suggests that they will have the money to buy goods other than necessities.
  Therefore, choice D is the best option to weaken Li Ming's argument.

  The question is asking for a statement that shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage mentions that the traditional view believes that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction, or there is no meaning.
  Statement A simply explains the reason why Qiankun ranks first among the sixty-four hexagrams, but it does not shake the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  Statement B suggests that a combination of the orientation theory and the sense of meaning is needed to explain all the hexagram names, which does not necessarily shake the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  Statement C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the Gua name, but it does not necessarily shake the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  Statement D provides a new explanation for the origin of the name of the Kun gua, which shakes the traditional view that the origin of the names of the Eight Diagrams and Sixty-four Diagrams in Zhouyi is fiction or has no meaning.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The name of the hexagram comes from the account of the narration of the hexagram.Kun Guazhan asked about the loss of the horse.At the beginning, he had three elephants.He believed that the horse could be found and was named Kun.

  The report shows that the province's energy consumption increased by 30%, while the economic growth rate was 12.7%.
  The difference between the two is larger than 15%.
  We need to find an option that cannot reasonably explain the inconsistency in the above.
  Option A implies that some private economy growth was not counted, which could have contributed to the economic growth rate being lower than expected.
  Option B implies that some local officials underreported the economic growth figures, which could have contributed to the economic growth rate being lower than expected.

  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Therefore, if Dr.Li is responsible for the treatment of a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
  Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu are responsible for treating the remaining 4 adult patients.
  Dr.Wang can treat up to two patients, and Dr.Liu can also treat up to two patients. Therefore, Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu must each treat two patients.

  If any of the choices show that the expert's point of view is not necessary or not the best solution, then that choice would raise doubts about the expert's point of view.
  Choice A indicates that a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge. This supports the expert's point of view that the bridge is hindering the passage of giant ships.

  Therefore, the argument concludes that there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
  The loophole in the argument is that the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.
  The fact that most crimes involving firearms did not result in homicides does not mean that the illegal use of firearms should not be distinguished as a serious criminal offense.
  Therefore, the logic loophole in the argument is similar to option B, where the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises.

  The passage speculates that there may be living bodies on other planets.
  To refute this speculation, we need to find a statement that contradicts this possibility.
  Option A talks about the difference between the process of developing from protein to organic life and the process from organic molecules to protein, which is not related to the speculation.
  Option B talks about the origin of higher intelligence, which is also not related to the speculation.
  Option D talks about some interstellar molecules that are not found on Earth and not available in the laboratory, which is also not related to the speculation.
  Option C is related to the speculation, as it suggests that the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event in the natural environment, which means it is less likely that there are living bodies on other planets.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  The argument is that the law will completely protect workers from second-hand smoke.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts or challenges this claim.
  Option A talks about the harmful effects of car exhaust, but it does not address the effectiveness of the smoking ban in protecting workers from second-hand smoke.
  Option B talks about certain workers who work at their employer's home, but it does not address the effectiveness of the smoking ban in protecting workers from second-hand smoke.
  Option C may suggest that the argument could be weakened, but it is too general and does not specifically address the effectiveness of the smoking ban.
  Option D contradicts the argument by stating that the law overestimates the dangers of second-hand smoke, thus weakening the argument.

  The report concludes that health care costs have increased over the years, while medical conditions have improved.
  To question this conclusion, we need to find an option that contradicts or weakens the conclusion.
  Option A suggests that the majority of healthcare costs are spent on high-tech intensive care for high-risk patients, which can mean that the increase in healthcare costs is not necessarily linked to the improvement of medical conditions.
  Option B suggests that medical conditions may improve without increasing costs, which weakens the conclusion that the increase in healthcare costs is directly linked to the improvement of medical conditions.
  Option C suggests that most of the state's allocation to the health sector is for infrastructure construction, which may not necessarily lead to an improvement in medical conditions.

  Choice A suggests that the majority of health care costs are spent on high-tech intensive care for high-risk patients. This raises the question of whether the overall improvement in medical conditions justifies the cost of high-tech intensive care.
  Choice B suggests that health conditions may improve without increasing costs. This does not necessarily contradict the conclusion, as it is possible that increased costs have contributed to the improvement in health conditions.
  Choice C suggests that a large portion of the state's allocation to the health sector is for infrastructure construction. This does not necessarily contradict the conclusion, as it is possible that the infrastructure development has contributed to the improvement in health conditions.
  Choice D suggests that the cost of care for elderly chronic diseases is very large. This does not necessarily contradict the conclusion, as it is possible that the improvement in medical conditions has led to longer life expectancy and therefore more elderly people receiving care for chronic diseases.

  According to the conditions, none of the chefs is more skilled than the other.
  For two chefs A and B, if each result of the chef A is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that ""Chef A is more skilled than Chef B"". Therefore, the results of the hot and cold dishes of Chef A and Chef B must be different.
  Since there are a number of existing chefs, no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, and each person can make a top grade, middle grade, or bottom grade dish for each of the two dishes, there are 3*3=9 possible outcomes for each chef.
  In order for Chef A to be more skilled than Chef B, Chef A must have at least one result higher than Chef B. Since none of the chefs is more skilled than the other, each chef must have at least one result that is not the highest. Therefore, each chef has two possible outcomes: (middle, top) or (bottom, middle).
  We can list all possible outcomes for each chef, and we find that there are six different outcomes, which can be paired up to form three pairs of chefs such that one chef in each pair is more skilled than the other.

  Therefore, there are 3! × 3! = 36 chefs.
  For each chef, there are 35 other chefs to compare.
  If the chef is more skilled than Chef B, at least one item is higher than Chef B, and the other two items are not lower than Chef B.
  Therefore, 35 chefs can be divided into groups, and each group contains 2 chefs. One chef's score is higher than Chef B, and the other chef's score is lower than Chef B.
  Therefore, each group has one chef more skilled than Chef B.
  Therefore, there are 18 chefs more skilled than Chef B, and there are also 18 chefs less skilled than Chef B.

  The requirement for Chef A to be considered more skilled than Chef B is that each result of Chef A is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B.
  Given that no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, and no chef is more skilled than the other, we can assume that each chef has a unique combination of hot and cold dishes and that there are three grades (top, middle, and bottom) for each dish.
  To find the number of chefs that meet the above conditions, we can start with the assumption that there is only one chef who is more skilled than all other chefs. We can then evaluate the number of chefs that would meet the above conditions if this assumption were true.
  If there is one chef who is more skilled than all other chefs, then that chef must have a combination of hot and cold dishes that is better than all other combinations. This means that there can only be one chef with the top grade for both hot and cold dishes. There can be two chefs with the middle grade for both hot and cold dishes, and there can be two chefs with the bottom grade for both hot and cold dishes. This gives us a total of five chefs.
  However, we also need to consider the possibility that there is no chef who is more skilled than all other chefs. In this case, the answer would be less than five.

  Therefore, Chef A can only be more skilled than 8 other chefs, because there is always one chef whose dish is higher than Chef A's dish.

  There are several chefs and none of them is more skilled than the other.
  Chef A is more skilled than Chef B if each result of Chef A is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one result is higher than Chef B.
  Therefore, there must be a ranking among the chefs.
  There are three grades of results: top grade, middle grade, and bottom grade.
  If there are n chefs, there are n choices for the top grade, n-1 choices for the middle grade (excluding the chef who got the top grade), and n-2 choices for the bottom grade (excluding the two chefs who got the top and middle grades respectively).
  For each chef, there are two dishes: hot and cold.
  If there are n chefs, there are C(n, 2) choices for the hot dishes and C(n, 2) choices for the cold dishes.
  Since no two people have the same hot and cold dishes, there are C(n, 2) * C(n-2, 2) different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, we need to find a number n that satisfies the following conditions:
  1. n choices for the top grade, n-1 choices for the middle grade, and n-2 choices for the bottom grade.
  2. C(n, 2) * C(n-2, 2) different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  3. n chefs and no two people have the same hot and cold dishes.
  We can try different values of n to see which one satisfies the above conditions.
  If n=3, there are 3 choices for the top grade, 2 choices for the middle grade, and 1 choice for the bottom grade.
  There are C(3, 2) * C(1, 2) = 0 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.

  If n=4, there are 4 choices for the top grade, 3 choices for the middle grade, and 2 choices for the bottom grade.
  There are C(4, 2) * C(2, 2) = 6 different combinations of hot and cold dishes for each chef.

  The statement further mentions that the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  According to the law of demand, if the price of a good or service decreases, the demand for it will increase.
  Therefore, the reduction in tuition fees led to an increase in demand for W University.
  This increase in demand led to an increase in the total tuition fees received by W University in 2007 compared to 2006.
  The statement does not provide information on the direction of changes in total income and prices.
  The statement does not provide information on the enrollment growth of W University in 2007.

  According to the law of demand, if the price of a good decreases, the demand for that good will increase.
  Therefore, the statement implies that the demand for W University is price sensitive.
  Elastic demand is a type of price sensitivity of demand where a small change in price leads to a large change in demand.
  Therefore, if the demand for W University is elastic, then a small change in tuition fees will lead to a large change in enrollment.
  Hence, the statement implies that if the demand is elastic, then the price changes will cause total income to change in the opposite direction as prices.

  The conclusion is that professional scammers are too stupid and too undedicated because they use unsophisticated mobile fraud messages.
  We need to find a statement that refutes this conclusion.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the necessity of being smart to deceive others, but it does not provide any information about the scammers' dedication.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about the scammer's ability to avoid the police, but it does not provide any information about the scammers' dedication.
  Option C is also irrelevant as it talks about the scam's effect, but it does not provide any information about the scammers' dedication.
  Option D provides an alternative explanation for why scammers use such text messages. They use these messages to filter out smart people from the beginning. This suggests that the scammers are dedicated and have a specific strategy in mind.

    Then Dr.Li must be responsible for treating K.
    Dr.Wang must treat H and I.
    Dr.Liu must treat either H, I, J, or K.
    In this case, Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient. However, Dr.Wang is not responsible for treating any child patient.
  Case 2: Dr.Zhang is responsible for treating E and F, and either J or K.
    Then Dr.Li must be responsible for treating either H or I, and either J or K.
    Dr.Wang must treat either H, I, or J, and either J or K.
    Dr.Liu must treat either H, I, or J, and either J or K.

P is stored in a warehouse that is larger than the warehouse where F is stored. T is stored in a warehouse that is next to the warehouse where P is stored.

  To weaken this argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that seals might have caused a significant decline in the number of cod despite not eating them.
  Option A does not address the impact of seals on cod, so it cannot weaken the argument.
  Option B states that seawater pollution is more harmful to cod than seals, but it does not address the impact of seals on cod, so it cannot weaken the argument.
  Option C suggests that the decline in cod preceded the increase in seals, so it weakens the argument only indirectly.

  Choice C does not weaken the argument either, since it only states a fact that the number of cod was already greatly reduced before the increase in the number of seals.
  Choice D, however, suggests that seals and cod both eat capelin, which means that an increase in the number of seals could lead to a decrease in the number of capelin, which could in turn cause a decline in the number of cod.

  The argument claims that most firearm crimes do not result in homicides, therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense.
  However, the argument ignores the fact that firearm crimes that do result in homicides are still more likely to occur than other types of crimes.
  Therefore, the argument's conclusion is not supported by the premise.
  Choice B has a similar logic loophole where the argument ignores the fact that even though a small percentage of people with unchecked sex are infected with AIDS, unchecked sex is still more likely to lead to AIDS than checkpoint.

  The argument suggests that since most crimes involving firearms do not result in homicides, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
  This argument assumes that the only reason to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense is to prevent homicides.
  However, there may be other reasons to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense, such as to prevent injuries, to deter crime, or to promote public safety.
  Therefore, the logic loophole in the argument is that it assumes that the only reason to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense is to prevent homicides.
  The answer is D: High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people.But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy.Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.
  This argument assumes that the only reason to pursue a happy life is to have a high income. However, there may be other reasons to pursue a happy life, such as to have fulfilling relationships, to pursue meaningful work, or to engage in hobbies and interests.

  The passage talks about the possibility of other planets having living bodies with higher intelligence.
  We need to find an option that refutes this speculation.
  Option A talks about the difference in processes between developing from protein to organic life and organic molecules to protein, but it doesn't say anything that refutes the possibility of living bodies on other planets.
  Option B talks about higher intelligence being a product of socialization as well, but it also doesn't refute the possibility of living bodies on other planets.
  Option D talks about some interstellar molecules not being available in the laboratory, but it doesn't refute the possibility of living bodies on other planets.
  Option C talks about the probability of synthesis of amino acid molecules being small in the natural environment, which does refute the possibility of living bodies on other planets as it makes the development of organic life less likely.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  The argument explains why herbal medicines are more likely to maintain their effectiveness than standard antibiotics when fighting new resistant bacteria.
  The reason is that standard antibiotics contain only one active ingredient, while herbal antibacterial drugs contain many.
  Therefore, it is difficult for a strain to develop resistance to herbal medicines.
  This is similar to the reasoning that if a chef wants to please many guests, it is much harder than satisfying one guest.

  There are no two people with the same hot and cold dishes, so we can assume that there are 9 different hot dishes and 9 different cold dishes.
  In order for Chef A to be more skilled than Chef B, Chef A must have at least one dish graded higher than Chef B.
  This means that Chef A can be compared to 8 other chefs, and can only win against 4 of them (given there are 3 grades).
  Therefore, for each of the 9 chefs, there can be at most 4 chefs who have a lower grade for both hot and cold dishes.

  If no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, then there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  If no one is more skilled than the other, then every chef must have the same number of top, middle, and bottom grades as any other chef.
  For each combination of hot and cold dishes, there is only one possible distribution of grades for each chef.
  Therefore, there are 3 possible grades for each dish, and 3^2=9 possible distributions of grades for each chef.
  There are a total of 9*8=72 possible combinations of hot and cold dishes among the chefs.
  Since each chef has a unique combination of hot and cold dishes, there can be at most 72/9=8 chefs.
  However, not every combination of grades is possible, since each chef must have at least one dish that is higher than Chef B's dish.
  There are 3 possible grades for each dish, so there are 3^2-1=8 possible distributions of grades for each chef that are not worse than Chef B's grades.
  Therefore, there can be at most 8/8=1 chef who meets the condition of being more skilled than Chef B.

  If there are 9 people, then each person's position can be ranked as top grade, middle grade, or bottom grade. So there are 9 positions for hot dishes and 9 positions for cold dishes.
  Each person can only occupy one position for the hot dish, so there are 9 options for the first person, 8 options for the second person, and so on, until the last person has only one option left.
  Similarly, there are 9 options for the first person's cold dish, 8 options for the second person, and so on, until the last person has only one option left.
  Therefore, the total number of options is 9! * 9! = 3,874,204,800.

  According to the conditions, we know the following:
  - There are no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  - If each result of Chef A is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that ""Chef A is more skilled than Chef B"".
  - No one is more skilled than the others.
  
  We can start by considering the maximum number of chefs that can exist in this situation. Suppose there are three hot dishes and three cold dishes, then each dish can be assigned to three different chefs. Therefore, there are 9 chefs in total.
  
  However, based on the conditions, no two people can have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, which means that we need to subtract the number of chefs who have the same hot and cold dishes as other chefs. Since there are three hot dishes and three cold dishes, there are 3 x 2 = 6 possible combinations of hot and cold dishes. Therefore, there can be at most 6 chefs with unique combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  
  Additionally, since no one is more skilled than the others, there can be at most one chef for each possible grade (top, middle, bottom) for both hot and cold dishes. Therefore, there can be at most 3 chefs with unique combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  
  Since 3 is less than 6, we can conclude that there are at most 3 chefs who can meet the above conditions.

  The question implies that there are multiple chefs, and each chef has a hot and cold dish.
  There are 3 grades: ""top"", ""middle"", and ""bottom"".
  If each of Chef A's results is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, then Chef A is more skilled than Chef B.
  The question does not provide any information on the number of chefs or the number of hot and cold dishes.
  Since no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, there must be at least 18 dishes (9 hot and 9 cold) in total.
  The number of chefs cannot be odd, because each chef must be compared to another chef. If there were an odd number of chefs, then there would be at least one chef who is not being compared to anyone else.
  Therefore, the number of chefs is even.
  Starting with two chefs, the number of chefs can be increased by 2, 4, 6, and so on.
  For example, with 2 chefs, there are 18 possible results (9 for Chef A, 9 for Chef B).
  With 4 chefs, there are 72 possible results (18 for each chef).
  With 6 chefs, there are 252 possible results (42 for each chef).
  With 8 chefs, there are 864 possible results (108 for each chef).
  The number of chefs cannot be greater than 6, because the number of possible results (42) is less than the number of dishes (9).

  There are two dishes per chef, one hot and one cold, so there are two evaluations per chef.
  If there are three grades, a chef can have one of three possible grades for each dish.
  Since no two people have the same hot and cold dishes, there are no identical evaluations between chefs.
  Therefore, each chef has a unique combination of evaluations.
  To determine how many chefs meet the condition, we must consider all possible combinations of evaluations.
  If no two people have the same combination of evaluations, then the number of chefs must be the number of combinations of evaluations.
  The number of combinations of evaluations is 3 possible grades for the hot dish times 3 possible grades for the cold dish, or 3^2 = 9 combinations.
  However, this includes Chef A and Chef B, who are not identical to any other chef, so the number of chefs who can meet the condition is 9 - 2 = 7.

  If no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, and there are ""n"" chefs, there will be C(n, 2) = n! / [(n-2)! * 2!] combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  Since there are 3 grades ""top"", ""middle"", and ""bottom"", each chef has 3 x 3 = 9 evaluation results.
  For Chef A to be more skilled than Chef B, Chef A needs to have at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B, and all other dishes are not lower than Chef B. It means that Chef A has one more top or middle grade than Chef B. 
  Suppose Chef A has one hot dish with a higher grade than Chef B, then Chef A has 1 x 3 = 3 options, and for each option, Chef A has 2 x 3 = 6 options for a cold dish. 
  Hence, there are 3 x 6 = 18 combinations of hot and cold dishes for Chef A to be more skilled than Chef B.
  However, Chef B can also be more skilled than Chef A. Hence, there are 2 x 18 = 36 combinations for each pair of chefs (A, B). 
  To satisfy the requirement that no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, we must have n! / [(n-2)! * 2!] >= 36.

  Therefore, option C, which describes the relationship between demand and total income if demand is elastic, can be inferred to be true.
  The other options are not necessarily true based on the given information.

  Elastic demand refers to the situation where the percentage change in demand is greater than the percentage change in price.

  In 2007, although the tuition fees decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006. This means that the demand for W University is elastic.
  To answer the question, we need to find out which statement must be true.
  Statement A contradicts the original statement because it says that if changes in prices result in changes in total income and prices in the same direction, then demand is elastic. But we know that demand is elastic when the price change causes the total income and price to reverse.
  Statement B is irrelevant to the original statement because we don't have any information about economic benefits.
  Statement C is true according to the original statement. It says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices. But we know that the original statement says the opposite.
  Statement D is also irrelevant to the original statement. We don't have any information about enrollment growth.

  We can start by making a diagram to represent the conditions.
  From condition 1, we know that G is stored in warehouse 5 or 6. 
  From condition 2, we know that L is stored in warehouse 4, 5 or 6. 
  From condition 3, we know that P is stored in warehouse 4, 5 or 6. 
  From condition 4, we know that T is stored in warehouse 2 or 3. 
  We can also infer that F is stored in warehouse 1.
  Now we can use this information to eliminate the false statement.
  A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M - There is no mention of where M is stored, so this could be true. 
  B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M - If G is stored in warehouse 5, then this is true. 
  C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L - If P is stored in warehouse 6, and L is stored in warehouse 4, then this is false.
  D: The warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F - If L is stored in warehouse 6, and F is stored in warehouse 1, then this is false.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
  However, since the question asks which statement ""must"" be false, we know that the answer is C, because statement C can never be true, while statement D can be true in some cases.

  We can use the given information to create a diagram of the six warehouses with the letter representing the type of goods stored in that warehouse.
  F cannot be in warehouse 1 because P is in a warehouse that is larger in number than F. Therefore, F must be in warehouse 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Since T is next to P, T cannot be in warehouse 1 or 6. Therefore, T must be in warehouse 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  Since L is in a warehouse larger than T, L cannot be in warehouse 5 or 6. Therefore, L must be in warehouse 3 or 4.
  Since G is in a warehouse larger than L, G cannot be in warehouse 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, G must be in warehouse 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, M must be in the remaining warehouse.
  A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M. This can be true since F can be in warehouses 3 or 4, and M can be in warehouse 5. Therefore, A is not false.
  B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M. This can be true since G can be in warehouse 4 and M can be in warehouse 5. Therefore, B is not false.
  C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L. This is false since L can only be in warehouses 3 and 4, and P can only be in warehouses 5 and 6. Therefore, C is the answer.

  From condition (2), we know that T must be stored in warehouse 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  From condition (3), we know that P must be stored in warehouse 5 or 6, and F must be stored in warehouse 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  From condition (4), we know that T and P are next to each other, so T must be in warehouse 3 or 4, and P must be in warehouse 4, or 5.
  We can use this chart to check each of the answer choices:
  
  A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M
    According to the chart, F can be in warehouse 1, 2, 3, or 4, and M can be in warehouse 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    They can be next to each other if F is in warehouse 2 and M is in warehouse 3, or if F is in warehouse 3 and M is in warehouse 4.
    Therefore, this statement can be true and is not necessarily false.
    
  B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M
    According to the chart, G can be in warehouse 5 or 6, and M can be in warehouse 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    They can be next to each other if G is in warehouse 5 and M is in warehouse 6.
    Therefore, this statement can be true and is not necessarily false.
    
  C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L
    According to the chart, P can be in warehouse 4 or 5, and L must be in warehouse 4, 5, or 6.
    They can be next to each other if P is in warehouse 4 and L is in warehouse 5, or if P is in warehouse 5 and L is in warehouse 6.

The politician is arguing that under the leadership of their party, the prices of commodities are getting lower and lower.
The evidence used to support this argument is that their party successfully reduced the increase in CPI from 4% to 1.5% while the opposition party's CPI rose by more than 4%.
The argument is vulnerable to criticisms that:
- A: It did not elaborate on the opposition party's proposition, but simply ignored it. However, the opposition party's CPI data was mentioned as evidence to support the argument.
- B: The evidence used to support this conclusion actually negates this conclusion and provides more support. This is not true because the evidence supports the argument that under the leadership of the politician's party, the prices of commodities are getting lower and lower.
- C: It was not mentioned that the opposition party was in a period of overheating in the domestic economy, but now there is an economic crisis in Europe and the United States. However, this information is not relevant to the argument presented by the politician.

  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Therefore, if J and K are children and are assigned to the same doctor, then the doctor must be responsible for treating an adult patient of the same sex as J or K.
  Since each doctor is responsible for treating up to two patients, it is impossible for any doctor to treat both J and K.

  Dr.Liu can be responsible for treating at most 2 patients.
  Since Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, Dr.Li can't be responsible for treating any child patient. Hence J and K must be treated by a doctor other than Dr.Li.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Dr.Zhang will treat E and F, and Dr.Li will treat G. Hence J and K must be treated by Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu, but we can't determine which child patient will be treated by which doctor.
  Therefore, it must be true that Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient, and Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient.

  Among the patients, J and K are children.
  Therefore, both Dr.Zhang and Dr.Li cannot treat J and K.
  Since Dr.Li can only treat one patient, he cannot treat an adult patient as well as a child patient of the same sex as the child.
  Therefore, Dr.Li must treat an adult patient of the opposite sex as the child.

  We need to consider the given conditions to determine which option must be true.
  Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients. This means that E, F, and J can only be treated by Dr. Zhang.
  Dr. Li can only treat one patient. Therefore, Dr. Li can treat any one of the remaining 4 females (G or H) or one of the child patients (J or K).
  If a doctor is responsible for a child patient, he must treat an adult patient of the same sex as the child. This means that if a doctor is responsible for treating a child female, he must also be responsible for treating an adult female, and if a doctor is responsible for treating a child male, he must also be responsible for treating an adult male.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Dr. Wang must be responsible for treating at least one male patient and one female patient since Dr. Zhang can only treat male patients and Dr. Li can only treat one patient, which could be a female patient.
  This also means that Dr. Wang cannot be responsible for treating a child patient since there is no adult patient of the same sex as the child to pair with. Therefore, option B and D are not correct.
  Since Dr. Zhang is only responsible for treating male patients, Dr. Liu must treat the remaining female patients.

  J and K are child patients.
  E, F, and J are male patients.
  Therefore, Dr. Zhang is responsible for treating E, F, and J.
  Dr. Li can only treat one patient, which can be either G, H, or I.
  If Dr. Li is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Therefore, Dr. Li cannot treat J or K.
  Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu must treat K and G. Since Dr. Li cannot treat J or K, Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu must treat J and K. Therefore, Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu are responsible for treating at least one child patient.
  Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu are responsible for treating at most two patients each. Therefore, Dr. Wang must treat at least one female patient, and Dr. Liu must treat at least one male patient.

- The total number of patients is 7, and each doctor can treat no more than 2 patients. This means that at least one doctor must treat only one patient.
- Condition (1) states that Dr. Zhang only treats male patients, which means that he cannot treat J and K, the two child patients.
- According to condition (3), if a doctor treats a child, he/she must also treat an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
- If Dr. Li treats only one patient, then this patient cannot be J or K.
- We need to determine which doctor is responsible for treating which patient.
- The remaining patients after Dr. Zhang and Dr. Li have been assigned must be assigned to Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu.
- Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu each have two patients to treat, which means that each must treat at least one adult and one child.

Actions: 
- We can eliminate option B since Dr. Zhang is responsible for treating only male patients and cannot treat the child patients J and K.
- Dr. Li can only treat one patient, so that patient cannot be J or K. Therefore, Dr. Li must treat an adult patient. This means that Dr. Li cannot treat any of the female patients E, F, or G, since there would then be no male doctor available to treat the remaining male patients. Therefore, Dr. Li must treat either H or I, both of whom are male.
- Dr. Zhang must treat E and F, the two remaining male patients.
- According to condition (3), if a doctor treats a child, then he/she must also treat an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Therefore, Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu each must treat one adult and one child patient, both of the same sex.
- We can eliminate option D since we do not know whether Dr. Liu is responsible for treating a child patient.
- Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu each must treat at least one female patient since there are four female patients remaining (E, F, G, and H). Therefore, option A must be true.
- Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu each must also treat at least one child patient since there are two child patients remaining (J and K). Therefore, option B must also be true.

  Choice A talks about the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, which implies that there are other means of transportation.
  Choice B talks about the low percentage of international ships entering the Yangtze River above the Nanjing Bridge, which means that the need to dredge the waterways above the bridge may not be as urgent.
  Choice C talks about other bridges in the area with the same clear height of 24 meters, which implies that demolishing and rebuilding the Nanjing Bridge alone may not solve the problem.

  Option A, which suggests that drivers are trying to negotiate a reduction in the monthly rent paid to taxi companies, is irrelevant to the question since it doesn't relate to the drivers' contradictory attitude.

  The previous sentences compare wine to Bancheng Shaoguo, stating that good wine is refined and can be drunk a little.
  The last sentence says that Bancheng Shaoguo can also be drunk a little, implying that it is a good wine.
  To make this a logical inference, we need a premise that establishes that Bancheng Shaoguo is a good wine.
  Therefore, we need to select the premise that states that Bancheng Shaoguo is a good wine.
  Choice C states that Wuliangye and Bancheng Shaojiao are good wines, but we need a premise that specifically identifies Bancheng Shaoguo as a good wine.
  Choice D states that the craft of Bancheng casserole is excellent, which provides evidence that Bancheng Shaoguo is a good wine.

  Option A is not related to Bancheng Shaoguo or good wine in the context.
  Option B talks about time, but doesn't add any information about Bancheng Shaoguo.
  Option C states that Wuliangye and Bancheng Shaojiao are good wines, but doesn't say anything about Bancheng Shaoguo's craft or refinement.

  In the first situation, the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L, so L cannot be in the 4th warehouse. Also, since the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P, T cannot be in the 5th warehouse. Therefore, F and P must be in the 4th and 6th warehouses.

- From condition (2), we know that the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouses 5 or 6.
- From condition (4), we know that the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, T cannot be stored in warehouses 1 or 6.

  - G can be stored in warehouses 3 or 4.
  - M can be stored in warehouses 1, 2, or 3.
- From condition (3), we know that the warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F. Therefore, P cannot be stored in warehouse 1.
- From condition (4), we know that the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, P cannot be stored in warehouse 5.

- From condition (2), we know that the warehouse storing L is larger than the warehouse storing T. Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouse 4, 5, or 6.

- There are two remaining goods that can be stored in warehouses 1 and 3: F and L.

  The statement mentions that the lower the credit rating of the borrower, the higher the cost of borrowing and the higher the rate of return for the creditor, which means investors will demand a higher yield for holding bonds issued by a lower-rated borrower.
  On August 5, 2011, S&P downgraded the US sovereign credit rating from AAA to AA+, which means the credit rating of US government bonds is lower. According to common sense, investors should reduce their holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds and yields should rise.
  However, on August 8, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
  None of the choices can fully explain this violation of common sense, but we should choose the one that offers the best explanation.
  A is irrelevant to the bond market and does not help explain the situation.
  B is true, but it cannot fully explain why investors would buy more Treasury bonds and push their prices up, given the lower credit rating of the US government.
  C is also true, but it does not explain why investors would buy more Treasury bonds.
  D is irrelevant to the bond market and does not help explain the situation.
  Therefore, we can best explain the above-mentioned violation of common sense by choosing the most likely answer, which is B: Compared with the bonds of the European Union, Japan, and other countries, US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products. This may suggest that investors still have confidence in the US government's ability to repay its debts, even with a lower credit rating.

  (2) J cannot be ranked seventh. So, J must be placed before the seventh position.
  X _ _ _ _ _ J
  (3) G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H. This means that if G is in front of H, then H must be in the last three positions. If G is immediately after H, then H must be in the first four positions. Let's consider both cases:
      (i) G is in front of H. Then, H must be in one of the last three positions (5th, 6th or 7th). Let's assume H is in the 5th position.
          X _ _ _ H G _
          Note that H must be in front of L.
          X _ _ H _ G _
          L must be after H.
          X _ _ H L G _
          M must be before J and K.

          Now, K can be placed in the last remaining position.
          X F M H L G K
          So, L is in fourth position, which means statement B (L third) is false.
      (ii) G is immediately after H. Then, H must be in one of the first four positions (1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th). Let's assume H is in the 4th position.
          X _ _ _ H G _

          X _ _ H _ G _
          L must be after H.

          M must be before J and K.

          So, M can be placed in the second position or third position. But, M cannot be placed in the first position because F must be second.

          Now, we can either place J in the last remaining position, or we can place K in the last remaining position. Let's try placing J in the last position.

  According to the condition (1), if H is on duty on a certain day, then J must be on duty the next day.
  According to the condition (2), the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day.
  According to the condition (3), G must be on the same day as one of J and O. Since O is on the third day, G must be on the first or second day. If G is on the first day, then J and O cannot be on the second day. Therefore, G must be on the second day, and J or O must be on the first day.
  According to the condition (4), K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day. 
  Since K has not yet been arranged on the first two days, K must be on the third or fourth day. 
  According to the condition (5), O must be on the third day, so K cannot be on the third day. 
  Therefore, K must be on the fourth day, and L must be on the third day. 
  According to the condition (2), the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, so J and H must be on duty on the first two days. 
  According to the condition (1), if H is on duty on a certain day, then J must be on duty the next day. Therefore, J must be on duty on the third day. 
  According to the condition (3), G must be on the same day as one of J and O. Since J is already on the third day, G must be on the first day and O must be on the second day. 
  Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is K.

  The finance department is on the third floor.
  The planning department is on the second floor.
  The administration department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.
  The sales department is not adjacent to the human resources department.
  Therefore, the sales department is located on either the first floor or the sixth floor, and the human resources department is located on either the fourth floor or the sixth floor.
  If the R & D department is on the fifth floor, there will only be one possible floor left for the human resources department or the sales department to occupy, and this would violate the condition that the two departments are not adjacent.
  If the R & D department is on the upper level of the sales department, the sales department must be on the first floor, which means the human resources department is on the sixth floor, and this would violate the condition that the two departments are not adjacent.
  If the administration department is on the upper level of the planning department, the human resources department must be on the sixth floor, and this would violate the condition that the administration department is below the human resources department.
  If the sales department is on a certain layer above the planning department, this would be consistent with the condition that the two departments are not adjacent.

  We know that the finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, which means the planning department is on the second floor.
  We also know that the administration department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department.
  Since the sales department is not adjacent to the human resources department, it cannot be on the fourth or sixth floor.
  If the sales department is not on the fourth or sixth floor, then it must be on the first or fifth floor.
  If the sales department is on the first floor, then the human resources department must be on the third floor, which is not possible because the sales and human resources departments cannot be adjacent.
  Therefore, the sales department must be on the fifth floor and the human resources department must be on the second floor.
  The administration department is above the planning department, which is on the second floor, so it must be on the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth floor.
  Therefore, the administration department may or may not be on the upper level of the planning department.

  We are given that the finance department is on the 3rd level of the building.
  We are also given that the planning department is on the floor below the administrative department.
  So, the administrative department is on the 4th or 5th floor.
  The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, so the planning department must be on the 2nd floor.
  We know that the human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent.
  Therefore, the human resources department and the sales department must be on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th or 6th floor, but not on the 3rd floor.
  
Action: Answer(""A"")  
Reasoning: Since the R&D department can only be on the 5th or 6th floor, and we are not given any information that would rule out either floor, it is possible for the R&D department to be on the 5th floor. Therefore, the correct answer is A: The R&D department is on the fifth floor.

  According to the information given:
  The finance department is on the next floor of the planning department, which means planning department is on the 2nd floor.
  The administrative department is above the planning department, which means the administrative department is on the 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th floor.
  The human resources department and the sales department are not adjacent. Since there are six floors, there are many possibilities. However, since we know that the finance department is on the third floor, and the planning department is on the second floor, it is impossible for the human resources department and the sales department to be on the second and fourth floors, respectively. Therefore, either the human resources department or the sales department occupies the top floor of the building.
  Therefore,
  A. It is possible that the R&D department is on the fifth floor.
  B. It is not possible for the R&D department to be on the upper level of the sales department. If the sales department is on the sixth floor, then the R&D department is on the fifth floor, which is possible according to the information given. If the sales department is on the fifth floor, then the human resources department is on the sixth floor, which is not possible according to the information given.
  C. It is possible that the administration department is not on the upper level of the planning department.

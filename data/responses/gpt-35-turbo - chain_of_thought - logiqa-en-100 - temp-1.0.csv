The question is asking to negate the given speculation (that there may be living bodies on other planets than the earth, and may even be living bodies with higher intelligence).
The speculation is based on the assumption that amino acids exist in space and can lead to the development of organic life.
Therefore, to refute this speculation, we need to disprove the assumption that amino acids exist in space or can lead to the development of organic life.
Option A is not related to the assumption about amino acids or organic life.
Option B is not a refutation of the assumption that amino acids exist in space or can lead to the development of organic life.
Option D mentions some interstellar molecules that are not found on Earth, but it doesn't disprove the assumption that amino acids exist in space or can lead to the development of organic life.
Option C, which states that the natural synthesis of amino acids from interstellar molecules is a rare event, is the best answer. If it were true, it would suggest that the assumption about the abundance of amino acids in space and the possibility of the development of organic life is incorrect.

  The speculation states that there may be life on other planets based on the existence of raw materials to synthesize amino acids in interstellar molecules.
  To refute this speculation, we need to provide evidence that contradicts the idea of the existence of life based on the presence of raw materials alone.
  Option A is not a valid answer because it talks about a difference between two processes but doesn't provide information that rejects the speculation.  
  Option B is also not a valid answer because it doesn't provide any evidence to counter the speculation.
  Option D is irrelevant because the speculation is only based upon the availability of raw materials to synthesize amino acids in interstellar molecules.
  Option C suggests that the probability of amino acid synthesis is low. This contradicts the speculation that it is easy to imagine that there must also be amino acid molecules in the universe.
  Therefore, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  The speculation is that there could be living bodies on other planets based on the presence of amino acid molecules in space.
  To refute this, we need to provide evidence or a statement that contradicts this speculation.
  Choice A talks about the developing process of protein to organic life which is irrelevant to the speculation mentioned.
  Choice B provides another perspective that higher intelligence is a product of socialization apart from the material evolution, but it still doesn't refute the speculation.
  Choice D mentions some interstellar molecules that are not found in Earth's environment, but still it doesn't refute the speculation mentioned in the statement.
  Choice C states that the probability of synthesizing amino acid molecules in the natural environment is less likely, this opposes the speculation that there must be amino acid molecules in the universe.

  The statement in the passage suggests that there might be living bodies elsewhere in the universe.
  The question asks to refute this statement.
  To refute, we have to provide a statement that says why there is no possibility of having organisms elsewhere in the universe.
  Option A talks about the difference between the processes of developing organic life and protein. It doesn't talk about the existence of life elsewhere.
  Option B talks about the source of intelligence. However, it doesn't provide any information about the existence of life.
  Option C talks about the probability of amino acid synthesis which contradicts the passage. Therefore, it is a contender for the correct answer.
  Option D talks about some molecules that exist in space but not in the laboratory. It doesn't tell us that it is impossible to have living organisms elsewhere.
  
Only option C provides information that contradicts the passage in a way that says it is not likely that there are living things elsewhere. So, the answer is C: In the natural environment, the synthesis of amino acid molecules from existing interstellar molecules is a small probability event.

  We are asked to find the speakers who can be arranged between M and N with lunch in between them. 
  G must speak before lunch.
  We can find the possible orders of the speakers using the given conditions, and check which contain M and N with one person between them.
  We know that F speaks in the first or third place.
  Therefore, the possible configurations are:

  We have two cases to consider:
    Case 1: M is before N:
      1st scenario: M is in the 2nd place, N is in the 5th place:

  From (2), we know that there are only three speakers that speak before lunch, and the other three speak after lunch.
  From (4), we know that only one speaker separates M and N, Therefore either M speaks before N or N speaks before M. Without loss of generality, let's assume that M speaks before N. Then by (2), all three speakers who speak before lunch must speak before M. That means the three speakers that speak before lunch are in the order G, x, and y, where x, y are two other speakers among F, J, L, N. Then by (5), F must be the first speaker. If x is J or L, then y cannot be N because only one speaker separates M and N. Therefore y must be N. The only possibility is x is J and y is N. So the order before lunch is G, J, N, and the order after lunch is F, M, L. The only speakers between M and N are J and L. Thus, the answer is B: J, L.

  1. If X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment.
        This could be rephrased as: ""If W is not L accompaniment, then X is not F accompaniment.""
  2. If X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment.

  4. F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.
    
  Let's analyze each choice:
  A. G and H
    If Y is an H accompaniment, X must be a G accompaniment from the second condition. But F and G do not share accompaniment, so X cannot be a G accompaniment. Therefore, Y cannot accompany G and H together.
    
  B. L and H
    If we know that Y is an H accompaniment, then X cannot be F accompaniment from the first known condition. Let's see what we can infer from here. 
      - If X is not G accompaniment, then Y is M accompaniment from the second known condition.
      - In this case, W has to accompany F, because if W is L accompaniment, X cannot be F accompaniment by the first known condition.
      - But then Y cannot accompany L and K, because Y has to accompany H from the third known condition.
    Therefore, Y cannot accompany L and H together.
    
  C. F and L
    If Y is L accompaniment, then X has to be G accompaniment because of the second known condition. But W cannot accompany F because the first known condition says that W is L accompaniment if X is F accompaniment. Therefore, Y cannot accompany F and L together.

  The question is asking for the hypothesis on which student representative L’s complaint relies.
  The information provided is saying the representative thinks all students admitted to the school are accredited by the school and the Business School entrance examination required an IELTS score of 7 points, which all students have achieved.
  The statement in line with the hypothesis would be about the requirement for entry into the school and how student performance post-enrollment does not match up to the expected level set for entry into the school.
  Thus, the hypothesis on which the student representative's complaint relies is: C-The school's requirements for students' English language entry are the same as those required for completion of all subjects after enrollment.

  The conclusion is that the cost of health care has increased but medical conditions have greatly improved.
  Statement A suggests that most of the health care costs are spent on high-risk patients which raises the question whether there should be a different focus on spending healthcare funds.
  Statement B is supportive of the conclusion.
  Statement C is irrelevant to the conclusion and doesn't question it.

  Choice C is about the allocation of money rather than healthcare.
  Choice D confirms the need for increased healthcare spending.

  The statement suggests that insurance companies are competing for strong insurance business, despite suffering losses for most of the years since its launch in 2006.
  To explain this strange phenomenon, we need to look for a possible reason why this particular type of insurance is still attractive.
  Option A is not directly related to the phenomenon, and also does not provide any explanation.
  Option B suggests that there might be irregularities in the payment process, but it does not clarify why strong insurance business is still being pursued.
  Option C talks about tractors being registered as transport vehicles, which might lead to low tax rates, but it does not provide any direct explanation for insurance companies competing for strong insurance business.
  Option D suggests that commercial auto insurance is lucrative, and this might be one possible reason why car owners choose not to insure compulsory insurance separately. This might lead insurance companies to compete for strong insurance business, despite the losses.

  No two people can have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Each person can have 1 of 3 possible grades for each of their dishes, giving 9 possible outcomes for each person.
  Chef A is considered more skilled than Chef B if Chef A has at least one dish with a higher grade than Chef B and all of Chef A's grades are not lower than Chef B's grades.
  Therefore, each chef can only be considered more skilled than up to half of the other chefs.
  If any two chefs have the same set of dishes, then one of them cannot be considered more skilled than the other (since they cannot have any dishes with higher grades than the other).
  Thus, in order for all chefs to be considered equally skilled, there must be at least two chefs for each unique combination of hot and cold dishes and grades.
  There are 3 possible grades for each of the 2 dishes, giving 9 unique combinations in total.

  The condition states that ""If each result of the chef is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that 'Chef A is more skilled than Chef B'"". This means that for any two chefs, there must be at least one dish that Chef A does better than Chef B. As a result, no two chefs' performance can be exactly the same.

  The k-th chef (k < n) can make 1 out of (n-k choose 2) + 1 hot dishes and 1 out of (n-k choose 2) + 1 cold dishes.
  If n is the total number of chefs, then for each chef, there are (n-2 choose 2) ways to be not better or worse than Chef A, and one way to be worse than Chef A. Because no two chefs have the same dishes, the evaluation of Chef B can be considered as one of the combinations of (n-2 choose 2) ways to be not better nor worse than Chef A. Thus, for each Chef A, there is only one Chef B.

   - To say that Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, the result of Chef A should be overall higher than Chef B's, including at least one higher grade than Chef B. 
  In a hot and cold dish combination, there are 2! = 2 different dishes Chef A can choose from.
  Since no two people have the same combination, we only need to consider for how many distinct dish combinations we can rank them.
  Starting from the worst grade, there are 6 different possibilities for the worst graded chef's hot-cold dish combination. After this, there are 4 different possibilities for the dish combination of the middle chef and 2 different possibilities for the top chef.

  Each chef can be the top-graded chef for 8 of these combinations (since they're distinct combinations and they all have equal probability).

  If no two people have the same hot and cold dishes, then the number of people must be equal to the number of possible unique combinations of hot and cold dishes.

  Since no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, the total number of combinations for those dishes is unique for each chef and can be represented as C(n,2), where n is the number of dishes.
  Since the total number of unique dish combinations is different among each chef and no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, there are no chefs with the same evaluation results.
  From the statement ""none of them is more skilled than the other"", it means that every combination of entries shows a draw.
  Assume that there are 3 chefs, named A, B, and C. For convenience, let's assume that chef B always gets the worst grade and chef C always gets the middle grade.
  Then, Chef B gets the bottom grade in all comparisons, and Chef C reads the following chart.

 | chef A grade |  Grade                         |
 | ------------ |-------------------------------|
 |  Top grade   |        1 draw, 1 win           |

 |  Bot grade   |        1 draw, 1 loss           |

 Now, assume that there is a chef D. We have two cases to consider.
  - If chef D always gets a better score than Chef C, Chef D wins more than Chef C and becomes the new Chef C. 
  - If Chef D fails to obtain a value higher than the middle grade, Chef D becomes Chef B because Chef B scores lower than Chef C, and every other entry has been filled in.
  As a result, 3 people are unable to satisfy the requirements to be selected as one of the most skilled chefs.
  Continuing, we'll apply the same rule to the remaining chefs: a new chef is inserted between the best chef and the middle chef, and a chef B is inserted at the bottom. Since there are three chefs and two spaces (between the best chef and the middle chef, and between the middle chef and the worst chef) to insert other chefs, all possible combinations are as follows:
  1) A>C>B, 2) A>B>C, 3) C>A>B, 4) B>A>C, 5) C>B>A, 6) B>C>A

  Option A talks about reemployment opportunities and delayed purchases which does not address the question whether unemployed people will have money to buy non-necessity goods when prices are low.
  Option B does not provide any information on the situation where unemployed people will be able to buy non-necessity goods even in deteriorating economic conditions.
  Option C says unemployed people have to buy necessities like food, but it does not provide information on whether they can buy non-necessity goods or not.
  Option D suggests that unemployed people compress expenditures even when the economy is deteriorating and they have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.
  Therefore, Option D best weakens Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang.

  Li Ming's argument is that if people are unemployed, they won't be able to increase their consumption, even if prices fall to the lowest point.
  We need to choose an answer choice that contradicts Li Ming's argument that even when prices fall to the lowest point, it will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  Choice A and B don't directly affect Li Ming's argument.
  Choice C actually supports Li Ming's argument since necessities like food will be prioritized over other goods.
  Choice D mentions that even during the period of economic deterioration, people compress expenditures, and when prices fall to the lowest point, they will have savings for consumption. This weakens Li Ming's argument that falling prices to the lowest point won't lead to an improvement in economic conditions.

  3) K must be arranged before J and S 
  4) F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks

  The question is asking us to identify the statement that most seriously shakes the traditional view of the origin of the Gua name.
  The passage suggests that the traditional view is that there is no meaning behind the names of the Gua in Zhouyi and that the names are either fictional or named after an object.
  Statement A mentions that the reason why Qiankun is at the top of the sixty-four hexagrams is because Qian represents heaven and Kun represents earth.This statement doesn't shake the traditional view as it does not offer any new explanation for the origin of the Gua name.
  Statement B suggests that both the orientation theory and the sense of meaning theory are needed to explain the Gua names, shaking the traditional view that there is no meaning behind the names.
  Statement C mentions that there are different explanations for the origin of the names, but they are attributed to the theory of fetching images or theories of fetching meanings without offering new insight.
  Statement D provides a new story and explanation for the origin of Kun Gua, but it does not challenge the traditional view that the names are fictional.

From condition (3), we deduce that warehouse for P must occur later in the order than that for F. From condition (4), we know that T is next to P.

    (3) The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F.

  If T is at warehouse 5, then P must be at warehouse 6, and F can only be at warehouse 4. 
  L must be at a larger warehouse number than T, so L and T cannot be at warehouses 2 and 5 respectively. This means T is at warehouse 2, P is at warehouse 3, and F is at warehouse 1. This also means G is at warehouse 6. And L must be at warehouse 5.

  P is in a warehouse with a larger number than F. So, P can be in warehouses 5th or 6th and F can be in warehouses 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  T and P are next to each other. Hence, T and P should be in warehouses 4th and 5th or warehouses 5th and 6th. 
  Warehouse 1 and 2 are vacant. There are no vacant warehouses other than warehouses 1 and 2 which can be adjacent to warehouses F and M.
  Thus, the fourth warehouse stores L or T. If L is placed in the 4th warehouse, the fifth warehouse must store P, which is not possible because P can be in warehouses 5th or 6th. Therefore T must be placed in the 4th warehouse. P will then go to the 5th warehouse. The 6th warehouse will store G.

  B.  The warehouse storing G is adjacent to the warehouse storing L since they both are placed in even numbered warehouses, 2nd and 4th; the only remaining even numbered warehouse is the 6th, where T is placed; therefore, G must be next to M.

  Subcommittees consist of 3 different members. So, there must be at least two subcommittees required, and two members from each subcommittee.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three subcommittees, thus, we know that this person is the only one who is common in all subcommittees.
  F and G are not members of the same subcommittee.
  H and I are not members of the same subcommittee.
  We know that the remaining member is either M or P and we can't say anything because there are multiple possibilities. Hence, statement A can't be true.
  Since F and G are not members of the same subcommittee, both must have joined two different subcommittees, which means H must be a member of the third subcommittee. Statement B must be true.
  Since there are only three subcommittees, G and I must belong to the last subcommittee. Statement C must be true.

  There are three subcommittees and each subcommittee requires three members that are unique.
  One of the six committee members must be in all three subcommittees.
  It is known that F is not in the same subcommittee as G and H is not in the same subcommittee as I.
  It is not straightforward to determine whether any of the three committees contains one or two of the members that are excluded from each other's subcommittees.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that at least one member serves in at least one subcommittee, which is stated in choice D: 1 member of any sub-committee.
Action: Answer(""D"")

gpt-35-turbo,chain_of_thought,logiqa-en-100,1.0,29,9,"Thought: 
  There are three sub-committees, and each sub-committee has three different members. So, 3*3=9 members would be required for each member to be a part of exactly one sub-committee.
  However, there are only 6 members, and one of them is part of all three sub-committees. So, the other 5 members need to be split among two sub-committees.
  
  F is not a member of the same sub-committee as G. So, assuming that F is part of all the three sub-committees, G must be a member of both sub-committees that do not contain F. Therefore, G must be in the same sub-committee as either H, I, M or P.
  
  H is not a member of the same sub-committee as I. So, assuming that H is part of all three sub-committees, I must be a member of both sub-committees that do not contain H. Therefore, I must be in the same sub-committee as either F, G, M or P.
  
  Based on the above information, we can infer that M and P cannot be in the same sub-committee, as that would leave only two members (F, G or I) for the third sub-committee. So, either M or P need to be in the same sub-committee as G, and the other needs to be in the same sub-committee as I.
  
  So, using the above logic:
  1. A and B cannot both be true, as F and H cannot be in the same sub-committee.
  2. C must be true. G and I are in the same sub-committee, as they cannot be in the same sub-committee as F, H, M or P.
  3. D is not true, as we already know that one member is part of all three sub-committees.
  
  Therefore, the answer is C: G and I are members of a subcommittee.

  Choice A suggests that Japan is testing China's response by announcing their plan, which may be a possible reason but does not explain why Japan would expose their weakness.
  Choice B talks about Huangyan Island but does not explain how Japan exposing their weaknesses is related to this issue.
  Choice C suggests that Japan wants to build public support for the construction of amphibious warships, but it does not explain why Japan would expose their weaknesses to achieve this goal.
  Choice D argues that Japan wants to emphasize their reliance on the US for military protection. This explanation makes sense as Japan has a military alliance with the US, and the announcement of their weakness may prompt the US to increase military support. This counterintuitive practice may be seen as a complementary move to other diplomatic maneuvers, such as negotiations with the US on military matters.

  The first thing we need to do is to follow the given conditions.
  (1) L and P must be on duty on the same day.
  (2) G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.
  (3) If K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty.
  (4) If S is on the third day of duty, then H is on the second day of duty.
  Let's try to form different combinations according to the given conditions.
    1st day   |  2nd day  |  3rd day 
    LP          GK            HS       (Condition 1, Condition 3 and Condition 4 satisfy)
    PL          KG            HS       (Condition 1, Condition 3 and Condition 4 satisfy)
  The combination GL cannot be formed given that G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.
  Next, we try to form a combination according to the question Stem.
  If H is on duty the same day before S, that means since there must be two people per day H should be either on the first day with L or on the second day with G and K. It cannot be on the third day since S is already on the third day of duty (Condition 4)
  Combinations on the 1st day and 2nd day would be as follows:
  1st day   |  2nd day  |  3rd day
  __________|__________|______
   HP         |   GK         |   LS      (Condition 1, Condition 3 and Condition 4 satisfies)

   HK         |   PG         |   LS      (Condition 1 and Condition 4 satisfy, G and H are on different days)
   KL         |   PG         |   HS      (Condition 1 and Condition 3 satisfy, G and H are on different days)

  Option C is about children gradually losing the nature of playing due to excessive learning pressure and immersion in study. There is no evidence for this in the scenario. It is also not related to whether the children told the truth or not.
  Option D is about the natural love for playing for children. The hypothesis statement assumes that children who have a natural love for playing will always prioritize playing over writing homework. 
  Therefore, the hypothesis on which this parent 's inference relies is that children's love for playing means that no child can express "" willing to write homework"" truthfully while only 12% think that ""writing homework occupies a lot of playing time"".
  The answer is D: Compared with writing homework, children who love to play by nature prefer to play, and writing homework will definitely reduce their playing time.

  The question is asking for a choice that doesn't fit an explanation of the inconsistencies between the energy consumption increase and economic growth rate.
  (A) and (B) may be plausible explanations for inconsistencies because they refer to possible situations of underreporting or missing data.
  (C) suggests the economic slowdown of state-owned enterprises with high energy consumption. Given the high consumption they would have contributed to the overall energy-consumption figures, which contradicts the stated 30% increase.
  (D) is consistent with the economic growth rate being much less than the increase in energy consumption because it refers to newly invested low-energy enterprises.

  The examples given show how foreign companies have acquired Chinese companies and have either taken controlling stakes or become the exclusive owners.
  Therefore, the discussion may be implying that the introduction of foreign capital on preferential terms has led to Chinese companies losing control of their own assets.
  Option A may be a plausible choice because it presents a possible negative outcome of the introduction of foreign capital.
  Option B may also be a correct answer as it presents an opposing view and suggests that the main goal of introducing foreign capital is to introduce advanced technology and management.
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the introduction of foreign capital is due to a lack of funds, which is not given as a reason in the discussion.

  The statement being contradicted is ""Professional scammers prefer to use low-quality scam messages instead of designing more deceptive and more foolish text messages, which only shows that the scammers are too stupid and too undedicated.""
  
  A: This statement assumes that the liar must be smart to deceive others. However, it does not provide any evidence that contradicts the given statement, so this is not the answer.

  B: This statement talks about a scammer's desire to avoid police attention when swindling, but it does not provide any evidence that contradicts the given statement, so this is not the answer.

  C: This statement is about the elimination of ineffective scams. It does not provide any evidence that contradicts the given statement, so this is not the answer.

  D: This statement contradicts the given statement by providing an alternative explanation. It suggests that scammers may use low-quality text messages to ""catch"" people who might be fooled and filter out smart people from the beginning.

  The conclusion is that professional scammers use unsophisticated messages because they are too stupid and too undedicated. 
  The argument is based on the idea that a professional, someone who is dedicated, would make more effort to design more deceptive and more foolish text messages. 
  So, a statement that strongly refutes this conclusion would provide another reason that professional scammers use unsophisticated messages.
  A states that ""The liar must be smart, otherwise it is impossible to deceive others."" It does not provide any alternative explanation to the one given in the conclusion, and hence can be eliminated.
  D states that ""Scammers use such text messages to ""catch"" people who might be fooled. They want to filter out smart people from the beginning."" This explains an alternate reason why professional scammers use unsophisticated messages as it helps in filtering out smart people from getting trapped.

- It could be possible that Dr.Wang gets assigned two male patients, so A can be false.
- According to the constraints, Dr.Wang can not get assigned child patients (as he has to treat at least one female patient), so B can be false.
- Since there are only 3 male patients and Dr.Zhang is responsible for treating males, another doctor must be responsible for treating at least 1 male patient. Therefore, C must be true.

  Dr.Zhang only treats male patients. So E, F, and J cannot be assigned to other doctors.
  Dr.Li is responsible for only one patient which means that Dr.Li cannot be assigned to J or K.
  Child patients J and K must be assigned to the same doctor as an adult of the same sex.
  From (1), Dr. Zhang has to be responsible for either E or F.
  From (2), Dr. Li should not be responsible for J and K since he can only treat one patient.
  Therefore, Dr. Li is responsible for one of the adult patients, H, I, or G, who is not assigned to Dr. Zhang.
  So only Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu can take care of J and K.
  From (3), if Dr. Wang or Dr. Liu is assigned to J or K, then either E or F must be assigned to Dr. Wang or Dr. Liu as well, who is female because J and K are children.
  Therefore, Dr. Wang has to take care of J and an adult female patient, while Dr. Liu has to take care of K and an adult male patient.

  Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.
  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
  J and K are the two child patients, which means the two doctors assigned to them must have 1 adult patient of the same sex to treat.
  There are only 3 male adult patients, so the third male adult patient must be assigned to a doctor who is also treating J or K.
  There are only 4 female patients, so there are more patients to assign to doctors than there are female patients.
  Dr. Wang or Dr. Liu must treat an adult male patient and an adult female patient.
  Based on this logic, the given conditions are not sufficient to confirm Dr. Wang's or Dr. Liu's patients.

- It is not known which patients are assigned to which doctors.
- Dr. Wang must treat at least one adult, but we don't know if it's a male or female.
- Dr. Li only treats one patient, so it can't be a child since all child cases must have paired adults.
- Dr. Liu must treat at least one male since Dr. Zhang already treats some males.
- Dr. Liu cannot treat any children since Dr. Liu must treat at least one male, and there are no child cases that are male.
- Therefore, Dr. Liu must treat an adult male.
- Since Dr. Wang is the only doctor left and Dr. Li is treating only one case, he must treat at least 2 cases assigned to Dr. Wang. 
- Therefore, Dr. Wang must take at least two cases assigned from {E, F, G, H, I, J, K} that are adults of unknown gender.

  J and K are child patients.

  Since E, F, and J are males, Dr. Zhang can be responsible for treating E and J or F and J.
  Dr. Li can be responsible for treating either G, H, I, or K.
  Only adult patients, other than J and K are available for Dr.Li to treat.

- Since there are only two child patients, only two doctors can have a patient of the opposite sex of J and K.
- Since Dr. Zhang is the only one that can treat male patients, he must treat two and the remaining two doctors must treat one each.
- If Dr. Wang treats only one patient, then that patient must be female. If Dr. Liu treats only one patient, then that patient must be male.
- Since Dr. Zhang can only treat E and F, and Dr. Li can't treat any of the children, Dr. Wang must treat one of the children.

- J and K are children, so they must be treated by the same doctor.
- Since E and F are males, and a child patient is involved, the doctor responsible for J and K's treatment must be a male doctor responsible for treating J and an adult male patient.
- So, either Dr.Wang or Dr.Liu must be responsible for treating J and an adult male patient.
- Now, Dr.Zhang is responsible for three male patients. Thus, Dr.Li, Dr.Wang, and Dr.Liu must be responsible for four patients.

   Option A indicates that a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway. 
   This statement indicates that the bridge's presence hinders the movement of large ships through the golden waterway of the Yangtze River.
   Hence, this option is not the correct answer.
   Option B indicates that 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, indicating that large external ships do not frequently travel above Nanjing.

  The expert argues that Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt.
  We need to find an option that would make one doubt the expert's point of view.
  (A) suggests that because large ships can't pass through the bridge, many goods have to be transported by other means, which could lead to considerable inconveniences and costs.
  (B) suggests that most ships coming to the Yangtze River pass the Nanjing Bridge and seldom travel upstream of the bridge.
  (C) suggests that even if the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge is dismantled and rebuilt, the other bridges’ heights remain below the required clear height, suggesting that the solution is not complete and would require the rebuilding of other bridges as well.
  (D) suggests that even without rebuilding the Nanjing bridge, large ships have successfully navigated through, indicating that the clearing of the bridge may not be the only factor impacting ship passage.
  Option (B) presents a perspective that does not directly challenge the expert's point of view or insist on not rebuilding the bridge. However, by providing an alternative perspective on the frequency of shipping around the region of the bridge, it may raise some doubts about the necessity of completely rebuilding the bridge. Option (C) also provides a point to be considered. Although it does not undermine the need to clear the bridge, it challenges the completeness of the solution presented. Option (A) and (D) do not necessarly challenge the need to rebuild the bridge.

  Option A states that the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge forces 
  a large number of exported goods to be transported by road or railway.
  Option B states that very few foreign ships come above the Nanjing Bridge.
  Option C states that there are other bridges apart from the Nanjing Bridge that have a 
  clear height of 24 meters, which could become a hindrance for large ships.
  Option D states that shipbuilding technology has advanced so that 8000-ton ships can 
  adapt to the passage of the Yangtze River without the need for the Nanjing Bridge to be demolished.
  Option B raises the most doubts about the expert's point of view.
  If very few foreign trade terminals above Nanjing receive large foreign ships, then 
  there may not be a lot of urgency to demolish and rebuild the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge.

Action: Answer(""C"")  
  Explanation: None of the premises by itself would be enough to logically lead one to infer that Bancheng Shaoguo wine is good. However, premise C states that Wuliangye and Bancheng Shaojiao are good wines, which includes Bancheng Shaoguo wine as part of what the advertisers define as ""good.""

  Since K and L are members of both groups, according to condition (5), we know that at least one employee is shared by both groups. Thus, G cannot be the third member of the printing group, so G is in the binding group.

In that case, J must also be in this group since they are both in the same group; this group needs at least three members, which means the last member must be one of F, G, H, or M (excluding L).

  We can list all possible placements for M and G and then check which cases match the conditions given.
  If we get multiple valid placements for M and G, then we need to check the other conditions to get a unique solution.
  
  Possible placements for M and G (MG):
    (1) MG in warehouses 1 and 3.

    (3) MG in warehouses 3 and 5.
    (4) MG in warehouses 4 and 6.

    The only option that has the warehouse for P larger than the warehouse for F is option (3).

      (1) LT in warehouses 1 and 3.
      (2) LT in warehouses 2 and 4.
      (3) LT in warehouses 3 and 5.

The first step is to find all possible cases.
Case 1: G is in warehouse 4, L is in warehouse 3, T is in warehouse 2, and F is in warehouse 1. Then, since G and M are separated by exactly one warehouse, M has to be in warehouse 5. Now, P can only be in warehouse 6.
Therefore, there are only four kinds of goods in the warehouse, which are G, L, M, and P.
Case 2: G is in warehouse 5, P is in warehouse 6. From this, we can infer that T is in warehouse 4. Otherwise, the condition of T and P being adjacent wouldn't be met. From the conditions given, it can also be inferred that L can only be in warehouse 3 or 2. If L is in warehouse 2, then M must be in warehouse 1. But if M is in warehouse 1, then G and M won’t be separated by only one warehouse. Therefore, we put L in warehouse 3.

The argument relates external symbols to inner events and suggests that when others have the same external symbols, they share the same inner activity events. To support this argument, we need a choice that relates external symbols and inner events or behavior and inner activity events.
Option A suggests that similar results have similar reasons, which may not be related to the argument in question. Option D states that people are similar in many ways, but this does not provide a direct connection between behavior and inner activities.
Option B suggests a close connection between pain and the external symbols of moaning and face twisting, which can support the argument that when others have the same external symbols, they share the same internal experiences.
Option C relates behavioral and inner activities and can support the argument. However, it is not as strong as Option B, which directly relates the external symbols and inner events.

  The statement mentions that investors should reduce their holdings of US Treasury bonds when they are in a safe haven, thereby pushing their prices down and yields rising.
  But on August 8, 2011, the price of US Treasury Bonds rose and the yield fell.
  We need to find the most reasonable explanation for the above-mentioned violation of common sense.
  Option A and Option D do not provide any reasonable explanations for the violation of common sense.
  Option C is also not relevant here as it mentions only about the countries reducing or increasing their holdings of US Treasury bonds.
  Option B provides the best explanation that though the US sovereign credit rating was lowered,    US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investments as compared to bonds of the European Union, Japan, and other countries. So, the violation of the expected behavior of the bonds can be attributed to this fact.

  The common sense suggests that if the credit rating of the US is lowered, the price of the US Treasury bonds will decrease and their yields will increase.
  However, on August 8, the price of US Treasury bonds rose, and the yield fell, and the yield of the latest 10-year US Treasury bond fell to 2.34%, a new low this year.
  We need to explain why the price of US Treasury bonds rose despite the downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating.
  Option A is regarding a calculation error and does not explain the mentioned violation of common sense.
  Option B suggests the US Treasury bonds are still safer than other bonds in the market. However, it is unclear how this fact can explain the violation of common sense mentioned in the scenario.
  Option C includes information about China increasing its holdings of US Treasury bonds and Russia reducing its holdings, but it does not explain the mentioned violation of common sense.
  Option D is about the EU planning to establish a European credit rating agency, which has no apparent correlation with the inconsistent movement of US Treasury bonds on August 8.

  Option A talks about S&P's error in the rating calculations, but it doesn't explain the violation of common sense.
  Option B supports the idea that US Treasuries are still safe and liquid investment products, but doesn't explain why the prices rose and yield fell.
  Option C talks about other countries' holdings of US Treasury bonds, but doesn't explain the violation of common sense either.

  The common sense states that the yield of a treasury bond should increase and its price should decrease if the credit rating of the borrower is downgraded.
  However, on August 8, 2011, the price of US Treasury bonds rose and the yield fell, which is violating common sense.

  Statement A is irrelevant to this situation as it was released on August 5, while the paradoxical situation was observed on August 8.
  Statement B is indicating that US Treasuries are still relatively safe and liquid investment products compared to other countries' bonds, which could increase the demand for US Treasuries, hence, lowering the yield.
  Statement C provides information on the action taken by Russia and China regarding their holdings of US Treasury bonds. This is not directly relevant to the paradoxical situation and does not necessarily explain it.

    (2) J cannot be ranked seventh. Therefore, M must be ranked seventh, so J can be ranked some other position before seventh.
    (3) G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H. Therefore, G must be ranked either before two positions before H or two positions after H.
    (4) H must be somewhere in front of L. Therefore, H cannot be ranked seventh, it is some other position before the seventh position.

B is not correct because it discusses Nanyang University, which is not the university mentioned in the original assertion.
C is not correct because it introduces no new concept but implies that not all undergraduates with recommended qualifications may enter Beijing University for a master’s degree.

A: Talks about undergraduates who don't have the recommended qualifications not being exempt from going to Peking. This does not necessarily bar them from entering without a test.
B: Talks about Nanyang University, a completely different university, so this is out of context and irrelevant to the original assertion.
C: This option seems to suggest that having the recommended qualifications is not enough to go to Beijing University without a test. However, the original assertion suggests that it is enough.

  The argument states that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other crimes.
  It then states that most crimes involving firearms do not result in homicides.
  Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the use of firearms as a serious offense in criminal law.
  However, the fact that most firearms crimes do not result in homicides does not negate the fact that they are more likely to lead to them than other crimes.

  J and O must be on the same day. This means J must be on the fourth day, since O is on the third day.
  J should be placed on the next day of duty H. This means H is not on the fourth day.

  From the above mentioned five constraints, it can be deduced that K must have been on the first or second day, and on the first day since the fourth day is out, and G has to be on the same day as one of J and O, K cannot be on the second day which clears the path for J to be on the second day.
  The remaining days for the other people left are L and M, and G must be on the same day as either J and O. Only O has had a fixed day and J will be on the fourth day. L and M cannot take up to two days, since another person must take up the other two days.

  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H. 
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day.
  - G and J or O are on the same day.
  - O must be on the third day.
  - K must be arranged on at least one day on the first or second day.
  
  If we consider the condition that K must be arranged on at least one day on the first or second day, both J and O can be arranged as the second day. We know from the condition that O must be on the third day, which means J can only be arranged on the second day. And since it is required that different staff can't have the same duty during these four days camping, G can only be arranged on the first day with possibility of either K or L.
  Therefore, the next one to come is K or L.

If the Finance Department is located on the third level, we know that:
- The Planning Department must be either on the second or fourth floor.
- The Administrative Department must be on a floor higher than the Planning Department but below the Human Resources Department and the Sales Department.
- The Human Resources Department and the Sales Department are not adjacent which means they can only be located on the top and bottom floor or the 1st and 4th floor.
Now, let's evaluate the answer choices.
A: The R&D department is on the fifth floor - We don't have enough information to confirm or deny this option.
B: The R&D department is on the upper level of the sales department - This cannot be true as the Sales Department and the Human Resources Department are not adjacent.
C: The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department - This must be true if the Administration Department is above the Planning Department.
D: The Sales Department is on a certain layer above the Planning Department - This cannot be true since the Sales Department cannot be adjacent to the Human Resources Department which is above the Sales Department.
Therefore, the answer is C: The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department.

  The finance department is on the third level.
  According to (2), the finance department is next to the planning department, which means the planning department is either on the second floor or the fourth floor.
  According to (3), the administrative department is above the planning department, so the administrative department is on the fourth floor or the fifth floor.
  According to (1), the sales department cannot be on the second or fourth floor, so it must be on the first, fifth or sixth floor.
  So, the human resource department is either on the first or the sixth floor since both departments are not adjacent.
  If the research and development department is on the upper level of the sales department, then the R & D department is on the sixth floor, and the sales department is on the fifth floor. This conflicts with the fact that the human resources department is also on a different floor from the sales department.
  Therefore, the research and development department is on the fifth floor.
  Then, the administrative department is on the fourth floor.
  Therefore, the sales department is on the first floor.

  The finance department is on the third floor.
  From (2), the finance department is next to the planning department, which means the planning department is either on the second or fourth floor.
  From (3), the administration department is above the planning department, which means the administration department is on a floor above the second or fourth floor.
  From (1), the human resources department and the sales department floors cannot be next to each other. Hence, either the human resources department or the sales department can be on fifth floor.
  Option A may be correct based on the given information.
  Option B is incorrect because the R&D department can't be on the upper level of the sales department since floors of human resources department and sales department are not adjacent.
  Option C is incorrect because it is already given in the question that the administration department is above the planning department.
  Option D is incorrect because the relative floors of the sales department and human resources department are not specified.

  Based on the information given, we know the following: 
  - The finance department is on the third level.
  - The planning department is on a floor adjacent to the finance department's floor.
  - The administrative department is above the planning department in terms of floor levels, but below the human resources department.
  - The human resources and sales departments are not adjacent to each other.
  Using this information, we can determine that the only correct statement is (C) The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department.
  This is because the planning department and finance department are adjacent and finance is on the third level, which means the planning department must be on the second level. Thus, the administration department is above the planning department, but below the human resources department; it cannot be on the upper level of the planning department.

  The finance department is on the third level.
  According to the information given (2), the planning department is on either the second or the fourth level.
  If the planning department is on the second level, the finance department is on the floor below.
  If the planning department is on the fourth level, the finance department is on the floor above.
  According to the information given (3), the administrative department is above the planning department but below the human resources department.
  Therefore:
  If the planning department is on the second level, the administrative department should be on the sixth level, but the human resources department can only be on the fifth level, which is adjacent to the sales department, and this conflicts with the information given (1). Therefore, this is not possible.
  If the planning department is on the fourth level, the administrative department should be on the fifth or sixth level. In conclusion, the possible combinations of departments at each level are as follows:
  6th: Human resources department
  5th: Administrative department and sales department
  4th: Planning department
  3rd: Finance department
  2nd: Research and development department
  According to the above assignment of levels, we can obtain the following conclusions:
  A is incorrect because R & D department is on the second level.
  B is incorrect because R & D department is on the second level and the adjacent floor is the planning department.
  C is correct because the administrative department is not adjacent to the planning department, and the possible combination is that the administrative department is located on the fifth level.
  D is incorrect because the sales department is on the fifth floor.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department.

Using this information, we can evaluate the answer choices as follows:
A: The R & D department is on the fifth floor - we cannot determine this based on the given information.
B: The R & D department is on the upper level of the sales department - The two floors of the human resources department, and the sales department are not adjacent. Therefore, this choice cannot be true.

  We know that the finance department is on the third level.
  There are six floors in total, so floors 1, 2 and 6 are possible for the departments that are not already placed.
  Let's analyze each choice based on the given information.

  A: The R&D department is on the fifth floor.
     If the finance department is on the third floor, then the R&D department cannot be on the fifth floor because it would be adjacent to the sales department which is not allowed. This choice violates the given information.
  B: The R&D department is on the upper level of the sales department.
     If the finance department is on the third floor, then the sales department cannot be on the fourth floor. So, the only floor left for the sales department is the sixth floor. Therefore, the R&D department is on the fifth floor, which is not adjacent to the sales department. This choice satisfies the given information. 
  C: The Administration Department is not on the upper level of the Planning Department.
     If the finance department is on the third floor and the administration department is below the human resources department, then the administration department cannot be on the fifth floor (the same level of human resources department) but on the fourth floor. Thus, the administration department is on a lower level than the planning department, so this choice is correct.

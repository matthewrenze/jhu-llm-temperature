  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday as well. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday as well. This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.

  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of those photographs can be in the Sports section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then Hue must also have a photograph in the Metro section.

  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. So, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. So, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Now, we can check each choice to see if it is possible:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option C and D because they do not have at least two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option E because Knutson cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Option A violates the constraint that Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

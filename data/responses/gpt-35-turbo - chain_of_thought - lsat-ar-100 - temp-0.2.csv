    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the buildings must be of the same class or follow the rules of the three kinds of trades.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building and the Ortiz Building (both class 2).
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) and Trustcorp can trade the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House and the Zimmer House (both class 3).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Meyer Building (class 2).
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  In order to make a trade, the companies must have buildings of the same class.
  Therefore, RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower, and Southco can only trade the Flores Tower with the Garza Tower.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower with the Flores Tower, then Southco will own two class 1 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  After the trade, RealProp will own the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Yates House (class 3) or the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco will own the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp will own the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

  Option A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Option B: Kim cannot work in Zone 3 because there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and we don't have any other information to determine if Parra works in Zone 3.
  Option C: Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and we don't have any other information to determine if Tiao works in Zone 3.
  Option D: Stuckey and Udall can work in Zone 3 because we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. However, we don't have any other information to determine if any other sales representative works in Zone 3.
  Option E: Parra and Quinn can work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall can also work in Zone 3 because we know that they work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.

This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (sugar), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (oatmeal and peanut butter), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (sugar and oatmeal), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (peanut butter). Therefore, the statement that could be false is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (sugar), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (oatmeal and peanut butter), exactly one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday (oatmeal), and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Friday (peanut butter and sugar).

  We need to determine which option will allow us to select exactly three workers for the project and one of them as the project leader while satisfying all the given constraints.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. So, we cannot select exactly three workers for the project and one of them as the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. So, we cannot select exactly three workers for the project and one of them as the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we can select three workers from the remaining five workers. But, we cannot determine the project leader from the given information.

  Now we can check each choice to see if it is possible:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.

  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd. The vase must be auctioned on June 6th, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which of the options is possible based on the given conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But the table must be auctioned before the harmonica. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned before the harmonica. This is possible. Therefore, option B could be true.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But the table must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, option C is not possible.

  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  There are six antiques to be auctioned, so each antique will be auctioned once and only once.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. However, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, so this is not possible.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This is possible because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd or later, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This is possible because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd or later and the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd or later, then the mirror can be auctioned on any day from June 1st to June 4th, which means the vase can be auctioned on any day from June 3rd to June 6th.

  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We can eliminate choice A because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We can eliminate choice C because Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  We can eliminate choice D because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. But Kyle and Lenore cannot give reports, so this is not possible.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.

  We need to determine which students could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each dayâ€”one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday, but he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since George cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday, he must give an afternoon report on one of those days.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which means that neither of them can give a morning report on Wednesday. Therefore, George must give a morning report on Wednesday, and Helen and Irving must give the afternoon report on Wednesday. This leaves Olivia and Robert to give the morning reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, George can give a morning report on Monday, and Olivia and Robert can give the morning reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then George must give a morning report on Monday, and Olivia and Robert must give the morning reports on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively.

  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in different rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in different rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used. This means that white cannot be used alone in a rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach must also be used in that rug.
  From the given rules, we can conclude that:
    - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a multicolored rug.
    - Peach must be used in at least one of the rugs.
    - Yellow can be used in a rug.
    - White cannot be used alone in a rug.
    - Olive and peach can be used together in a multicolored rug.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.

  There are four lectures and each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  Let's try to create a schedule that satisfies all the constraints and see which option cannot be true.
  We can start with Farley giving the first lecture on watercolors, Holden giving the second lecture on oil paintings, Garcia giving the third lecture on sculptures, and Jiang giving the last lecture on lithographs.
  This schedule satisfies all the constraints.
  Now, let's check each option:

  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This can be true based on the schedule we created.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. This cannot be true because Farley gives the first lecture on watercolors.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. This cannot be true because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.

  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed first, since P must be performed before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed second or third if O is performed first.
  If O is performed fifth, then P can be performed first, second, or third.

  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first or second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed sixth or seventh.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if R is performed first, then F must be performed seventh and the two compositions between F and R must be performed second and third.
  If F is performed first, then R must be performed eighth and the two compositions between F and R must be performed sixth and seventh.

  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday. This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Friday. This contradicts the fact that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.

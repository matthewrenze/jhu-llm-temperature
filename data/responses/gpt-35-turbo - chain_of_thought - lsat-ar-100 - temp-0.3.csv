  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviewed Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Lopez must have reviewed Tamerlane, but this contradicts the statement that Kramer and O'Neill are the only two who reviewed Tamerlane.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must have reviewed Sunset as well, which contradicts the statement that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.

  Option B is not possible because RealProp has only one class 1 building, and Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings.
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Lynch Building (class 2), Southco can trade Flores Tower (class 1) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3), and Trustcorp can trade King Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp has only one class 1 building, and Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp has only one class 1 building, and Southco has only one class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  RealProp cannot trade the Yates House and the Zimmer House for anything because they are both class 3 buildings.
  Southco cannot trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings because it is a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp cannot trade any of its buildings for a class 1 building because it does not own any class 1 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower, Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Yates House, and Trustcorp owns the Lynch Building, the Zimmer House, the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  There are three types of trades that can be made.
  After one trade, each company will still own three buildings.
  Therefore, one company must trade one of their buildings for two buildings of the same class or two buildings of a lower class.
  The only way to do this is if RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings or if Trustcorp trades one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, then Southco must trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 3 buildings.
  This leaves Trustcorp with the King Building, the Meyer Building, the Ortiz Building, the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  The only answer choice that fits this scenario is E.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then the wall must have both paintings of Franz and Greene. This contradicts the condition that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall must have both paintings of Franz and Hidalgo. This contradicts the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  C: If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then it must be on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, and Greene's watercolor must be in a lower position on that wall. This satisfies the condition that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, C can be true.
  D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then it must be on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, and this satisfies the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, D can be true.
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall must have both paintings of Isaacs and Hidalgo. This contradicts the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  Let's try to determine the schedule of the cookie batches based on the given conditions:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We can start by placing the batches of sugar cookies on Thursday. Since there are only three batches of each kind of cookie, the third batch of sugar cookies must be on Tuesday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also on Tuesday, and therefore the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also on Tuesday. Now we have placed all the batches except for the first batch of cookies for each kind. We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is on Wednesday. This gives us the following schedule:
  Monday: oatmeal (1st batch)
  Tuesday: peanut butter (1st batch), oatmeal (2nd batch), sugar (3rd batch)
  Wednesday: sugar (1st batch), peanut butter (2nd batch), oatmeal (3rd batch)
  Thursday: sugar (2nd batch)
  Friday: peanut butter (3rd batch)
  Now we can answer the question:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, which is Tuesday. This means that on Tuesday, there are batches of oatmeal (1st batch), peanut butter (1st batch), and sugar (3rd batch). Therefore, the statement that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We know that if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it must be the oatmeal cookies and sugar cookies.
  If oatmeal cookies' first batch is made on the same day as sugar cookies' third batch, then oatmeal cookies' first batch must be made on Wednesday and sugar cookies' third batch must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  We can now check each choice to see which one could be false:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False, because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we have determined that oatmeal cookies' first batch is made on Wednesday)

  Let's consider the choices:
  A: If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Irving must also give a report on Wednesday. This would mean that all three reports on Wednesday are taken, which is not possible since George, Nina, and Robert are already assigned to different days. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. This is possible since George is already assigned to Tuesday. Therefore, B could be true.
  C: If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This is not possible since George is already assigned to Tuesday and Robert is already assigned to a different day. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then we would need to assign the last report to either Helen, Irving, or Lenore. However, we can't assign it to Helen since she must give a report on the day after Nina's report, and we can't assign it to Irving or Lenore since they can't give a report on Monday.

  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  We can now use the remaining information to determine which answer choice could be true.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This eliminates choices A, B, and C.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th. This eliminates choice D.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so they will be featured on either day 3 or day 4.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can be featured on any three days from day 2 to day 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on any two days from day 2 to day 6.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, the breed featured on day 3 or day 4 cannot be featured on day 2 or day 5.
- Based on the above conditions, we can create a chart to keep track of which breeds are featured on which days.

| Day | Kitten | Puppy |
| --- | ------ | ----- |
| 1   |        | G     |
| 2   | H      | N     |
| 3   | M      |       |

| 5   | M      | R     |
| 6   | H      | N     |
| 7   | S      |       |

- From the chart, we can see that:
  - Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  - Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and day 4.
  - Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section must be paired with a photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section must be paired with a photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities:
    1. The photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section is paired with a photograph by Hue in the Metro section.
    2. The photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section is paired with a photograph by a photographer other than Hue in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the only choice that could be true is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that none of the photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon.
  We also know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photographer who has a photograph in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections must be either Fuentes or Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then either one or two photographs in the Sports section are by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.

  Let's go through each choice and see if it satisfies the given conditions:
    - Choice A: Includes two botanists (F and G) and two zoologists (P and Q). This violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.

  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the books on the shelves.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F and K on the other two shelves, since K is placed on a higher shelf than F. We can then place L and O on the remaining shelf, since O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions, so the placement of the books is fully determined if I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  From the condition ""O is placed on a higher shelf than L"", we know that O cannot be on the same shelf as L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf.
  From the condition ""More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf"", we know that there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.

  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S is either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G and R cannot be first or second. This would mean that H is first, and J is second. However, this would violate the rule that J must be earlier than G.

  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order must be JGR.
  S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, the order must end with S _ Y.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, the order must be JGRQS_ or _SQRGJ.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, the order must be _SQRGJ.
  The order of the nutrition articles must be QS_R.

  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles (G, H, J), three nutrition articles (Q, R, S), and one wildlife article (Y).
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S is either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means R is fourth, G is fifth, H is sixth, and J is seventh. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means R is fourth, G is fifth, J is sixth, and H is seventh. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  Therefore, Y cannot be fifth.
  If R is seventh, then G must be sixth, H must be fifth, S must be fourth, Q must be third, J must be second, and Y must be first. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If R is fourth, then G must be third, which means J must be second and H must be first. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If H is fourth, then G must be third, which means J must be second, R must be first, and S must be fifth. This violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If H is sixth, then G must be fifth, which means R must be fourth, Q must be third, S must be second, J must be first, and Y must be seventh. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is sixth.

  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that G must be edited after J and before R.
  We know that Q must be edited third or later and S must be edited before Y.
  We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  We can use the process of elimination to determine the answer.
  If H is fourth, we do not know the order of the other articles yet, so the order is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, we still do not know the order of the other articles yet, so the order is not fully determined.

  If R is seventh, we do not know the order of the other articles yet, so the order is not fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, we know that S must be edited first, then Q must be edited third, and then we can edit R, G, J, H, and Y in that order. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  The answer is either C or E. We need to determine which one is correct.
  If R is fourth, we know that Q must be edited third or later. Therefore, we can edit Q third, S first, and then we can edit H, G, J, R, and Y in that order. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, we know that S must be edited first. Therefore, we can edit S first, then we can edit Q third, and then we can edit R, G, J, H, and Y in that order. Therefore, the order is fully determined.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist cannot be at either end of the row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist and must be next to the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be next to the optometrist either.
  Therefore, the optometrist and the shoe store must be in the middle of the row with three businesses on either side.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the toy store.

  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can use the given conditions to determine which batches were made on each day.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
    - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
    - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
    - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We can use these conditions to create a schedule of when each batch is made.
  We know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, so there are a total of nine batches.
  If one batch is made on Friday, then eight batches are made from Monday to Thursday.
  We can start by placing the second batch of sugar cookies on Thursday, since that is the only day it can be made.
  We can also place the first batch of peanut butter cookies on Monday, since it cannot be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  We can then use the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies to determine when the oatmeal cookies are made.
  Finally, we can use the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day to fill in the rest of the schedule.
  Once we have the schedule, we can determine which batches could be made on Friday with only one batch.
  The batches that are already scheduled for Monday to Thursday are:
    - First batch of oatmeal cookies
    - Second batch of oatmeal cookies
    - First batch of peanut butter cookies
    - Second batch of peanut butter cookies
    - First batch of sugar cookies
    - Second batch of sugar cookies
  We need to schedule the third batch of each kind of cookie and one more batch of any kind.
  We can see that the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday, since the first two batches are already scheduled for Monday and Thursday.
  We can also see that the third batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday, since the first two batches are already scheduled for Monday and Wednesday.
  We can try to schedule the third batch of oatmeal cookies on Friday, but we run into a problem if we do.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  However, both of those days already have two batches scheduled, so this is not possible.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  This leaves us with two possibilities for the batch made on Friday:
    - Third batch of sugar cookies
    - Third batch of peanut butter cookies
  Therefore, the answer is either:
    - A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
    - D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

  If the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday. However, if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then there would be no batches of cookies left to make on Wednesday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions and means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. The answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then Trustcorp will own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp will still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for a class 1 building.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower).
  Southco owns a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and a class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded the Garza Tower with Trustcorp for a class 2 building, and Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building with Southco for the Garza Tower.
  Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.

  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp no longer owns any class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, which means that it must have traded its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings because no one owns two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building.
  This means that RealProp owns a class 1 building, a class 2 building, and a class 3 building.

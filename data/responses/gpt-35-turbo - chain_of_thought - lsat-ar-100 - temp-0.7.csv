  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, that means the other two students did not review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the student who reviewed the third play must not be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, the student who reviewed Undulation must not be either Lopez or Megregian.
  This means that the student who reviewed Undulation is either Jiang, Kramer, or O'Neill.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Megregian must review only Tamerlane and Sunset. This is impossible because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and no one else reviewed Sunset.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then O'Neill must review only Tamerlane and Sunset. This is possible because Kramer also reviewed Tamerlane.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset. This is impossible because Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Sunset. This is impossible because O'Neill also reviewed Sunset.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Megregian must review Tamerlane. This is possible because Kramer also reviewed Tamerlane.

  If exactly three students review Undulation, then two students must review the same play, but not Undulation.
  Thus, the two students who review the same play cannot be Lopez and Megregian since they each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, the two students who review the same play must be Kramer and O'Neill, who both review Tamerlane.
  Since Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, and exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other, then Jiang must review Undulation.

  Exactly three students review Undulation.
  The only possible combinations of students reviewing Undulation are {Jiang, Kramer, O'Neill}, {Jiang, Kramer, Lopez}, and {Jiang, Lopez, O'Neill}.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  So, {Jiang, Kramer, O'Neill} must be the combination of students who review Undulation.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang must not review Tamerlane or Undulation.
  The remaining play that Jiang can review is Sunset.
  The only possible combinations of students reviewing the same play or plays are {Kramer, O'Neill} and {Kramer, Lopez}.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Tamerlane or Sunset.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he reviews Sunset. But, Sunset is already reviewed by Jiang and no other student can review Sunset. Therefore, O'Neill must review Undulation.
  So, the possible combinations of student-play reviews are:
    - Jiang: Sunset
    - Kramer: Tamerlane, Undulation
    - Lopez: Undulation
    - Megregian: Sunset, Tamerlane, Undulation
    - O'Neill: Tamerlane, Undulation

  Therefore, the two students who reviewed the same play or plays must have reviewed Sunset because no one else reviewed it.
  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviews and Jiang did not review Sunset, then Lopez and Megregian reviewed Undulation.
  That means Megregian reviewed Undulation, and the condition Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian is satisfied because both reviewed only one play.

  From the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane, so the 2 students who reviewed the same play or plays as each other must be Kramer and O'Neill.
  Therefore, Megregian reviewed a different play, and since Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, Lopez reviewed only 1 play, and it is not Undulation.

  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then only two students can review Undulation, which is a contradiction.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then he must have reviewed Tamerlane. That means the other student who reviewed Tamerlane must not have reviewed Undulation, which is a contradiction.

At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. So, the organizer must select at least three French novels and two Russian novels. The maximum number of French works that can be selected is four, which means that both French plays cannot be selected. Therefore, the organizer must select three French novels and two Russian novels, which satisfies all the requirements. This gives us a total of five works.
  4. The organizer selects six works. In this case, the organizer must select at least three novels. At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. So, the organizer must select at least three French novels and three Russian novels. The maximum number of French works that can be selected is four, which means that both French plays cannot be selected. Therefore, the organizer must select three French novels, three Russian novels, and one French or Russian play, which satisfies all the requirements. This gives us a total of seven works.
  
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the organizer must at least select one French novel, one Russian novel, and one French or Russian play, which is only satisfied by option A.

  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Thus, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2 and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the rules above and the possible parking space assignments for Robertson, the only possible assignment is:
    #1: Robertson
    #2: Young
    #3: Xu
    #4: Togowa
    #5: Souza

  We know that:
  - Four art students (Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, Isaacs) will display exactly two paintings (an oil and a watercolor).
  - Two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls 1, 2, 3, and 4 with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  A. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1. But we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so this situation is impossible. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  
  B. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3. But this means that wall 3 would only have paintings from Franz and Hidalgo, which violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  
  C. This is possible because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, C can be true.
  
  D. This is possible because we only know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, D can be true.
  
  E. If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3. But this means that wall 3 would only have paintings from Hidalgo and Isaacs, which violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. This implies that Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. This implies that each wall must have at least one oil painting displayed on it.
  We also know that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. This implies that each wall must have paintings from at least two different students.
  If we try to place the paintings on each wall using the given conditions, we will find that all the choices except one can be true. 
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed in a lower position because that would mean that wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This implies that Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which eliminates choice B. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

  To find the answer, we need to use logic and process of elimination.
  We know that each wall has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  We also know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, each wall must have at least one oil painting.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  1. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  2. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  3. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  4. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Let's try each answer choice:
  A. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, that means Franz's oil and Hidalgo's paintings cannot be on the same wall. This is possible according to the given conditions. Therefore A can be true.
  B. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, that means Franz's oil and Greene's paintings cannot be on the same wall. This is possible according to the given conditions. Therefore B can be true.
  C. If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, that means Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil cannot be on the same wall. This is possible according to the given conditions. Therefore C can be true.
  D. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, that means Hidalgo's oil and Isaacs's oil cannot be on the same wall. This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore D cannot be true.
  E. If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, that means Isaacs's oil and Greene's watercolor cannot be on the same wall. This violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore E cannot be true.

  Since each wall contains two paintings, we can create a table to show the possible combinations of the upper and lower positions on each wall.
  We can use a process of elimination to determine which option cannot be true based on the given conditions.
  Let's start with the given conditions:
  1. No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  2. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  3. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  4. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  5. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If we apply the given conditions to each option, we can determine which option cannot be true.
  A. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor must also be on that wall, which means the wall has only the works of Franz and Greene on it. This violates condition 2, so option A cannot be true.
  B. If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor must also be on that wall, which means the wall has only the works of Franz and Hidalgo on it. This violates condition 2, so option B cannot be true.
  C. If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position. This does not violate any of the conditions, so option C can be true.
  D. If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This does not violate any of the conditions, so option D can be true.
  E. If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Isaacs's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor must also be on that wall, which means the wall has only the works of Isaacs and Hidalgo on it. This violates condition 2, so option E cannot be true.

  We are given that:
  - Each of the four students will display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor.
  - Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  We need to determine which one of the following CANNOT be true.
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil
    If this were true, then both Franz and Greene would have their oil and watercolor paintings on the same wall, which would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, A is false.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    If this were true, then either Franz or Greene would have both their paintings displayed on the same wall, which would again violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, B is false.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
    According to the given conditions, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Thus, Greene's oil must be displayed in a lower position. Therefore, C is false.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
    According to the given conditions, each wall has one painting in the upper position and one painting in the lower position. Therefore, D is false because it would mean that there is no oil painting displayed in a lower position on the wall where Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    If this were true, then either Hidalgo or Isaacs would have both their paintings displayed on the same wall, which violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, E is false.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. Answer(""D"")

  From the conditions given, we know George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Therefore, there are only a few possible combinations for the students who give reports on Wednesday.
  Kyle and Nina cannot give reports together on any day because of Kyle's afternoon report constraint.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  From the above, it follows that George cannot give a report on Monday either because if he did, he would have to give a report on Tuesday and then there would be no way to schedule the oral reports for the remaining six students.
  Therefore, George must give a report on Wednesday. If he does so, then Helen and Irving must also give a report on Wednesday because if not, Nina would have to give a report on Wednesday, which is not allowed under the given conditions.
  So, if George gives a report on Wednesday, then the pair of students who must give a report on the same day as him are Helen and Irving.

  To determine the acceptable assignment of photographers, we need to consider the constraints given in the context.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  We have six photographers available. At least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  Based on these constraints, there is only one acceptable assignment of photographers:
  Silva University: Frost, Heideck
  Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai

  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, there are only three possible combinations of sales representatives for each sales zone.
  We need to check which one of the remaining sales representatives cannot work with Quinn in the same sales zone.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1 with Kim, then Stuckey and Mahr must work in Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1 with Mahr, then Stuckey and Kim must work in Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3 with Stuckey, then Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Udall and Parra must work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3 with Tiao, then Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must work in Zone 1 and Udall and Parra must work in Zone 2.

  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2, which violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.

  - Oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar are the three types of cookies.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then there are two possible scenarios:
    - Scenario 1: Oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch.
      - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
      - Therefore, peanut butter's first batch is made on Monday (because oatmeal's first batch cannot be made on Monday).
      - Sugar's third batch is made on Friday (because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday).
      - Oatmeal's first batch and sugar's third batch are made on the same day, which means there are only 4 possible days for the first batch of peanut butter cookies: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
      - This scenario means that there are at least two batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
    - Scenario 2: Sugar's first batch is made on the same day as oatmeal's third batch.
      - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
      - Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday (because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies).
      - Sugar's first batch and oatmeal's third batch are made on the same day, which means there are only 4 possible days for the first batch of peanut butter cookies: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
      - This scenario means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - Therefore, the statement that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - If Scenario 1 is true, there are only 4 possible days for the first batch of peanut butter cookies: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, there will be two batches of oatmeal cookies made on the same day (first and third batches), which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday.
  - If Scenario 2 is true, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This means that there are four batches of cookies left to be made on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Tuesday or Wednesday to ensure that all three kinds of cookies are made each week. Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.

  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must be a project member because if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, the three selected workers will be Taylor, Wells, and Xue or Verma. We still do not know who will be the project leader. So, this condition does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must be a project member and Wells cannot be because if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.

We now know the identity of all three project members and the project leader, so this condition completely determines the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader because if Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they can be a project member only if leading the project.

  Use the given conditions to determine possible auction orders.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Thus, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The harmonica must be auctioned after the sundial. Thus, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. 
  Therefore, if the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror can be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and vase. Thus, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 
  The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or vase, but not both. Thus, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  Given the above, the following auction orders are possible:
  June 1st: table, vase, harmonica, lamp, mirror, sundial
  June 2nd: table, sundial, mirror, harmonica, lamp, vase
  June 3rd: table, sundial, mirror, vase, harmonica, lamp

  June 5th: sundial, table, harmonica, lamp, vase, mirror
  June 6th: sundial, table, harmonica, vase, lamp, mirror

  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can trade any of them for two class 3 buildings.
  From this analysis, we can deduce that:

- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

We can deduce the following:
- Greyhounds are featured on Day 1, and thus Himalayans can only be featured on Day 2, 4, and 6.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, and not on Day 1, so the other two breeds must be featured on Days 1 and 7, or Days 7 and 2, or Days 2 and 4, or Days 4 and 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, which means Rottweilers can only be featured on Days 1, 3, 5, or 7 but not when Himalayans are featured.

Using the above deductions, we can check the answer choices:

A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
- We have three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies. 
- Each breed must be featured on at least one day.
- Since we have only seven days, there must be at least one breed that is featured on two days.

C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
- Himalayans are only featured on Days 2, 4, and 6.
- Greyhounds are only featured on Day 1.
- Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
- Rottweilers cannot be featured on Days 2, 4, and 6 when Himalayans are featured.
- Himalayans are not featured on Day 1, 5, and 7.
- Therefore, this statement can be true.

E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
- Himalayans are not featured on Day 1, 5, and 7.

  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Hence, it is possible that Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 1 day.
  Therefore, the correct answer is the option that is not necessarily true.
  Option A: Image's website target is 1 day is true based on the above analysis.
  Option B: Solide's website target is 2 days is true based on the above analysis.
  Option C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days is true based on the above analysis.
  Option D: Truvest's website target is 2 days may or may not be true based on the above analysis. If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then the condition ""Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target"" is not violated.
  Option E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days may or may not be true based on the above analysis. If Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day, then none of the clients has a voicemail target of 2 days.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We are asked to find the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  Let's see how we can apply the given conditions to answer the question.
  
Solution:
  We are given that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  Therefore, only six students (George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert) will give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Let's see which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively:
  
  Monday:
  Since neither Kyle nor Lenore can give a report, the morning reports on Monday can be given by (in any order):
  - George and Nina
  - George and Olivia
  - Nina and Olivia
  
  Tuesday:
  We are given that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Also, we know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Tuesday can be given by (in any order):
  - Helen and Irving
  - Helen and Nina
  - Helen and George
  
  Wednesday:
  We are given that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We are also given that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Wednesday can be given by (in any order):
  - Robert and George
  - Robert and Nina
  - George and Nina
  
  Let's check which of the given choices satisfies the above conditions.
  
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
     - Helen can give a report on Tuesday morning, but she must also give a report on Wednesday morning if Nina gives a report (which is possible). Therefore, this choice does not work.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
     - Helen can give a report on Tuesday morning, and neither Robert nor Helen can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice works.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
     - Helen can give a report on Tuesday morning, but neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice does not work.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
     - Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice works.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
     - Helen can give a report on Tuesday morning, and neither Robert nor Helen can give an afternoon report. Therefore, this choice works.
  
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, are:
  - Monday: George and Nina or George and Olivia or Nina and Olivia
  - Tuesday: Helen and Irving or Helen and Nina or Helen and George

  We can check each choice to see if it is possible by making a table and assigning students to each day and time slot.
  Choice A is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Choice B is not possible because we need Nina to give a report to trigger Helen and Irving to give reports the next day.
  Choice C is possible by assigning Nina, Helen, and Olivia to Monday morning, George, Robert, and Irving to Tuesday morning, and leaving Wednesday morning for the remaining student, which is either George or Kyle.
  Choice D is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  Choice E is not possible because we need Nina to give a report to trigger Helen and Irving to give reports the next day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia.

  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they are not part of the six students who will give reports. So, we can eliminate them from the choices.
  Let's try to assign the reports according to these conditions.
  If we assign Nina's report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that George's report must be on Wednesday. Then, we can assign Olivia and Robert to Monday and Tuesday in any order, and we get the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as Robert, George, and Helen.
  If we assign Nina's report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday, which means that George can give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday. Then, we can assign Olivia and Robert to Monday and Tuesday in any order, and we get the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday as Robert, Helen, and George or Olivia, Helen, and George.
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, George, and Helen or Olivia, Helen, and George. Both choices are valid.

  We need to find three people from the remaining five students (George, Helen, Irving, Nina, and Olivia) who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, they cannot be a part of the answer.
  From the remaining students, we can eliminate George, as he can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Since Helen and Irving cannot give reports on the same day, we need to make sure they don't appear together in any of the answer choices.
  From the remaining students, we can eliminate Nina, as she may or may not give a report, and we cannot determine which day she will give a report.
  Therefore, the answer should be a combination of Olivia, Helen, and Irving or Olivia, Robert, and Irving.

Option A:
  The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  There are two possible days when the table can be auctioned, June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st, which is earlier than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, which is earlier than the table.
  Option A could be true.
  
Option B:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The lamp can be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then option B could be true.
  However, we cannot be sure that the table is auctioned on June 6th.
  Option B is not necessarily true.
  
Option C:

  The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial can be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then option C could be true.
  However, we cannot be sure that the table is auctioned on June 6th.
  Option C is not necessarily true.
  
Option D:
  The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  If the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase, then the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, June 5th or June 6th, then option D could be true.
  Option D could be true.
  
Option E:

  Rule 5: Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  To minimize the number of multicolored rugs, we should use solid colors in two rugs and multicolor in one rug.
  Let's try to create the rugs using the above rules:
  Rug 1: Solid color rug: Can be any color except olive or peach.
  Rug 2: Solid color rug: Can be any color except forest or turquoise.
  Rug 3: Multicolor rug: Can have any combination of two colors except forest and turquoise. Let's try to use olive and peach together in this rug.
      So, we can use olive, peach, and any other three colors except forest, turquoise, and yellow.
  Thus, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs. Hence, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.

  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3. 
  Because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.

If Yoshio is not assigned to the project:
- There are only 5 students left for the project: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
- We know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. 
- If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
- Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so it does not affect the assignments of the other students.
- Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany will be assigned to the project.
- The sum of the year assignments is 1921 + 1922 + 1923 + 1924 = 768. Each of the four students will be assigned a year, so the sum of the year assignments will be equal to 4 times the year assigned to each student.

- If Louis is not assigned to the project, the lowest possible sum of year assignments is 772, which is greater than 768.
- If Ryan is not assigned to the project, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which means Louis must be assigned to 1923, and the sum of year assignments would be 768 + 772 + 780 + 776 = 3096, which is not a multiple of 4.

  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L is either third or fourth and M is either fifth or seventh.
  If J is seventh, then the first and second houses must be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the third house shown, because K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be the fourth or fifth house shown. But if K is the fourth or fifth house shown and L is shown after K and before M, then L must be the third house shown. But this is impossible, because the first and second houses must be shown in the morning. Therefore, J cannot be seventh. Thus, J is sixth.
  If J is sixth, then the first and second houses must be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the third house shown, because K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K must be the fourth or fifth house shown. If K is fourth, then L is third and M is fifth. But this is impossible, because the first and second houses must be shown in the morning.

  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday and the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means there would be no batches of oatmeal cookies left to make on Friday.
  
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Friday because it is the only oatmeal cookie batch left to make and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. This means there would be no batches of peanut butter cookies left to make on Friday.
  
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

  We are given that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  We are also given that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there is at least one batch of cookies that is not made on Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so if one of them is made on Friday, the other must also be made on Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so none of the sugar cookies are made on Friday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there can be at most one batch of oatmeal or peanut butter cookies made on Friday.
  This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

  The shoe store is in space 4, which means the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or space 7.
  Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, the pharmacy can only be in space 2 or space 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the only possible arrangement for the restaurants is R _ _ R, where _ represents a space.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so it can only be in space 6 if the optometrist is in space 5 or space 7 if the veterinarian is in space 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 7.
  Thus, the arrangement of the stores from space 1 to space 7 is P O _ R S T V.
  A: The optometrist cannot be next to a restaurant because it is in space 3.
  B: The pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian because the veterinarian is in space 7.

  We can use the restrictions to eliminate the possible orders of solos until we are left with only one possible order.
  Let's start with the saxophonist, who performs the solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. 
  If the saxophonist performs the solo after the percussionist, then we know that the percussionist must perform before the keyboard player, which means the violinist would perform before the percussionist, which would be impossible since the saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does.
  Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the solo after the trumpeter does.
  That means the percussionist must perform before the saxophonist, which means the percussionist must perform before the keyboard player.
  That also means the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the order must be: percussionist, trumpeter, saxophonist, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist.

  Therefore, the saxophonist doesn't perform the first or second solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player.
  Therefore, the percussionist performs the first or second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo because the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does but not the first or second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist can perform the third solo because the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does but not the first or second solo.
  Therefore, the saxophonist may or may not perform the third solo depending on whether the percussionist performs the first or second solo.

  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  To find the answer we need to analyze each option individually to see if they can perform the third solo.
  Let's start with the guitarist:
  - Guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  Let's move to the keyboard player:
  - Keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  - Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo, since the guitarist is not performing the fourth solo.
  Let's move to the saxophonist:
  - The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  - This restriction does not help us determine if the saxophonist can perform the third solo.
  Let's move to the trumpeter:
  - There is no restriction about when the trumpeter performs the solo.
  - The trumpeter can perform the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  Let's move to the violinist:
  - The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does.
  - Therefore, the violinist can perform the first, second, or third solo.

  Based on these restrictions, the saxophonist can perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, then the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist. This would mean that the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
  If the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter, then the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist. This would mean that the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.

  We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  From the given conditions, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.

  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, there are only two valid slots for Wellspring, which are slots one and two.
  
  If Wellspring performs in slot 1:
    Zircon must perform in slot 2.
    None of the first three slots can be Uneasy or Yardsign.
    Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot 3, Xpert must perform in slot 4, and one of the last three slots (slots 4, 5, 6) must be Uneasy.
    This means that Zircon performs in slot 6, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  
  If Wellspring performs in slot 2:
    Zircon must perform in slot 3, 4, 5, or 6.
    Since Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots and Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, Vegemite must perform in slot 1.
    Xpert must perform in slot 6 since Wellspring, Zircon, and one of Uneasy or Yardsign must perform in slots 1-5.
    Therefore, Uneasy and Yardsign must perform in slots 4 and 5, but their order is unknown.

  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it could be in slot five in the first order or slot six in the second order.

  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, and Vegemite and Wellspring are already assigned to slots two and three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one.

  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  If Greyhounds are featured on Day 1, then the breed featured on Day 2 must be either Himalayan or Rottweiler. Siamese is not an option since no breed can be featured on two consecutive days.
  If Himalayans are not featured on Day 1, then they must be featured on Day 5, 6, or 7. This means that Rottweilers cannot be featured on Day 5, 6, or 7.
  If Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7, then they must be featured on Day 2, 3, or 4. This means that Himalayans cannot be featured on Day 4.
  Day 3 and Day 4 are the only days where there is no restriction on the breeds that can be featured.
  Using the above logic, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C.
  Choice D and E both have breeds that can be featured on Day 5 and 6 respectively without violating any conditions.
  However, Choice D has Rottweilers which cannot be featured on Day 4. So, the only option that could be true is E.

- Greyhounds must be featured on day 1. Therefore, any day with Greyhounds cannot be consecutive with any other day.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, the last day must have a breed that is not featured on day 1.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans can only be featured on day 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on day 1, 2, 3, or 6.

  - Newfoundlands are the only breed that can be featured on day 3, since it cannot be Greyhounds or any breed featured on day 2.
  - Himalayans must be featured on exactly three days, so it cannot be featured on day 2 or day 7. Therefore, it must be featured on any three days among day 3, 4, 5, and 6. Let's try Himalayans on day 3, 4, and 5 for now.
  - Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day with Himalayans, so it cannot be on day 3, 4, or 5. Therefore, it must be on day 1 or day 6.
  - Manx cannot be featured on day 5, since it cannot be consecutive with any other day. Therefore, it must be on day 6.
  - We have one empty spot left on day 7, which must be filled with any breed that has not been featured yet. The only option left is Newfoundland.

- With the table filled in, we can check each option:
  - Option A: Siamese cannot be featured on any day with Greyhounds. Therefore, this option cannot be true.

- From the given information, we know that Greyhounds must be featured on day 1, so we fill in G for day 1 in the first row of the chart.
- Also, we know that no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. Therefore, we can fill in the second row such that it does not contain G.
- We know that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, we can fill in the Himalayans row with H on three days except for day 1.
- We know that Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, we can fill in the Rottweilers row such that it does not contain R on day 7 and on the same days as Himalayans.

Now, let's check each choice:
A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
- According to our chart, we cannot feature Greyhounds on day 2 because no breed can be featured on two consecutive days. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
- According to our chart, we cannot feature any breed on day 7 that was featured on day 1 because any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
- According to our chart, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Therefore, they must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4. And, according to the given information, Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4. This choice is not possible.

D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
- According to our chart, we cannot feature any breed on day 5 that was featured on day 4 or day 6. Therefore, this choice is possible.

E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.

  If three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students might have reviewed the same play or a different play.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and only one student has not reviewed a play yet, so this student must have also reviewed Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviewed Undulation, neither Lopez nor Megregian could have reviewed Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, O'Neill must be one of them.
  If O'Neill reviewed Undulation, then he did not review Sunset, which means (E) is false.
  If O'Neill reviewed Undulation, and Kramer reviewed Tamerlane, then Megregian must have reviewed Sunset and Lopez must have reviewed either Undulation or Tamerlane. Therefore, (A), (B), and (D) are false, and (C) must be true.

  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students either review Tamerlane or Sunset or both.
  From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  From the given conditions, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews Undulation if it is reviewed by Jiang.
  So, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation must be either Lopez or Megregian.
  From the given conditions, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review two plays if exactly three students review Undulation.
  So, Megregian must review Undulation and one other play.
  Therefore, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane.
  So, O'Neill does not review Sunset.
  From the given conditions, exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the other two students who do not review Undulation must review the same play or plays.

  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane, and possibly Sunset.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them review Sunset.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must have reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane.
  We cannot say anything about Megregian, but we know that Lopez reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, so Lopez must have reviewed Sunset if Jiang reviewed Tamerlane, and vice versa.

  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students who don't review Undulation must have reviewed Tamerlane and Sunset.
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so neither of them can be part of the three students who reviewed Undulation.
  Therefore, the three students who reviewed Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  From the given conditions, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play Jiang reviews. Jiang did not review Undulation, so he must have reviewed Sunset or Tamerlane.
  Two students must have reviewed exactly the same play or plays as each other, and since Jiang reviewed either Sunset or Tamerlane, it means that Megregian, Lopez, or both reviewed the same play as Jiang.
  If Megregian reviewed the same play as Jiang, then Megregian reviewed Sunset or Tamerlane, but this is not possible since Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Lopez reviewed the same play as Jiang. So, Lopez reviewed Sunset or Tamerlane.
  From the given conditions, Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer of the plays than Megregian. Since Megregian reviewed Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez both reviewed Sunset or Tamerlane, and neither of them reviewed Undulation.

  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  If Megregian did not review Undulation, the two remaining students who reviewed the same play(s) cannot be Megregian and Lopez, because that would mean that Jiang reviewed Undulation, which is not allowed.
  If O'Neill did not review Undulation, the two remaining students who reviewed the same play(s) cannot be Kramer and O'Neill, because that would mean that Megregian and Lopez reviewed more plays than Kramer and O'Neill, which is not allowed.

- Therefore, the pair who review the same play must be among Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang cannot be in the pair who review the same play.
- If Megregian does not review Undulation, then we have two students who review Undulation (the pair who review the same play) and Megregian who reviews a different play. This is not possible since only three students can review Undulation.
- If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then we have two students who review Undulation (Jiang and the student who is paired with Jiang) and two students who review Tamerlane (Kramer and O'Neill). This leaves only Megregian to review Sunset. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

  Let's first identify the students who review Tamerlane and Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Let's assume that the third student that reviews the same play or plays as them is Megregian.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Megregian must be one of them.
  Since Megregian reviews Undulation and he reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, neither Kramer nor Lopez review Undulation.
  We know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  This means that only choices B, D and E are possible.
  Let's eliminate the choices that are impossible.
  We already know that O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so choice E is impossible.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian does not review any plays because Kramer cannot review Tamerlane or Undulation.

  We are given an information about five students and the plays they have reviewed.
  Let's assume that three students reviewed Undulation: A, B, and C.
  From the information given, we know that Kramer and O'neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the remaining two students who reviewed the same play as each other reviewed Sunset.
  Because Kramer and Lopez reviewed fewer plays than Megregian, we can eliminate the possibility of Kramer or Lopez being in the group of three students who reviewed Undulation.
  We are also given that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang must have reviewed Tamerlane or Sunset, not Undulation.
  If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then only one student remains who reviewed Undulation (either Kramer or O'Neill).
  If O'Neill reviewed Undulation, then there is no student who reviewed Sunset.
  Therefore, Megregian must have reviewed Undulation.
  Additionally, we are given that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill reviewed the same plays as each other (i.e. Tamerlane and Sunset).

  If exactly three students review Undulation, then exactly two students must review the same play as each other and this play cannot be Undulation since only three students are reviewing it.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, therefore, the two students who reviewed the same play must be among the remaining three: Jiang, Kramer, and Lopez.
  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and Kramer has already been paired with O'Neill, let's assume that Kramer and Jiang both review Undulation. That means the third student with the same play must be Lopez and she must review Tamerlane.
  This implies that Megregian does not review Tamerlane. If Megregian reviews Undulation, then O'Neill must review Sunset because no one else is left to review Sunset and at least two students must review the same play. Thus, O'Neill does not review Undulation.

  According to the question, there are three trade options that are allowed.
  After each trade, the company will end up with a building or two buildings whose class may or may not be the same as the building(s) they own now.
  In order for the trades to happen, the companies must make an exchange of buildings. Therefore, the same building cannot belong to two companies at the same time.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Based on the rules mentioned in the question, we can narrow down the possible building exchange scenarios.
  If we try to exchange the Yates House or the Zimmer House, only Trustcorp has a class 3 building to trade. But any exchange involving one of these houses would leave RealProp with two class 1 buildings, which is not possible according to the rules.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower (class 1). The only building that RealProp can receive in one trade is a class 2 building or two class 3 buildings.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower for a class 2 building, then Southco would need to trade one of their class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, but Trustcorp only has one class 3 building available.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 3 buildings, which means that Trustcorp must trade two class 2 buildings to Southco. This is possible because Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  The possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House (both class 3).
  Southco: the Flores Tower (class 1) and two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower (class 1) and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

  RealProp has a Class 1 building, a Class 3 building, and another Class 3 building.
  Southco has a Class 1 building and a Class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three Class 2 buildings.
  The three companies have to make one trade each, and they can only trade buildings of the same class or follow the given trading rules.
  In the first rule, it's impossible for class 1 buildings to be traded with class 3 buildings.
  In the second rule, it's impossible to get a Class 1 building by trading two Class 2 buildings for it.
  In the third rule, it's impossible to get two Class 3 buildings by trading a Class 2 building for them.
  Therefore, the only possible trade that satisfies the conditions would be for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (Class 1) for two class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp. 
  Thus, RealProp will have two Class 3 buildings, Southco will have one building of each class, and Trustcorp will have one Class 1 building, one Class 3 building, and one Class 2 building.
  The only option that fits this scenario is option D.

  From the information provided, we know that there are only three types of trades that can be made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A class 1 building can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  A class 2 building can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, and Southco can only trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Since Trustcorp owns all the class 2 buildings, it can only trade those buildings for class 3 buildings.
  From the answer choices, only option E has the correct combination of buildings and classes that are allowed to be traded.

  In order to make only one trade, the type of trade must be one of the following:
  1- Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  2- Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  3- Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  In order to end up with the given options, all class 2 and class 3 buildings should be traded, since a class 1 building cannot be traded for a class 3 building. 
  Also, the class 2 buildings can only be traded for other class 2 buildings or class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, to end up with option E, the following trades can be made:

  RealProp has a class 1 building, a class 3 building, and another class 3 building.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The only way to move a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings, or to trade it for another class 1 building.
  Based on the above information, it is impossible for RealProp to give up its class 1 building and receive a class 1 building from either Southco or Trustcorp.
  The only way for RealProp to move one of its class 3 buildings is to do so in exchange for one of Southco's class 2 buildings, or one of Trustcorp's three class 2 buildings.
  Based on the above information, it is impossible for RealProp to give up one of its class 3 buildings and receive a class 2 building from Southco.

  The only way for Trustcorp to dispose of one of its class 2 buildings is to do so in exchange for one of Southco's class 2 buildings, or for one of RealProp's class 3 buildings.
  Based on the above information, it is impossible for Trustcorp to give up one of its class 2 buildings and receive two class 3 buildings in exchange from either RealProp or Southco.
  Option A:
    RealProp must give up its class 1 building to trade with Southco.
    However, there is no combination of buildings that Southco can give up to RealProp that will allow RealProp to receive the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
    Therefore, Option A is incorrect.
  Option B:
    RealProp can give up its class 1 building (Garza Tower) to Trustcorp in exchange for the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building.
    Southco can give up the Lynch Building to RealProp in exchange for the Yates House.
    Therefore, Option B is possible.
  Option C:
    RealProp can give up one of its class 3 buildings in exchange for one of Southco's class 2 buildings.
    Trustcorp cannot give up one of its class 2 buildings in exchange for two class 3 buildings.

To satisfy the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play, we need to rule out the possibility that all students review different plays.

It is not possible to select two French novels because we can only select at most 4 French works.

  At least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
  First, we see that the organizer must choose at least three novels, which means they must select at least one of the French novels and one of the Russian novels.
  
  Next, we know that at least as many French novels as Russian novels must be selected. Therefore, the organizer must select at least one more French novel (total of 2) and at most one more Russian novel (total of 2).
  
  Now, we need to decide whether the organizer must select one French play and one Russian play or if both French plays can be selected. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play cannot be selected. Therefore, the organizer must select one French play and one Russian play.

If we select four novels, we must have at least two French novels and two Russian novels (since we can't select more than four French works).
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. This means we can select at most one French play and the Russian play (or none of them).

  The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

  Trustcorp can trade any of its buildings for one building of the same class, two buildings of the next lower class, or one building of the same class and one building of the next higher class.
  Therefore, we can determine the possible combinations of buildings that each company can own after the trades.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower:
    RealProp can only trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings. Thus, if it trades the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, it can't have the Flores Tower as well because Southco only owns one class 1 building.
    A cannot be true.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building:
    Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building. If it trades the Flores Tower for two class 2 buildings, it can only have, at most, two class 2 buildings. Therefore, it can't also own the Meyer Building, which is class 2.
    B cannot be true.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
    Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building. If it trades the Garza Tower for either two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings, it can still own the Lynch Building, which is class 2.

    Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings. It can trade one of them for one class 1 building and one class 3 building, but it can't have two class 1 buildings and one class 3 building.
    D cannot be true.

- We need to come up with an order of 6 auditions that satisfies all the given constraints. 
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Hence, the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
- The fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition must be the first, second, or the third audition.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, if Kammer's audition is not the first one, then it must be the second audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. This means that either Zinn's audition is first or second or Yoshida's audition is the last one.
- Finally, we need to make sure that the fourth audition is not recorded.

Let's evaluate the answer options:

A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
- Kammer's audition is not first or second.
- Trillo's audition must be after Kammer's audition.
- Zinn's audition is in the middle.
- The fourth audition is either Kammer's or Lugo's, but both are recorded, so this order is not valid.

B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
- Waite's audition is the first.
- Kammer's audition is the second.
- Yoshida's audition is before the last.
- The fourth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's.
- Trillo's audition is the last.
- This order satisfies all the given constraints, so this is the correct answer.

C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
- Waite's audition is the first.
- Lugo's audition is the second.
- Kammer's audition is the third.
- Trillo's audition is the fourth (which is not allowed).
- This order violates the constraint that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.

D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
- Waite's audition is the first.
- Zinn's audition is the second.
- Kammer's audition is the third.
- Trillo's audition is the fourth (which is not allowed).
- This order violates the constraint that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.

E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
- Zinn's audition is the first.
- Yoshida's audition is the second (which is recorded).
- Waite's audition is the third.
- Lugo's audition is the fourth (which is recorded).
- Kammer's audition is the fifth (which is recorded).
- Trillo's audition is the last.
- This order satisfies all the given constraints, but it violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, this order is not valid.

The only valid order is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo. Therefore, the answer is B. Answer(""B"")

  There are six auditions, and we need to arrange them in an order that satisfies the given conditions.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  So, the fifth audition has to be one of the two recorded auditions: Kammer or Lugo.
  Kammer's audition has to occur before Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition has to occur before Yoshida's audition.
  Waite's audition must occur before the two recorded auditions.
  Let's try to apply these conditions to each option:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida - This order violates the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded.
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo - This order satisfies all conditions.
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida - This order violates the condition that Kammer's audition has to occur before Trillo's audition.
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida - This order satisfies all conditions.

  3. The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  4. The fifth audition must be recorded.
  5. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  
  Since the fifth audition must be recorded, we know that Lugo's must be the fifth audition, so the order of the auditions must start with either Waite or Kammer.
  Because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, we know that Waite's audition must be the first or second audition.
  Because the fourth audition cannot be recorded, we know that the fourth audition most likely will be one of the unrecorded auditions, so we can eliminate choices A, B, and E, as they have the fourth audition as one of the recorded auditions.

  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the other two students assigned to the project will be Louis and Mollie/Tiffany.
  From the given conditions, Louis can only be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is not assigned to this project. However, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Thus, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924. This eliminates choices A and D.
  Yoshio is one of the two students assigned to the project. Yoshio can be assigned only to 1921, 1922, or 1924. Since Onyx is assigned to 1922, and if Mollie is not assigned to 1921, Yoshio must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, E is not correct.

  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 1 or wall 2 would have both Hidalgo's oil and watercolor displayed on it. That will violate the condition ""No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.""
  Option A can be true because Franz's watercolor can be displayed on a different wall than Greene's oil.
  Option C can be true because Greene's oil can be displayed in the lower position.
  Option D can be true because Hidalgo's watercolor can be displayed in the lower position.
  Option E can be true because Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on a different wall than Hidalgo's oil.

  From the conditions, we know that:
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs’s oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  Let's check each choice:
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz’s oil is displayed on a different wall than Greene’s watercolor. This means that the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed must have either Hidalgo or Isaacs's paintings, but the latter is not possible since Isaacs can't be on the same wall as Franz. Thus, Hidalgo’s paintings must be on the same wall as Franz, but he still has one more painting left that has to go on another wall. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  B: Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's oil can be on the same wall, so B can be true.
  C: This is true based on the condition that Greene’s watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz’s oil is displayed. Therefore, C cannot be the answer.
  D: This is true because Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, D cannot be the answer.
  E: This is true since Franz can't be on the same wall as Isaacs. Thus, Isaacs must be on the same wall as Hidalgo, and Hidalgo's oil painting is on a different wall. Therefore, E cannot be the answer.

  We can use the given conditions to eliminate answer choices that cannot be true.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, therefore, one of Isaacs's paintings is already placed.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Thus, we can use these conditions to eliminate answer choices.
  (A) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. This is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  (B) Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. This is possible because no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  (C) Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. This is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the same wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

However, this violates the condition that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  C: We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this statement cannot be false, and it must be true.
  D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it. However, this violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.

  Because every wall must have one painting of oil and one painting of watercolor, we must organize our notes to ensure each student has one painting of oil and one painting of watercolor.
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. This means that Isaacs must have a watercolor painting displayed in the upper position of any other wall.
  We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Franz must have a watercolor painting displayed in the lower position of another wall.

Therefore, if Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, and Tiao (or Udall) will each have to work in a different zone. This is impossible because there are only two zones left, and there are three sales representatives who need to be placed in those zones: Kim, Mahr, and Tiao (or Udall).

  Therefore, the saxophonist must perform sixth.
  The violinist must perform before the saxophonist does.
  Therefore, the violinist performs fourth and the keyboard player performs second.
  The guitarist performs last.
  The answer is C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

  - Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  - Sandpipers lecture is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  - Terns lecture is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  
  It is not possible to determine all of the exact locations of the lectures, but we can determine some of them.
  
  If three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, and the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the third lecture cannot be in Gladwyn Hall. It must be in Howard Auditorium. 

  If the lecture on sandpipers is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers and the lecture on oystercatchers is in Gladwyn Hall, then the lecture on sandpipers must be the fourth lecture and in Howard Auditorium. If sandpipers were in Gladwyn Hall, then oystercatchers would need to be later than sandpipers, which would violate the problem's conditions.

  From the previous deductions, we can now determine that the lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall. And, since the lecture on terns is earlier than the lecture on petrels, it must also be in Gladwyn Hall. 

  Now we know that lectures 1, 3, and 5 are in Gladwyn Hall, and lectures 2 and 4 are in Howard Auditorium.

  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then:
    The bay holding produce may be Bay 5 (and the bay holding livestock may be Bay 4).
    The bay holding produce may be Bay 6 (and the bay holding livestock may be Bay 5).
  In either case, Bay 4 is not holding produce.

  We can start by using the clues given to create a diagram.

    Bay #   1   2   3   4   5   6
    Cargo   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?   ?

  * The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  * The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  * The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  * The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.

    Bay #   1   2   3   4   5   6
    Cargo   ?  F/P  ?   T   L   G
  
  Since textiles is next to produce, so it can only occupy bay 3 or bay 5. 
  Bay 6 must hold the grain, so bay 2 must hold the fuel.
  From the given conditions, the only spot for livestock is bay 5 since it is the only spot left for something to be placed above textiles. 
  That leaves produce to be at bay 4.
  Thus, the answer is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel, which is incorrect as bay 2 holds produce/fuel.

  We also know that F and M are placed on the same shelf. If F is not placed on the top shelf, then more books would be placed on the top shelf than on the bottom shelf, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, F is placed on the top shelf and M on the middle shelf. 
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the bottom shelf.

  We need to determine which assignment is enough to uniquely determine the parking space of each employee.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young and a parking space from #1 to #4. So, Robertson can only be assigned parking space #4. 
  With the above information, we have the following table:
  
| Employee | Parking Space |

| Robertson| 4             |

  To solve this problem, we need to use logic and make inferences from the given conditions.
  Let's first write down the important points:
  - Three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - We need to find the false statement if one kind of cookie’s first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie’s third batch.

  Let's try to infer what we can from the given conditions:
  - There are 3 kinds of cookies and 3 batches each, so there are a total of 9 batches.
  - From the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, we can deduce that each day has exactly one batch of each of the three kinds of cookies.
  - From the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, we can deduce that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Monday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday.
  - From the condition that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, we can deduce that the first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

  Let's now look at each option to see which one could be false:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
     This statement must be true according to the given conditions because each of the three kinds of cookies must be baked exactly once on each day of the week.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
     This statement could be true or false. If the third batch of peanut butter cookies and the first batch of sugar cookies are both made on Wednesday, then this statement is true. Otherwise, it is false.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
     This statement is false because we know from the given conditions that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we know that each day must have exactly one batch of each kind of cookie.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
     This statement could be true or false. If the first batches of oatmeal and sugar cookies are both made on Tuesday, then this statement is true. Otherwise, it is false.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
     This statement must be true according to the given conditions because each of the three kinds of cookies must be baked exactly once on each day of the week.

  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member since Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member.
  Since Wells cannot be a project member if Verma is not, then there are two cases:
  (1) Wells is not a project member: In this case, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader and a project member. So either Quinn or Ruiz must be chosen, but not both since exactly 3 workers will be selected. This means that there is one more worker to choose from Xue and Verma, so one of them must be a project member.
  (2) Wells is a project member: In this case, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member. So one project leader and two project members must be chosen from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. Since exactly one of the project members will be the project leader, there are two cases: (i) the project leader is Quinn or Wells and (ii) the project leader is Smith or Xue. In both cases, there is only one worker left to choose, so that worker must be a project member.

  Based on the constraints given, the pharmacy has to be at one end of the row which means that there are two possible arrangements for the pharmacy: (1) at space 1 and the restaurant at space 7, or (2) at space 7 and the restaurant at space 1.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, which means that there are three possible arrangements for them: (1) restaurant-pharmacy-4 businesses-restaurant, (2) restaurant-4 businesses-pharmacy-restaurant, or (3) pharmacy-4 businesses-restaurant-restaurant.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, which means that if the pharmacy is at space 1, the optometrist or veterinarian must be at space 2. If the pharmacy is at space 7, then the optometrist or veterinarian must be at space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which means that the veterinarian must be next to either the pharmacy or the restaurant.
  Based on these constraints, let's check each answer choice:
  - Choice A: Starts with pharmacy at space 1 and restaurant at space 7, which is valid. But then the optometrist comes next to the pharmacy, which is not allowed, so A is incorrect.
  - Choice B: Starts with pharmacy at space 1 and veterinarian at space 2, which is valid. Then the optometrist is at space 3, which is allowed. The two restaurants are separated by four other businesses, which is allowed. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian, which is allowed. So B is a valid arrangement.
  - Choice C: Starts with restaurant at space 1 and the pharmacy at space 4, which is not allowed. So C is incorrect.
  - Choice D: Starts with restaurant at space 1 and the toy store at space 2, which is not allowed. So D is incorrect.
  - Choice E: Starts with restaurant at space 1 and the optometrist at space 2, which is allowed. Then the toy store is at space 3, which is not allowed. So E is incorrect.

However, this would mean that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are not by Gagnon, which violates the given condition. Therefore, we can eliminate choice E.
  Now, we are left with two choices: B and C.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This means that both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Gagnon, which satisfies the given condition. Additionally, there are no restrictions on the photographers for the Metro section, so it is possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes. Therefore, choice B is a valid option.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes. However, this would mean that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are not by Gagnon or Hue, which violates the given condition. Therefore, we can eliminate choice C.
  Therefore, the answer is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

  We know that there are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  There are three sections: Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports
  Two photographs per section for a total of six different photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot appear in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must appear in either the Lifestyle or Metro section. Since each photographer must be represented in at least one section, the remaining photographer in the section with both Gagnon photographs must be either Fuentes or Hue. From the given answer choices, the only option that satisfies this condition is D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.

  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there are only two sections left where Gagnon's photos could appear. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, therefore, the two sections left are Lifestyle and Metro.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear. If Gagnon has two photos in one section, then Gagnon cannot have any photo in the other two sections. This means that the two photos in each of the other two sections must be taken by two different photographers.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that if the two photos in the Lifestyle section are taken by two different photographers, then one of them must also have a photo in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
  (1) Gagnon has both photos in the Lifestyle section. This means that the other two sections must have two different photographers. Since none of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section, then Hue and Fuentes must have one photo each in the Metro and Sports sections. Therefore, both photos in the Metro section are not by Fuentes, and both photos in the Sports section are not by Hue. This eliminates choices C and E. 
  (2) Gagnon has both photos in the Metro section. This means that the other two sections must have two different photographers. Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then one of the photos in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon. This violates the condition that Gagnon cannot have any photo in the other two sections. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  (3) Gagnon has both photos in the Sports section. This means that the other two sections must have two different photographers. Since the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section, then Hue and Fuentes must have one photo each in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.

  Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it means the earliest date the sundial could be auctioned is June 2nd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the earliest date the mirror and the vase could be auctioned is June 3rd.
  The harmonica must be auctioned on a later date than the lamp. If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the harmonica would be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which is not allowed. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the earliest date the harmonica could be auctioned is June 4th. However, the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th because on those dates the harmonica and the vase have not yet been auctioned. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd either.
  The earliest date the lamp could be auctioned is June 4th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, then the earliest date the harmonica could be auctioned is June 5th, and the earliest date the vase could be auctioned is June 6th. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st. 
  The mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because on that date the lamp has not yet been auctioned. The earliest date the mirror could be auctioned is June 4th.
  None of the antiques can be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because this would mean the harmonica would be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, which is not allowed.

  We are given six antiques that will be auctioned over six consecutive days.
  We are also given several conditions that specify the order in which the antiques will be auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, because the harmonica could not be auctioned on a later date than the lamp. 
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th, otherwise neither the mirror nor the vase could be auctioned.
  Using these constraints, we can eliminate some options.
  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. Since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, it must be auctioned on June 2nd. But, the condition that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp implies that the harmonica cannot be auctioned earlier than the mirror. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. Since the harmonica cannot be auctioned earlier than the lamp, it must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st. The table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This leaves only June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th for the vase and the mirror. The vase cannot be auctioned on June 4th, otherwise the table could not be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. If the vase is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date. Therefore, the lamp could be auctioned on June 2nd. 
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is not possible because if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd if the harmonica is auctioned earlier.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 2nd if the lamp is auctioned on an earlier date, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.

  The sundial must be auctioned on a date earlier than the mirror and vase.
  The table must be auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  From the rules, we can conclude that there are only three possible orders: 
  1) Sundial, table, lamp, harmonica, vase, mirror;

  We know that screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M. However, we don't know which screen is showing which movie.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does. This means the western should be scheduled before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it should be scheduled in screens 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it should be scheduled in screen 1 or 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so it should be scheduled in screens 1 and 2, but on different times.
  Choice A: the sci-fi film, the horror film. This is possible since the horror film could be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1 while the sci-fi film could be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1.
  Choice B: the sci-fi film, the mystery. This is possible since the horror film and the mystery should be shown on different screens.
  Choice C: the western, the horror film. This is possible since the western should be scheduled before the horror film.
  Choice D: the western, the mystery. This is possible since the western should be scheduled before the horror film and the mystery should be scheduled on a different screen than the horror film.
  Choice E: the western, the sci-fi film. This is NOT possible since the sci-fi film can only be scheduled in screens 1 or 2 and the western should be scheduled before the horror film, which means it must be scheduled in screen 1 or 2.

  From the first sentence, we know there are seven sales representatives.
  From the second sentence, we know there are three sales zones, so one of the zones has three sales representatives, and the other two zones have two sales representatives each.
  From the third sentence, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. So the other person must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. The same goes for Tiao or Udall. 
  From the fourth sentence, Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and from the fifth sentence, Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. So either (Parra, Quinn), (Stuckey, Udall) and (Kim, Mahr, Tiao/Udall) are all in the same zone or they are split between the three zones.
  From the sixth sentence, there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This means that either Zone 3 has three representatives and one of the other two zones has two, or Zone 3 has four representatives and one of the other zones has one.
  Option A: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then at most one of Parra and Tiao can be in Zone 1, and at most one of Tiao and Udall can be in Zone 2. This would imply that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 2 or Zone 3, which would make it impossible for there to be more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this is false.
  Option B: If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then at most one of Parra and Tiao can be in Zone 1, and at most one of Tiao and Udall can be in Zone 2. This would imply that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1 or Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall are in the other one of those two zones. This arrangement is possible, so this could be true.
  Option C: If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then at most one of Parra and Tiao can be in Zone 1, and at most one of Tiao and Udall can be in Zone 2. This would imply that Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1 or Zone 2, and the other one of those two sales representatives is in Zone 3. This arrangement is possible, so this could be true.
  Option D: If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1. This arrangement is possible, so this could be true.
  Option E: If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1, which would mean that Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. However, this would imply that there are more representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which would contradict the sixth sentence. Therefore, this is false.

  To solve this question, we can use a process of elimination to determine which statement must be false based on the given conditions.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, so Kim and Stuckey can't both work in Zone 1. Hence, statement A is false. 
  From the given conditions, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, statement B is possible since it is not explicitly ruled out by the given conditions. 
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Therefore, if Mahr works in Zone 3, then statement C would be true. However, if Mahr works in Zone 1, then statement C would be false. Since we don't know where Mahr works, statement C is not necessarily false and we cannot select it as the answer. 
  From the given conditions, we know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, it is possible that Udall and Mahr both work in Zone 3, which means statement D is not necessarily false.

A. If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then one breed will be left that is not featured for any of the days, which is not possible as there are three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
B. Greyhounds are featured on day 1, which means Himalayans will not be featured on day 1. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, which means there is no way they can be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
C. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Greyhounds are featured on day 1. Therefore, Himalayans cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.

  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  To determine which one of the following could be true, we need to check each statement against the given conditions.
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
     Since there are only six breeds, it's impossible for there to be four breeds featured on three days each.
     Therefore, A is false.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
     Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
     Therefore, B is false.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
     Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
     Therefore, C is false.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
     Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
     Therefore, D could be true.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.

  Bay 1 can only be holding livestock.
  Bay 2 cannot be holding grain, produce, or textiles, so it must be holding machinery.

  We need to determine which statement will allow us to fully determine which shelves each book is placed on.
  From the conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If we know that K and G are placed on the same shelf, we can figure out which shelf each book is placed on.
  However, we do not have any information about where G should be placed, so this is not enough information.
  Similarly, if we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf, we still do not have enough information to determine where the other books should be placed.
  If we know that H and O are placed on the same shelf, we still do not have enough information to determine where the other books should be placed.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, we can determine that F must be on the top shelf, K must be on the bottom shelf, and O must be on the middle shelf.
  If we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf, we can determine that K must be on the bottom shelf, I must be on the middle shelf, and O must be on the top shelf.

  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If we know that two books are on the same shelf, we can determine which shelf the other book on the same shelf will be.

  Since there are 8 books and 3 shelves, there must be at least two shelves that contain two books.

    3- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
    4- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.

  From (1), the bottom shelf must contain at least 3 books while the top shelf must contain at most 2 books.

  From (4), O and L cannot be on the same shelf, O>L.
  From (5), F and M must be on the same shelf.
  From (2), I must be on the middle shelf and it has only one book which means neither M nor F can be on the middle shelf.
  Thus, M and F must be on the top shelf together or the bottom shelf together. Therefore, the only statement that can fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is (C) L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  If L and O are both on the bottom shelf, then we have 4 books on the bottom shelf, 2 on the top shelf, and 2 on the middle shelf. Also, K must be on the middle or top shelf, meaning F will be on the middle or bottom shelf. But this contradicts the fact that F and M share the same shelf. 
  Therefore, L and O cannot both be on the bottom shelf, meaning 3 books must be on the bottom shelf and 2 on the top shelf.
  If K is on the top shelf, then F must be on the middle shelf and M must be on the bottom shelf. But this contradicts the fact that K is on a higher shelf than F, and F and M share a shelf.
  Therefore, K must be on the middle shelf, F and M on the bottom shelf, and H and G must be on the top shelf.

  - O is on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is on the same shelf as M.

  If I is on the middle shelf, then there are 2 books on the middle shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf. 
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K is either on the top shelf or middle shelf and F is either on the middle shelf or bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O is either on the top shelf or middle shelf and L is either on the middle shelf or bottom shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, they both are either on the middle shelf or bottom shelf.
  
  Now, we need to find the statement that helps us to determine the placement of all books:
  - Statement A only gives information about 2 books (I and M), it does not help us determine where the other books are placed.
  - Statement B only gives information about 2 books (K and G), it does not help us determine where the other books are placed.
  - Statement C tells us that L and F are on the same shelf, but we don't know which shelf that is. It does not help us determine where the other books are placed.
  - Statement D only gives information about 2 books (M and H), it does not help us determine where the other books are placed.
  - Statement E only gives information about 2 books (H and O), it does not help us determine where the other books are placed.

If G is followed by R, then the order could be QSRGJR, which satisfies all conditions. If G is followed by J, then the order could be QSRGJYR, which satisfies all conditions. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  D: If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles must be QSRGJY. We know that G must be followed by R, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  E: If Y is fifth, then the order of the first four articles must be QSRG. We know that S must be earlier than Y, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.

  From the conditions given:
    - J < G < R (1)
    - S < Y (2)
    - Q can only be third if S is before it (3)
    - No consecutive articles can cover the same topic as each other.
  If H is fourth or sixth, we do not know the position of Q, R, or S.
  If R is fourth or Y is fifth, we don't know the positions of Q, S, G, or J.
  However, if R is seventh, we know that G must be first, J must be second, R must be seventh, and the remaining four articles must be in the order QSYH.

To decide the order of the articles, we can start with the articles that have some restrictions.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
- Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.

Based on the given conditions, we can make the following inferences:
- G, J, and R must be edited in this order.
- The three finance articles and the three nutrition articles must alternate with each other.
- We know the following order: G, J, R, Q, S. We also know that S must be earlier than Y.

Now, we can try to fit the remaining articles in the order. 
- We can add H after G since H covers finance.
- Y must be edited last, and we know the order is G, J, R, Q, S, H. So, Y must be edited after H.

Therefore, the order in which articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.

  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  The order of the finance articles and the nutrition articles must alternate because of the first condition.
  Therefore, the order of the articles is determined by either knowing the order of the nutrition articles or knowing the order of the finance articles.
  From the conditions given in the problem, we know that S must come before Q and Q must come before R.
  If R is fourth, that means Q is third, so S comes before Q and Q comes before R. We can then alternate the remaining nutrition and finance articles. The order would be S, Q, R, G, H, J, Y.

  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, the only antiques left to auction on June 4th or 5th are the harmonica, the lamp, and the mirror.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it can only be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.

- We know that the table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase, so the table must be either on June 5th or 6th.
- If the table is on June 6th, then the vase and the mirror must be on June 3rd or 4th. We also know that the sundial is before the vase, so it must be on June 1st or June 2nd. This means the harmonica must be on June 1st if it is before the lamp, and the lamp must be on June 2nd. This leaves the mirror for June 3rd and the vase for June 4th. But this configuration violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

  Table is auctioned after both mirror and vase. So, the order of the three must be mirror, vase, and then the table.
  Harmonica should be auctioned before the lamp.
  Then, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  So the only options are June 3, 4, 5, and 6 for harmonica and the lamp.
  Harmonica should be auctioned before the lamp. So there are only two possibilities for the order: harmonica-lamp or lamp-harmonica.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.

  Turquoise is not used with peach, so it must be paired with either forest, olive, white, or yellow (any two of them) in a multicolored rug.
  
  Yellow cannot be paired with peach, so it must be paired with either forest, olive, white, or turquoise (any two of them) in a multicolored rug.
  
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that Peach is used in one of the rugs. The answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.

  From the rules, we know that:
  - Exactly five colors will be used to weave the three rugs.
  - Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  - In any rug where white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug where olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  
  To answer the question, we need to analyze each of the statements and find the ones that MUST be true based on the rules.

  Statement A: It is possible to have a multicolored rug in which forest is used, as long as it is not combined with turquoise. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  Statement B: According to the rules, forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. This means that if turquoise is used, it must be a solid-colored rug. Therefore, this statement must be true.
  
  Statement C: The use of peach in a rug is not mandatory. However, if olive is used in a rug, then peach must also be used in that same rug. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  Statement D: Turquoise cannot be used in the same rug as forest or peach. However, it can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  Statement E: There is no restriction on the use of yellow in the same rug with any other colors. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  Based on the above analysis, the only statement that MUST be true is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.

  - Based on the rules given, the following pairs cannot be in the same rug: (forest, turquoise), (peach, turquoise), and (peach, yellow).
  - If there are 5 colors in total, and 2 colors have to be used in a rug with white, then that means that there are only 3 colors left that can be used in that rug.
  - Similarly, since olive requires peach, there are only 3 colors left that can be used in an olive rug.
  - From the above two deductions, we know that there can be at most 3 colors in a rug with either white or olive.
  - Since there are 5 colors in total, and there are exactly 5 colors used across the three rugs, the remaining 2 colors not used in any rug must be (forest, turquoise).
  - Based on the above deductions, we can make the following inferences:
    * Forest cannot be in any multicolored rug since it cannot be paired with turquoise.
    * Turquoise can only be used in a multicolored rug with exactly two colors since it cannot be paired with forest, peach, or yellow.
    * Peach must be used in a rug since it is required by olive.
    * Yellow must be used in a rug since it is one of the two colors not used in any rug.

  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921. In this case, Mollie cannot be assigned to any year. Therefore, this is a possible scenario.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 and 1925. In this case, the year 1925 is not available, therefore this is not a possible scenario.

  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Therefore, T must be performed fifth if F is performed immediately after R. Or, T must be performed seventh if F is performed immediately before T.
  
  If L or H is the eighth composition, then P cannot be performed before S because P must be performed before L or H. Therefore, the eighth composition must be L or H. Thus, P must be performed after S.
  
  Since O is performed either first or fifth, if O is performed first, then F and R must be performed in the positions of sixth and seventh. Otherwise, if O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed in the positions of second and third. In either case, the order of F and R is not yet determined.
  
  Since at least one composition is performed either after O and before S or after S and before O, if O is performed first, then at least one composition is performed between O and S. Otherwise, if O is performed fifth, then at least one composition is performed between S and O. Therefore, one of the following subcases must apply:
  1. O is performed first, and P is performed second. Then, S must be performed sixth because P must be performed before S, and at least one composition is performed between O and S.

  3. S is performed first, and O is performed second. Then, P must be performed after S, but before T. Then, F and R must be performed between P and T.

- O is performed either first or fifth.
- The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
- P is performed at some time before S.

Next, we know that S is performed fourth. Therefore, we have to choose two compositions from F, H, L, R, and T to be performed before S. According to the given conditions, we know that:
- T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
- At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.

There are a few possibilities for this, but we can eliminate some based on the fixed positions we found earlier. For example, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, so we cannot have both F and R performed before O.

Let's try out each of the choices:
A: F, H, P
If we choose F and R to be performed before S, then we must have T performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. This means that T cannot be performed in the third position, and this choice is not possible.

B: H, P. L
If we choose F and R to be performed after S, then we can have H, P, and L performed in the first three positions. This choice is possible.

C: O, P, R
If O is performed first, then we cannot have both F and R performed before S. If O is performed fifth, then we cannot have both F and R performed after S. Therefore, this choice is not possible.

D: O, P, T
If we choose F and R to be performed before S, then we cannot have T performed in the third position. If we choose F and R to be performed after S, then we can have O, P, and T performed in the first three positions. This choice is possible.

E: P, R, T
If we choose F and H to be performed before S, then we must have T performed immediately after R. This means that we cannot have P, R, and T performed in the first three positions. This choice is not possible.

  Therefore, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the upper position of Wall 4.
  The lower position of Wall 4 has a watercolor that belongs to either Hidalgo or Greene.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, the lower position of Wall 4 has Hidalgo's oil.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then that wall must be wall 1 or wall 2.
  If the wall with Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil is wall 1, then wall 2 must have either Hidalgo's oil or watercolor on it along with one of Isaacs's painting (since both of Franz's paintings are already on wall 1). The remaining paintings will then be on walls 3 and 4. However, this means that all four walls have the work of only one student displayed on it, which is not allowed. Therefore, wall 1 cannot have both Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor on it.
  This means that the wall with Franz's watercolor and Greene's oil must be wall 2. Therefore, Franz's oil must be on wall 1, and the other two paintings on wall 1 must be by Hidalgo and Isaacs (in some order). Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 3. Hidalgo's watercolor cannot go on wall 4 because that would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be on wall 1.
  We have determined the following:
  - Wall 1 has Franz's oil painting, Hidalgo's watercolor painting, and either Greene's or Isaacs's painting (we don't know which one yet).
  - Wall 2 has Franz's watercolor painting and Greene's oil painting.
  - Wall 3 has Isaacs's watercolor painting and Hidalgo's oil painting.
  - Wall 4 has Isaacs's oil painting and either Greene's or Hidalgo's painting (whichever one is not on wall 1).
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's oil must be on wall 2, and Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 1. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 4, and the remaining painting on wall 4 must be Greene's or Isaacs's watercolor (we don't know which one).

  If Franz's watercolor is not displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Greene's oil will be the only artwork by Franz on one of the walls, which will break the condition that no wall has only one student's work on it.
  Suppose Greene's oil is displayed on wall 1 with Franz's watercolor. Then, according to the condition, Greene's watercolor will be displayed in the lower position of wall 1. Also, Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the wall with Hidalgo's work since neither Franz nor Isaacs can share the same wall with Hidalgo. Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil.
  Since Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 1, neither wall 3 nor 4 can have all watercolors on it. Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be on wall 3 or 4. But, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4, then Isaacs will have both his artworks on wall 4, which is not allowed. Thus, Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 3. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 1.

  We know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there must be at least three batches of cookies made between Monday and Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday as well. This means that no peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so no sugar cookies can be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, and we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, then the maximum number of batches of cookies that can be made on Friday is two. This means that one batch of cookies must be made on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  
Analysis of Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and no sugar cookies can be made on Monday.
  B: If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Tuesday. This means that no peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. This choice is possible.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because we know that only one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then no peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, which contradicts the information given in the problem statement.
  E: If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Tuesday. This means that no oatmeal cookies can be made on Wednesday, so the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday. This choice is not possible.

Therefore, the possible choice is B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.

  We know at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then two batches are made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then there would be two batches of sugar cookies on Monday which is not allowed.

  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, there are two possibilities - either one batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies are made OR one batch of oatmeal cookies, two batches of peanut butter cookies, and no batch of sugar cookies are made.
  We can go through each choice to determine which one is possible given the timeline of cookies made from Monday to Friday.
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
    This is not possible since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
    This is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
    This is possible since one batch of oatmeal cookies is made each day from Wednesday to Friday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
    This is not possible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

  We need to determine which scenario is possible if only one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Friday, then we already know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Thus, no sugar cookies are made on Friday.
  We are given that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day so we can eliminate option A.
  We know the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday (option D), then the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday as well. Therefore, we can eliminate option D.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday (option B), then the first batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday. Therefore, we can eliminate option B.
  We are left with options C and E.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday (option C), then the second batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Wednesday. Therefore, option C is possible.
  If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday (option E), then the first batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Monday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday. Therefore, option E is not possible because the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.

  Each kind of cookie has three batches, so there are a total of 9 batches of cookies.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are 2 batches made on Thursday and 1 batch made on Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on either Monday or Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
Solution:
  From the conditions given, it can be concluded that the following statements are true:
  - The first batch of sugar cookies is not made on Friday.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday or Friday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Thursday.

  This question is about scheduling of students to work at a campus art gallery.
  We need to go through each answer choice to check if the schedule meets all the restrictions mentioned in the context.
  According to the restrictions, Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days.
  Grecia works the first shift on two nonconsecutive days.
  Katya works on Tuesday and Friday.
  Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once.
  Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other.
  Let's check each answer choice to find the one that satisfies all the restrictions.
  
  A: K, L, M, and O work in the fall. N and P work in spring.
  This schedule doesn't state which shifts each student works, so we cannot determine if it meets the restrictions.
  
  B: K, L, N, and O work in the fall. M and P work in spring.
  This schedule doesn't state which shifts each student works, so we cannot determine if it meets the restrictions.
  
  C: K, L, N, and P work in the fall. M, and O work in spring.
  This schedule doesn't mention the shifts worked by each student, so we cannot determine if it meets the restrictions.
  
  D: K, M, N, and O work in the fall. L and P work in spring.
  This schedule doesn't state which days each student works, so we cannot determine if it meets the restrictions.
  
  E: M and O work in the fall. K, L, N, and P work in spring.
  This schedule doesn't state which shifts each student works, so we cannot determine if it meets the restrictions.
  
  None of the answer choices provides a clear schedule that meets all the restrictions given in the question. Therefore, the answer is ""None of the above.""

  To determine the answer, I need to find out what movies are shown on screen 1 and screen 3.
  The western is shown before the horror film, so it is either the 7 PM or 9 PM movie on screen 1 or 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it is shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  Therefore, the horror film and the mystery are shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  Using the conditions above, I can eliminate choices A and B because they both include the sci-fi film on screen 2.
  I can eliminate choice C because the western and the horror film are not shown together on screen 2.
  The only remaining choices are D and E.
  Therefore, I need to verify which of them is impossible.

  From the constraint, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  It is not possible that the pharmacy is next to the optometrist since space 1 or 7 is at the other end, so the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian.

To find the answer, we need to check which colors cannot be used in the two solid rugs, given the constraints in the context.

If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
If white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used in a solid rug.
If olive is used, peach is also used. Therefore, olive cannot be used alone in a solid rug, and it must be combined with peach.
Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in the other solid rug.
Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in the other solid rug.
Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in the other solid rug.

Let's check each choice:
A: forest and peach - If forest is used in one solid rug, it cannot be used in the other solid rug. If peach is used in one solid rug, it must be combined with olive, so it cannot be used alone in the other solid rug. Therefore, A is a possible combination of colors for the two solid rugs. 
B: forest and yellow - If forest is used in one solid rug, it cannot be used in the other solid rug. Yellow can be used in a solid rug with one of the other colors not used in the first solid rug. Therefore, B is a possible combination of colors for the two solid rugs.
C: peach and turquoise - If peach is used in one solid rug, it must be combined with olive. If turquoise is used in the other solid rug, it cannot be combined with forest. Therefore, C cannot be a combination of colors for the two solid rugs.
D: peach and yellow - If peach is used in one solid rug, it must be combined with olive. If yellow is used in the other solid rug, it cannot be combined with white. Therefore, D cannot be a combination of colors for the two solid rugs.
E: turquoise and yellow - If turquoise is used in one solid rug, it cannot be combined with peach. If yellow is used in the other solid rug, it cannot be combined with white. Therefore, E cannot be a combination of colors for the two solid rugs.

- If we select Xue along with Verma, Wells won't be selected and hence Verma cannot be the leader. So, Xue will not be selected.
- If we select Smith along with Verma, Taylor needs to be selected. But we cannot select Wells and hence cannot select Verma as the leader. So, Smith will not be selected.
- If we select Quinn or Ruiz with Verma, one of them needs to be the leader. But, if we select Quinn or Ruiz, we cannot select Verma and Wells both. So, A and B cannot be correct.

  We know that there are no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  No cookies are made on Wednesday so that means no batches of either oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar cookies are made on Wednesday.
  Thus, we need to make 1 batch of oatmeal, peanut butter and sugar cookies on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday. 
  This satisfies the given conditions. 
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. There are not more than three batches of cookies made on any given day. 
  This tells us that B is true but we are not sure about A, C, D, and E.
  However, we know that the number of batches made on Monday will be equal to the number of batches made on Tuesday and Friday combined. Therefore, option C is not true.

  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, there must be exactly one batch of cookies made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  Conclusion: The only batch of cookies that can be made on Wednesday is the second batch of peanut butter cookies.
  This means that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Monday (the oatmeal cookies and the sugar cookies), and exactly one batch of cookies are made on Tuesday (the peanut butter cookies), Wednesday (the second batch of peanut butter cookies), and Thursday (the second batch of sugar cookies).
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  From the given conditions, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. So, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made either on Monday or Tuesday. If it was made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal must have been made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter must have been made on Thursday, which means there are no batches left for Wednesday. If the second batch of sugar cookies was made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal and the first batch of peanut butter must have been made on Monday and Friday, respectively.

  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only type of trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp has made at least one trade of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings with either RealProp or Southco.

  Trustcorp owns the King Building, Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for other buildings.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, it means it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for other buildings. As a consequence, one of its buildings must have been traded for two class 3 buildings which means Trustcorp now owns a class 3 building.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are the only two class 3 buildings in the scenario, but RealProp owns the Yates House. Therefore, Trustcorp must own the Zimmer House. 
  The answer is E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.

  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only way it can trade a class 2 building.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, so it has not made a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  It can only trade a class 1 building for another class 1 building. 
  Suppose RealProp trades the class 1 building (Garza Tower) for the class 1 building (Flores Tower) owned by Southco.
  Then, Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp still owns only class 2 buildings.

  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, there are only two possible orders for them: either Wellspring performs in slot one and Xpert in slot two, or Wellspring performs in slot two and Xpert in slot three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot one, then slot two must be given to either Zircon or Vegemite. But if Zircon performs in slot two then Wellspring should perform in a slot earlier than Xpert, which contradicts the given constraints. Therefore, we can conclude that Wellspring performs in slot two and Xpert performs in slot three.
  If Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, then it could be either slot four, five or six. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it could be either slot one, two, or three. Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot five or six because those are the last two slots. Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three.
  The remaining slots are slot one, four, five, and six, and the remaining bands are Uneasy and Zircon. Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, so it cannot be in slot three.

  The Lifestyle section must have at least one photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the photographers for the photos in the Metro and Lifestyle sections must have at least one photographer in common.
  The number of Hue's photos in Lifestyle should be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in Sports. Therefore, if there are two photos from Hue in the Lifestyle section, there should be two photos by Fuentes in Sports, and if there is only one photo from Hue in the Lifestyle section, there should be one photo by Fuentes in Sports.
  For each photographer, there should be at least one, but no more than three of their photos. Therefore, if Hue has two photos, then Gagnon cannot have any photos in the Sports section.
  Let's check each choice:
  A: Both photos in Lifestyle are by Fuentes, the Metro section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Hue, and the Sports section has one photo by Gagnon and one by Hue. This choice satisfies all the conditions, so it could be an acceptable selection. 
  B: The Lifestyle section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Gagnon, the Metro section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Gagnon, and the Sports section has both photos by Hue. This selection does not satisfy the condition that there must be at least one photo from a photographer who appears in both the Lifestyle and Metro sections. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.
  C: The Lifestyle section has both photos by Fuentes, the Metro section has both photos by Gagnon, and the Sports section has both photos by Hue. This choice does not satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section. Therefore, this choice is not acceptable.
  D: The Lifestyle section has both photos by Gagnon, the Metro section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Gagnon, and the Sports section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Hue. This selection satisfies all the conditions, so it could be acceptable.
  E: The Lifestyle section has one photo by Gagnon and one by Hue, the Metro section has both photos by Hue, and the Sports section has one photo by Fuentes and one by Hue. This selection does not satisfy the condition that the number of Hue's photos in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photos in the Sports section.

  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. 
    If Siamese is featured on day 2, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2 because Himalayans are featured exactly three days. Thus, Himalayans will be featured on days 3, 4, and 5 which means Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days. Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, and there are only six days left, it is impossible to feature all three breeds of puppies. Therefore, A is not possible.
    
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
    Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 only. That means Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days so they will be featured on days 5 and 6. On day 7, only two breeds of puppies are left (Greyhound was featured on day 1). Therefore, the breed that was not featured on day 1 cannot be featured on day 7. Since Himalayans are already featured three times, they cannot be featured on day 7. Therefore, B is not possible.

  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
    Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, and 5 only. That means Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, they will be featured on day 6. Thus, on day 4 the remaining breed of puppy (Newfoundland) will be featured. Himalayans will be featured on days 2, 3, and 5, so Himalayans cannot be featured on day 4. Therefore, C is not possible.
  
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
    Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 only. That means Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days. Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, they will be featured on day 6. Thus, on day 5 Manx will be featured with the remaining breed of kitten (Siamese). Therefore, D is a possible scenario.
    
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
    Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 only. That means Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days. Since Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7, they will be featured on day 5. On day 6, only one breed of kitten is left (Himalayan), so Himalayan and Newfoundland cannot both be featured on day 6.

  We are told that the five students reviewed three plays (Sunset, Tamerlane and Undulation).
  If exactly three students reviewed Undulation, then the other two students couldn't have reviewed Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. This means that if Jiang reviews Undulation, neither Lopez nor Megregian could have reviewed Undulation since they can't review any of the same plays as Jiang.
  Since there are only three plays, and three students reviewed Undulation, all three remaining students (Kramer, Lopez and Megregian) reviewed the remaining two plays.
  From the given conditions, Kramer and Lopez each reviewed fewer plays than Megregian. This means that Megregian reviewed all three plays while Kramer and Lopez reviewed only Tamerlane and Sunset.
  Therefore, Jiang reviewed Undulation.

  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students do not review Undulation.
  From the conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the two remaining students who did not review Undulation must have reviewed Sunset and Tamerlane.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation then either Kramer or Lopez must review Undulation which violates the rule that neither Lopez nor Megregian review any play Jiang reviews.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation then either Kramer or Lopez will also review Undulation which violates the rule that exactly two students review the same play or plays.
  Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Undulation.
  The remaining possibilities are that Megregian either reviewed all three plays or only reviewed Sunset and Tamerlane.
  So, (A) and (C) could be true because we don't know which plays Megregian reviewed.
  (D) and (E) cannot be true because the given conditions state that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane and at most two students can review the same play or plays.

  Exactly three students review Undulation.
  We do not know which students review Undulation.
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the only two students that reviewed the same play or plays must be among the students who did not review Tamerlane.
  Jiang did not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian and Lopez both must review Tamerlane, which means that Kramer and O'Neill reviewed different plays.
  Therefore, Jiang can only review Sunset.
  From the above reasoning,
    If Jiang reviews Sunset and exactly three students review Undulation,
    then Megregian, Kramer, and O'Neill review Undulation,
    and Lopez does not review Undulation.
  Therefore, (A) and (D) are not true.
  To ensure that option (B) is true, let us assume that Megregian reviews Tamerlane (then he reviews two plays).
  Then, Lopez and Kramer must review only one play; we know that they must both review the same play to satisfy the requirement of exactly two students reviewing the same play.
  But we already have three students reviewing Undulation, and none of these students can be Lopez or Kramer without violating our assumption about Megregian.
  Therefore, (B) cannot be true.
  To ensure that option (E) is true, the last student, who we know reviewed one or two plays, must have reviewed both Sunset and Tamerlane, in order to make two students review the same play or plays.
  Therefore, (E) is true.

  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation should not be Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, if Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian must review the other two plays (Sunset and Tamerlane), which is not possible because Kramer reviews Tamerlane.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez review Sunset and Tamerlane.

  If exactly three students review Undulation then the other two students must have reviewed at least Sunset and or Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, thus the other student who reviewed Tamerlane is Megregian or Lopez.
  Neither Megregian nor Lopez reviews any play that Jiang reviews.
  From the list of choices, we can rule out E since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane
  If we put together the information from the conditions, the only possibility is that Megregian reviewed Tamerlane with Kramer and O'Neill:
    - Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane
    - Megregian reviewed Undulation and Tamerlane
    - That leaves Lopez and Jiang to have reviewed either Sunset or Undulation, but neither of them reviewed Undulation as that is the number of students who reviewed that. Therefore, Lopez and Jiang reviewed Sunset.

- We want to select the statement that could be true given that exactly three students review Undulation.
- If exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students may review either Sunset or Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play that Jiang reviews. Thus, Jiang reviews the third play and not Undulation.
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Thus, one of the students that reviews Undulation also reviews Tamerlane. 
- To satisfy the condition that exactly two students review the same set of plays while three others review the other set, we must have all three students that reviewed Undulation review Tamerlane as well.

  Let's count the reviews required by the prompt: since there are three plays and five students, we have to evenly distribute the reviews with option of some of them reviewing more than one play. 
  If 3 of the students review Undulation and each student reviews at least one play, there must be: (1) a pair of students reviewing Undulation only, and (2) one student who reviews Undulation and another play. 
  Based on the given conditions, we can eliminate B, D, and E. Whether Megregian reviews Undulation is unknown, so option A could be true. Also, Jiang cannot review any play reviewed by Lopez and Megregian. Therefore, it is possible that Jiang reviews Undulation. Thus, option C could also be true.

  Exactly three of the students review Undulation. So, only two students do not review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane. So, none of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Also, at least one of Lopez or Megregian reviews Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, only Lopez will be left to review it. But, in that case, Lola will review fewer plays than Megregian which is not possible.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, and Jerry and Kramer review Undulation with Jerry reviewing one more play, then Lara and Megregian can review Tamerlane and Sunset, respectively, for Barcelona to be the student who reviewed the same number of plays as Jerry.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Megregian and Lopez can review Tamerlane and Sunset, respectively, satisfying the conditions.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane as three students already reviewed Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and Jerry need to review Undulation and Tamerlane between them, and Megregian and Lopez needs to review Sunset among themselves.

  We know that the five students reviewed exactly 3 plays.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, that means the other two students should have reviewed only one play that is not Undulation.
  If Kramer and O'Neill are the two students who reviewed the same play, that means Megregian is not involved in that play.
  According to the given conditions, Kramer, Lopez, and Megregian reviewed fewer plays than Megregian. So Megregian has to be the student reviewing Tamerlane with Kramer before adding another Undulation Review so that only one possible answer is achievable.
  If O'Neill and Kramer only reviewed one play, and it's Tamerlane, then the only possible play left for Lopez, Jiang, and Megregian is Undulation.
  So Jiang does not review Undulation, Megregian does not review Sunset, one of O'Neill or Kramer must review Sunset.
  Therefore, A is true because we know Megregian has to review Tamerlane and Undulation.
  O'Neill would have to review one of the remaining plays Sunset, which means B is false.
  Jiang does not review Undulation according to our analysis, therefore C is true.
  From our previous analysis, we know Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, and there are no plays left for Lopez to have reviewed, so D is false.

  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the remaining two students have to review Tamerlane.
  According to the problem, Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane; therefore, Lopez, Jiang, and Megregian review Undulation.
  Because Megregian reviews fewer than both Kramer and Lopez, Megregian reviews only 1 Undulation.
  To satisfy the condition that only two students review the same play or plays, Jiang has to reviews only sunset.
  If Jiang reviews only Sunset, then Megregian has to review Undulation and Tamerlane, and does not review any other play.

  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  
  For each target, we can have one or two clients for each value of (website/ voicemail) target.
  Firstly, Let's see the targets that the Image client can have.
      Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So, Image's voicemail target can be 1-day maximum.
      Also, Image's website target cannot be longer than its voicemail target. This implies that Image's website target can also be 1-day maximum.
  For all possible targets, let's see if each of them can be set to more than one client.
  
  a 1-day website target: This target can be set for Image.
  
  a 2-day voicemail target: This target can be set for Solide and Truvest.
  
  a 2-day website target: This target can be set for Solide and Truvest.  
      Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
      Therefore, Truvest must have a website target longer than 2 days.
  
  a 3-day voicemail target: This target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  
  a 3-day website target: This target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
      Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building and it is allowed to trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. Hence, it could trade the class 2 Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings occupied by RealProp. Now Southco will possess one building in each class.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings. It can trade one class 2 building for one class 2 building. Thus Trustcorp can exchange one of its class 2 buildings with one owned by RealProp. The building with RealProp must be either Yates House or Zimmer House, since Garza Tower has already been traded. Thus Trustcorp will own two class 2 buildings and one class 3 building.

Combining all the above points, we arrive at the following set of trades:
RealProp: trades Garza Tower for Trustcorp's two class 2 buildings
Southco: trades Lynch Building for RealProp's two class 3 buildings
Trustcorp: trades one class 2 building for either Yates House or Zimmer House that is owned by RealProp.

This implies that A, B, and C are incorrect since they have either incorrect set of buildings or incorrect owners. This also implies that D is incorrect since it has Meyer Building owned by RealProp. The only option left is E, which matches with our derived trades and ownership constraints. Hence, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building

  To make the trade, the numbers of buildings traded between the three companies must balance out.
  To trade:
    - a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so the trade must involve Southco or Trustcorp.
  Southco also owns a class 1 building, so the trade must involve Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so the trade must be a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings. 
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. So, Trustcorp can exchange one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  After the trade, Trustcorp will have one class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.

  We need to make a trade that satisfies all three types described in the question.
  We can either trade class 1 building for 2 class 2 buildings, class 2 building for 2 class 3 buildings, or one building for another building of the same class.
  Let's determine which buildings can be traded and which buildings cannot be traded.
  Garza is class 1, therefore it can only be traded for 2 class 2 buildings. 
  Flores is class 1 and there is no class 3 building to trade it for, so it can only be traded for 2 class 2 buildings. 
  Lynch is class 2 and there are no choices to trade it for 2 class 3 buildings, so it can only be traded for a building of equal class. 
  King, Meyer and Ortiz are all class 2 and do not have any other buildings to trade for.
  Yates House and Zimmer House are both class 3 and can only be traded for 2 class 2 or 1 class 1 building.
  RealProp can trade Garza Tower for King Building and Ortiz Building.
  Southco can trade Flores Tower for Meyer Building and Yates House.
  Trustcorp can trade Lynch Building for Garza Tower.

  The possible results with this trade are:
  RealProp: Garza Tower, King Building and Ortiz Building

Before the trade, the companies had the following properties:
  RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3)
  Southco: Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2)
  Trustcorp: King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building (all class 2)

Choices A, D, and E are all impossible because there is no combination of one trade that can result in the same number of buildings of each class owned by the same company.

Choice B is impossible because, to start with, RealProp had only one class 2 building and, after the trade, it must own at least two class 2 buildings.

Choice C is possible. The trade can be:
  RealProp trades Garza Tower (class 1) for Lynch Building (class 2) and the Yates House (class 3) for two class 3 buildings: Meyer and Ortiz Buildings (class 2).
  After the trade:
  RealProp has the Lynch Building (class 2) and two class 3 buildings - Meyer and Ortiz Buildings (class 2)

  The organizer must select at least five and at most six works from a group of nine works.
  No more than four French works are selected.
  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  
  To satisfy the requirements, the organizer can select all nine books, of course. But remember, the organizer must select at least 5 but at most 6 works. So we need to eliminate 3 books out of 9 books to reach the range of 5 to 6 works.
  
  From the books available, we can make the following observations:
      1. There are 3 French novels
      2. There are 3 Russian novels
      3. There are 2 French plays
      4. There is 1 Russian plays
  To meet the requirement of at least 3 but no more than 4 novels, we can select books from both French and Russian novels.
  To satisfy the condition of having at least as many French novels as Russian novels, we should select either:
      a. Three French and three Russian novels or,
      b. Four French and three Russian novels.
  If we have four French novels, then we can only select up to two works from other categories, and they could be any of the following:
      a. One French play and one Russian play.
      b. Two French plays.
      c. One French play and one Russian novel.
      d. One Russian play and one French novel.
  
  However, if we have three French novels, then we can select up to three works from other categories, and they could be any of the following:
      a. Both French plays and one Russian novel, or,
      b. One French play and both Russian plays, or,
      c. One French play, one French novel, and one Russian novel, or
      d. One Russian play, one French novel, and one Russian novel.
      
  Therefore, we have multiple possible combinations of selecting books. In all these combinations, we can see that we must select at least two French novels. Therefore, the organizer must at least select two French novels.

Let's try to find the minimum number of works needed using the given requirements:
- From the nine works, select an equal number of three French and three Russian novels to meet the second and third requirements.
- Only one more work is needed to satisfy the first requirement. This can only be a French play since selecting another French novel will result in the selection of five French works, which is not allowed. So, only one French play is selected.
- Finally, check if the fourth requirement is met. When only one French play is selected and three French novels are selected, at least three French novels are selected, which is not less than the number of Russian novels.

  The correct choice must match this order.

  (A) Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida - violates the rule that Zinn's audition must happen before Yoshida's audition.
  (B) Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo - violates the rule that Kammer's audition must happen before Trillo's audition.
  (C) Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida - Kammer's audition happens before Trillo's audition and Zinn's audition happens before Yoshida's audition but does not follow the rule that the 5th audition must be recorded. Also, Lugo's audition should be recorded but it's not specified here.
  (D) Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida - correct order.

  We know that there are four years and four students, so each year corresponds to a different student.
  The project assignments depend on some conditions:
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. 
    - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. 
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. 
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  We also know that Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project.
  Therefore:
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's - this means Onyx will be assigned to 1921 or 1923.
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Onyx is assigned to 1923, then neither Louis nor Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, in this case, Louis will be assigned to 1921 and Tiffany can be assigned to1924.
    - From the condition, If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Ryan has already been assigned, so Tiffany cannot be assigned.
    - Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921 and Mollie must be assigned to 1922 or Louis is assigned to 1923 and Onyx must be assigned to 1921.

  Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922 before Ryan who is assigned to 1923.
  The student who will be assigned to 1921 must not be Mollie because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.

And if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Tiffany, Ryan and Onyx will be assigned to three of the remaining four years in a specific order.
  Louis is assigned to one of the remaining years, which ensures that Tiffany and Louis will not be assigned to the same year, and Louis could not be assigned to 1923 because Tiffany is already assigned to that year, which leaves only 1921 and 1924 available. Therefore, Mollie is assigned to the remaining of 1921 and 1922. If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx is assigned to 1922 and Ryan to 1924. This would mean that Yoshio should be assigned to 1923, and Louis will be assigned to 1924. This scenario would, however, lead to Ryan not being assigned to the year immediately after Onyx, resulting in a contradiction.

  Since the only other afternoon session besides Thursday belongs to Nessa, we know that neither Kevin nor Rebecca can be assigned to those sessions.

  If we put all these rules together, we can find out which session each remaining assistant gets assigned to, which should be four of them.
  1. If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, he can't lead any others.
  2. Kevin and Rebecca must be assigned to Wednesday sessions. Kevin can lead either the morning or afternoon session, but Rebecca can only lead whichever one Kevin doesn't lead.

  4. Nessa can't lead the Thursday afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.

  If Helen gives a report on Monday then Irving must also give a report that day and Nina must give her report the next day on Tuesday. This means if Nina gives a report, then it must be given on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving can't give reports on the same day
  If Robert were to give a report on Monday, then George can only give his report on Tuesday meaning that Lenore, Kyle and Nina must give reports on Wednesday. But this is impossible as Kyle and Nina can not give reports on the same day. So Robert can't give his report on Monday and so on Wednesday he must give his report.

  Let's assume that Nina gives a report on Monday:
    On Tuesday, George must give a report, and one more student will give a report (Ne, Ol, Ro, or Ky).
      If Kyle or Olivia give a report on Tuesday, then neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Wednesday.
    On Wednesday, two students must give a report: Helen and Irving.

  The remaining students are George, Lenore, Kyle, and Olivia. 
  If any of Nina, Helen, or Irving gives a report on Monday, then the remaining two must give a report on Wednesday.
  If neither of them gives a report on Monday, then one of George or Lenore must give their report on Monday. This means that the other will give her report on Wednesday; therefore, if either Helen or Irving gave a report on Monday, then the other would have to give her report on Wednesday as well.
  Based on the above conditions, we can deduce that Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday if Nina gives her report. 
  Therefore, if Lenore gives her report on the same day as Helen or Irving, she must do it on Wednesday. 
  The only pair among the given options that meet this condition is Helen and Nina. If Nina gives the report, Helen and Irving will give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen gives her report on the same day as Nina, she must give it on Wednesday. So, the answer is B: Helen and Nina.

  The condition that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report is not immediately useful to determining the answer.

  From the above notion, we can conclude that if Nina gives her report on Wednesday, neither Helen nor Irving can give a report on Wednesday.
  The possible pairs to consider are Nina-Helen, Nina-Irving, and Helen-Irving.
  If Nina and Helen give reports on Monday, Irving must give a report on Monday.
  If Nina and Helen give reports on Tuesday, Irving must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina and Irving give reports on Monday, Helen must give a report on Monday.

  There are two reports each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, which gives us three different time slots.
  There are six people who will give reports, which means three on Monday, two on Tuesday (one of whom is George), and three on Wednesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, which means they are limited to the morning timeslot.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports one day after Nina to maintain balance.
  Therefore, George cannot give a report on Monday, which means that his report will be on Tuesday morning.
  Based on this information, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday if Nina does not give a report.
  We have to select the pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they both give a report on the same day.
  The only way for a pair of students to be required to give reports on Wednesday is if they both give reports on Tuesday (after George).
  The only pair of students who could end up giving reports on Tuesday after George is Nina and Helen.
  If Nina does not give a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday, which would be the case if they both give reports on Tuesday.

  So, Garcia and Jiang must be giving the first two lectures in any order.

  Combined the third lecture cannot be either one of these two lecturers, because if so, either Jiang's or Garcia's lecture will be given last, breaking the condition that the oil paintings lecture must be before the lithographs lecture.

  One of the requirements is that at least one scientist of each of the three types is selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then two botanists must be selected. Therefore, there will be two botanists and one chemist selected.
  From the given conditions, we know that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. This means M is not selected because, if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Since P is the only zoologist, R is not selected either. This means two botanists and one chemist are selected from the following - {F,G,H} and {K,L,M} respectively.
  F and K cannot both be selected. So, if K is selected then G or H must be selected. If L is selected, then F or H must be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K because if L is selected, then it is necessary to select two botanists. 
  Option D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected violates the above constraints, as F or H must be selected if L is selected.

If P is the only zoologist selected, it means either F, G, or H has to be selected. It is given that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. That means selecting F/H will allow selecting only one zoologist that is P. Also, given that F and K cannot both be selected, therefore if K is selected, G or H has to be selected. 

Let's check the options one by one:
A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  We know that if K is selected, then either G or H has to be selected. Therefore, this option is false.

B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  There is no direct relation between L and F, so this option is also false.

C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  If only one chemist is selected, then it can be any of K, L, or M. Therefore, this option is false.

D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  If two chemists are selected, there can be combinations of (KL, KM, LM).  
  For KL, we can select either G or H as the third member. In the case of selecting H, P will be automatically selected. So, there is no relation between the selection of chemists and P.
  For KM, botanists can only be G or H. If H is selected, then either P or Q would be selected, which contradicts the given situation. Therefore only G can be the other member, but selecting G can still allow the selection of R.
  For LM, we can select either F or G as the third member. If F is selected, then H has to be the third member, which violates the condition of having at least one member from each group. So, we must select G as the third member which will allow the selection of P or R. Therefore, this option is true.

E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
  We can see from the explanation of option D that G can always be selected in the case of exactly two chemists. Thus, this option is false.
  
The only option that is true is D.

If M is not selected, then both P and R cannot be selected.
Therefore, M is selected. Also, since P is selected, R is also selected.

Similarly, if Tiao is working in Zone 1 then Parra is not working in Zone 1, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.

Similarly, if Udall is working in Zone 2 then Tiao is not working in Zone 2, and Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  Now considering that there should be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2, the possibilities based on the above conditions can be as follows:
          If Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2. In this case, Quinn is left to work with Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey in Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Tiao in this case.

  - Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.

Since Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, Yardsign would have to perform in one of the last three slots. That means Wellspring would perform in one of the first three slots. 

But since Wellspring performs earlier than Xpert who must perform later than Zircon then Zircon would have to perform in Slots 5 or 6. If Zircon performs in the fifth or sixth slots then Wellspring can perform in Slot 3.

Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform would be Slot 3.

  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Wellspring needs to perform either in slot two or slot three since Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means Xpert needs to perform at a later slot compared to Wellspring. 
  Uneasy is performing in one of the last three slots, so Wellspring cannot perform in slot six.

  Case 1: Quinn was the 2nd person recruited.
  Then, based on the information we have already, the order of recruits would be:

  Peters -> Quinn -> [X] -> Rovero -> [X] -> Villas -> White -> Tao (or Tao -> White)

  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, therefore the guitarist can perform the first, second, or third solo.
  Let's find out the placing of the guitarist's solo in all the possible scenarios.
  Scenario 1: Guitarist performs the first solo. Therefore, the percussionist cannot perform the first solo, but could perform the second or third solo. If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist can perform the third solo after the trumpet player performs the fourth solo. This scenario contradicts the given restrictions. Therefore, the percussionist performs the third solo.
  Scenario 2: Guitarist performs the second solo. Therefore, the percussionist could perform the first or third solo. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist can perform the third solo after the trumpet player performs the fourth solo. This scenario contradicts the given restrictions. Therefore, the percussionist performs the third solo.
  Scenario 3: Guitarist performs the third solo. Therefore, the percussionist could perform the first or second solo. If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist can perform the second solo after the trumpet player performs the fourth solo. This scenario contradicts the given restrictions. Therefore, the percussionist performs the second solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.

The saxophonist could perform the fifth or sixth solo, but the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does. If we look at all three scenarios mentioned above, the percussionist performs the first or second solo. Therefore, the saxophonist performs the sixth solo.
  Now, we can confirm that the trumpeter performs the fifth solo.
  Therefore, the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then he must perform the first or second solo. In both the scenarios, the violinist performs the first solo. Therefore, it must be true that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

  Therefore, only two lectures remain to be scheduled in Howard Auditorium; Lecture 5 (oystercatchers) and Lecture 3 (rails)

  * The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  
  Sandpipers is Lecture 1 since it is held in Howard Auditorium and occurs before the lecture on oystercatchers.
  Oystercatchers belong to Lecture 5.

  1. Since the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, exactly two of the remaining lectures must be given in Gladwyn Hall.
  2. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium; therefore, the lecture on sandpipers must be given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, which can be either the first or second lecture but cannot be the fourth lecture.
  3. The lecture on terns must be given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns must be either the second or the third lecture, and the lecture on petrels must be either the third or the fifth lecture. Thus, the lecture on rails must be either the second or the fifth lecture.
  4. Since the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, the lecture on sandpipers must be the fourth lecture and the lecture on oystercatchers must be either the first or second lecture. Therefore, the lecture on rails must be either the second or fifth lecture.
  Now it can be concluded that:
  * If the lecture on rails is the second lecture, then the lecture on oystercatchers is the first lecture and the lecture on petrels is the third lecture.
  * If the lecture on rails is the fifth lecture, then the lecture on oystercatchers is the second lecture and the lecture on petrels is the third lecture.
  In both cases, the fifth lecture will be either the lecture on rails or the lecture on petrels. Thus, the third and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall.

- Bays holding livestock and grain must have higher numbers than those holding textiles or fuel.
- Bay 4 holding textiles would then mean that Bay 5 must hold grain, which contradicts Bay 5 holding machinery, as each bay holds a different cargo.

  From the constraints, the bay holding grain should be Bay 6. Livestock should be in Bay 5, and Textiles should be in Bay 4.
  Bay holding produce should be Bay 3. Therefore, Bay 2 is holding fuel. That eliminates Choice A.
  The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock. Therefore, the bay holding produce and livestock are Bays 3 and 5, respectively.

  - Then, look for the answer that can be proven based on the new information from the placement of L and H.
  
  If L is placed on the top shelf (which is not allowed because at least two books should be placed on that shelf), then H must be placed on the top shelf, which implies that I is not placed on the middle shelf, which violates a condition. So, this case is invalid.
  
  Therefore, L must be located on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the bottom shelf, then we have:

  The question is asking us to find a true statement given that L is on a higher shelf than H.
  If L is on a higher shelf than H, then that means H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on either the top or middle shelf.

  F and M are on the same shelf, but we don't know which shelf that is yet.
  From previous statements, we know that K is on a higher shelf than F, which means F cannot be on the bottom shelf and must be on the middle or top shelf with M.
  Since more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, M cannot be on the top shelf with F. 
  Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf together with I. This leaves G and H to be on the bottom shelf together.
  If L is on a higher shelf than H, then G, which is on the same shelf as H, must also be on the top.

  Since Robertson has four parking spaces to choose from (i.e., spaces #1, #2, #3, or #4), there will be multiple valid orders of assignment that satisfy all the rules and restrictions provided. Along with that, we know the ranking preference of only Young and Togowa, but no others.
  If we assign parking spaces to any two employees such that we directly know the relative order of the two employees (e.g., ""Young has parking space #2 and Togowa has parking space #1""), then we can use the rule that ""Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa"" to infer the relative order of these two employees with respect to the other employees.
  Therefore, we need to pick a parking space assigned to an employee for which the relative order with respect to others can be inferred.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then the relative order with respect to all other employees can be inferred, as we know Robertson will have a higher-numbered parking space than Young.

      In this case, Udall must work in Zone 3 (from the information that Tiao and Udall would not work in the same zone). Then we have only one person left for Zone 1 (either Parra or Kim, from the information given), and we have three people left for Zone 3. However, we know that there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so this case is impossible.
    - Case 2: Tiao works in Zone 3.
      In this case, Udall must work in Zone 2 (from the information that Tiao and Udall would not work in the same zone). Then we can assign Kim and Mahr to either Zone 1 or Zone 3, and we have Parra, Quinn, and Stuckey left for the other zone. Since we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, it follows that Kim and Mahr must work in the same zone. Therefore, the only possible combination for Zone 3 is Kim, Tiao, and Mahr. This rules out options A, C, and E.
    - Case 3: Udall works in Zone 3.
      Similar to Case 1, this case is impossible since it results in more people working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.

  Notice that if the first batch of oatmeal cookies were made on Monday in the first row, then according to the second condition, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday in the second row. If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, in the last row, there will be no other day for the first batch of peanut butter cookies but Wednesday. 
  Therefore, the table should look like this:

  The first batch of one kind made on Thursday would mean that the second batch of sugar cookies would be made on Monday. 
  Thus, the batch made on the same day would be the third batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies.
  Because oatmeal 2 and peanut butter 1 are made on the same day, then days 2 and 3 are ruled out.
  Therefore, oatmeal 3 and peanut butter 2 must both be made on Wednesday. 
  The third batch of sugar cookies must then be made on Thursday. 
  Using these constraints, we can evaluate the choices.
  A. It is always true that at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. This is not the false statement.
  B. If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first and third batches of oatmeal cookies would be made on other days leaving Wednesday with one batch of oatmeal and one batch of peanut butter cookies, so it is not necessarily true that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C. We already know that this statement is not necessarily true because it is stated in the conditions that ""at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday."" Therefore, this is not the false statement.
  D. If the first and second batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Tuesday, then the two batches of peanut butter cookies would be made on Monday and Wednesday, and the batches of sugar cookies would be made on Thursday and Friday.

  E.

- From the last three slots, Uneasy has to fill one of them, leaving other two for Zircon and Xpert. 
- Since Vegemite is in slot 3, only slots 1 and 2 are available for Yardsign. Therefore it's impossible to say anything about Wellspring and Yardsign.

In option A, there are only two books, so it is not possible to meet the condition that the number of books on the bottom shelf is more than the top shelf.
In option B, H is on the bottom shelf while K is on the top shelf, so it violates the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
Option C also violates the same condition because K is on the same shelf as G and H.
Option E violates the condition that F is on the same shelf as M because M is not on the bottom shelf.
Therefore, the answer is D because in this option we have F and M on the same shelf, and O can be on the top shelf, while G is on the middle shelf. Moreover, the condition that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf is met because there are four books on the bottom shelf (F, G, M, O) while only three books are on the top shelf.

    1. Nina gives a report on Monday, George gives a report on Tuesday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday. In this scenario, Helen could potentially give a report on Wednesday. --> This satisfies answer choice A.
    2. Nina gives a report on Tuesday, George gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday. In this scenario, no one would give a report on Monday afternoon. --> This does not satisfy any of the answer choices.
    3. George gives a report on Monday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Tuesday. In this scenario, Nina's report is given on Wednesday, which means Helen and Irving would not have to give reports on consecutive days. --> This satisfies answer choice E.

- George already gives a report on Tuesday, therefore Monday and Wednesday are left for the other 5 students.
- If Nina presents on Monday, this means Helen and Irving have to present on Tuesday which means it leaves only Robert and Olivia for Wednesday morning, violating the stated conditions, so Nina cannot present it on Monday.

- A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected
  - If Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be selected which violates the second condition.

To solve the problem, we need to examine each choice and see if that choice leads to only one possible combination for the three workers selected to be project members and the project leader. 

  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then there are five workers to choose from. Therefore, this choice does not completely determine the project members and leader.

  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then there are five workers to choose from. Therefore, this choice does not completely determine the project members and leader.

  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are five workers to choose from. Therefore, this choice does not completely determine the project members and leader.

  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are three workers left to choose from (Smith, Taylor, and Xue). Since Wells cannot be a project member if Ruiz is not a project member, and three project members must be selected, it follows that Ruiz must be a project member. Since Ruiz is a project member, he or she must be the project leader. Therefore, the only possible combination of workers and leader is Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor. This choice completely determines the project members and leader.

  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then there are four workers left to choose from (Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue). Since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is a project member, and three project members must be selected, it follows that Wells cannot be a project member. Since neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member if they are not the project leader, it follows that either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, the two possible combinations of workers and leaders are:
  1) Quinn, Ruiz, and Smith with Ruiz as the leader

  We need to determine which condition that the project members are selected will make the selection of the project complete.
  
  In the constraint, it is stated that Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project. Therefore, if either Quinn or Ruiz is selected, the other one will also be selected as a project leader. That leaves only one spot for another project member.
  
  If Smith is selected as a project member, Taylor must also be selected. That makes two project members and one project leader assigned.
  
  If Wells is selected as a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. That means only one spot is available for another project member.
  
  Based on the constraints, none of them can be a project member with Xue. 
  
  Thus, if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected as a project member, the selection for the project is complete. Because if either of them gets selected, it will leave only one spot for another project member according to the given constraints which may make the selection incomplete.

Constraint 2: If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.

Since there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, we cannot have anyone else in Zone 2, as otherwise, there would be more people in Zone 2 than in Zone 3.

  Since Stuckey and Mahr are in the same zone, there cannot be enough space in Zone 1 (for Tiao or Parra) or in Zone 3 (for Parra or Quinn). Therefore, the only possible location for Mahr is Zone 2.
  
  Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, as either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2. Since Udall cannot work in Zone 2, Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that Parra must work in Zone 1 and Kim must work in Zone 2.
  
  Therefore, with Mahr and Stuckey working in the same sales zone, Parra must work in Zone 1.

  - One of the restaurants must be at the other end.
  - The two restaurants must have at least two businesses between them.

  Observations:
  - Since the pharmacy has a constraint to be at one of the ends, and one of the restaurants at the other, either the optometrist or veterinarian should be located at the middle position, i.e., position 4.
  - The pharmacy can only be at space 1 or 7.
  - Since the two restaurants should have at least two businesses between them, there are only two possible locations for the first restaurant, either space 2 or 3, and three possible locations for the second restaurant, either space 6 or 5, or combination of spaces 5, 6 or 6, 7.
  - Since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, there are two possible locations for the toy store, either space 2 or 6.
  - The shoe store cannot be at positions 3 or 5 since they are the only possible positions for the second restaurant and should have at least two businesses between them. Therefore, the shoe store should be at position 4.
  Let's try to fill the spaces based on the constraints, starting with choice A:
  - Start with the pharmacy, which should be at one of the ends. Choices A and B place the pharmacy at space 1, which means the optometrist or veterinarian has to be in position 4. However, the shoe store should be in position 4. Choices C, D, and E place the pharmacy at space 7, which leaves only the option of the optometrist or veterinarian at position 4.
  - Next, the two restaurants: one of them must be the last space, so there are two possible locations for the first restaurant, either the second or third space, with the other restaurant at position 5 and 6, respectively, or as a combination of spaces 5,6, or 6,7. Therefore, choice C fits, and the toy store should be at space 2.

  Choice C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant

  We are given seven clues to be mentioned exactly once each in seven chapters.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it has to be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, the possible positions of T and W are (2, 5), (2, 6), (2, 7), (3, 6), and (3, 7).
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X should be mentioned in either chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then either R or Z must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 2, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, because T must have exactly two chapters separating it from W. Therefore, T can only be mentioned in chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then the position of T and W is (2, 5), which fits the conditions.

  If both photographs in one of the sections is by Gagnon, then none of the photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.
  The only available photographer for photographs in the Sports section is Fuentes.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  No Gagnon's photograph can be in the Sports section.
  Thus, none of the photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.
  This implies that there is only one photograph in each of the sections where Gagnon's photograph is not included.
  Since there are two photographs in each section, this implies that both should have been taken by one of the other two available photographers.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, that means there will be no photograph in the Metro section by either Hue or Fuentes, which violates the rule where at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Choice A is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. But it's impossible as there cannot be any Gagnon's photograph in the Sports section.
  Choice B is also not possible.
  On the other hand, if both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, that means one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue which is possible.
  Similarly, if one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the rule of no Gagnon's photograph in the Sports section and the no Hue's photograph in the Metro section make it possible.

  - Both photographs in the Metro section can't be by Fuentes as then Fuentes would have none of his pictures in the Lifestyle section.
  - One photograph in the Metro section can't be by Gagnon because the question states that exactly two photographs are to appear in each of the three sections.

  D: If lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then harmonica must have been auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.

- The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
- The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

On June 1st, the auction cannot be for the Sundial. So, the Sundial has to be auctioned on a date after June 1st.
From the second condition, if harmonica has an earlier auction date than the lamp, the mirror will also have an earlier auction date than the lamp. That means, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, which eliminates Choices B and E.
From the third condition, the vase is auctioned on a date after the auction date of the Sundial. Also, the sundial was not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, which eliminates Choice C.

Now, let's consider the fourth and fifth choices:
- D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
- A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.

If we assume that the Harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the Harmonica is the first auction item and the Table is the last one. That means the Mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, which satisfies Choice A, and the Lamp will be auctioned on June 3rd, which satisfies Choice D.
Therefore, the answer is either A or D, but we need to check the other possibility to ensure that it is not valid. 
If the auction of the Harmonica is not on June 1st, then the Sundial has to be auctioned on June 1st as the Sundial can't be auctioned after the vase. If the Sundial is auctioned on June 1st, that means Harmonica has to be auctioned on June 2nd because of the fourth condition. In this case, the Table will be auctioned on June 5th and the Lamp on June 6th. This doesn't satisfy either choice in the given question.
Therefore, the answer is A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.

  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so we can eliminate June 1st for the sundial.
  If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the lamp then the mirror must also be auctioned earlier than the lamp. This can help us deduce a number of possibilities.

  Let's examine some possible scenarios:
  Option 1: Table on June 1st.
    The sundial cannot be on June 1st, so it must be on June 2nd or 3rd.
    The earliest the harmonica can be auctioned is June 3rd. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, so it can only be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the lamp, mirror, and vase must be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, and 6th. 
    From the second condition, we have two remaining possibilities for these three antiques: either the lamp and the mirror are auctioned on June 4th and 5th and the vase on June 6th, or the mirror is auctioned on June 4th, the lamp on June 5th, and the vase on June 6th.
    Neither of these scenarios matches any of the answer choices.

  Option 2: Table on June 2nd to June 6th.
    The sundial can be auctioned on June 1st, but not on June 2nd. 
    The earliest the harmonica can be auctioned is June 2nd. If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then neither the harmonica nor the vase can be auctioned on June 1st, so the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd. From the second condition, the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st. The harmonica, lamp, and sundial must then be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, and 6th in some order.
    This means the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, and the vase is auctioned on June 6th.

  We can use the given conditions to check the feasibility of all options:
  - Option A: If the Mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the Harmonica must also be auctioned by then. But, if the Harmonica is auctioned before the Lamp, then the Mirror should be auctioned on a date before the Lamp. This contradicts the given condition that Mirror is not auctioned before the Lamp. Therefore, Option A is not possible.
  - Option B: If the Lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the Harmonica must also be auctioned by then. This satisfies the given conditions, as the Mirror can be auctioned earlier than the Lamp. Therefore, Option B is possible.
  - Option C: If the Vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the Sundial and Mirror should be auctioned on earlier dates. But, Sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st and Mirror cannot be auctioned before the Lamp, which is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, Option C is not possible.
  - Option D: If the Lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the Sundial must be auctioned earlier than that. Additionally, the Harmonica cannot be auctioned after the Lamp, and the Mirror must be auctioned earlier than the Lamp if the Harmonica is auctioned before the Lamp. This does not result in a feasible solution. Therefore, Option D is not possible.
  - Option E: If the Mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the Lamp must be auctioned on June 6th. But, the Sundial cannot be auctioned after the Vase, and the Vase must be auctioned after the Mirror if the Mirror is auctioned on June 5th. Therefore, Option E is not possible.

  Tao was recruited second.
  Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Peters was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time. Therefore, the order of the others depends on their relation with Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White.
  Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth, the order could be Peters-Quinn-?-?-Rovero-?-? or Quinn-Peters-?-?-Rovero-?-?
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, they can be in order: ...-Villas-White-...
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Based on the above:
    If Quinn was recruited third, the order could be Peters-Quinn-Tao-?-Rovero-Villas-White or Quinn-Peters-Tao-?-Rovero-Villas-White.
    If Rovero was recruited fifth, the order could be Peters-Quinn-Rovero-?-Tao-Villas-White.

    Quinn was recruited before Rovero (so Quinn had to be first, followed by Peters and Tao or vice versa, and then with Rovero following either Peters or Tao)
    Villas was immediately before White
    and we also know that Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao (so there are at least two people between Tao and Stanton)
  So, if Tao was recruited second, Peters was the first, and his recruits could be Quinn and Rovero in one order and Rovero and Quinn in the other order.
  If Quinn is recruited third, then his recruit must be Villas followed by White, but we know that Villas was recruited before White and therefore it is impossible for Quinn to be in the third position.
  If Rovero is recruited fifth, we know that Quinn and Peters must be the first two, Tao in third, Villas, and White, so Stanton would be last which is impossible.
  If Stanton were sixth, then Peters and Quinn would be first two, Tao in third, then Rovero, and then Villas, so White would be last which is also impossible.
  If Villas were sixth, then Peters and Quinn would be first two, Tao in third, Rovero in fourth, and Stanton in fifth, which is possible.
  If White were third, then Quinn and Peters would be the first two, Tao in second, and with no one else to recruit, Villas, Rovero and stand would come in the next three positions, which is possible.

  If Y is fourth, then S must be either first, second or third.
  If S is first, then Q is third and the order is S, R, Q. Therefore, G cannot be edited fourth. This happens consecutively with H and J; hence our assumption is invalid.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, so the order is R, S, Q. Then, G and H must be first and fourth, in some order. J cannot be edited third as it will violate the condition that J must be earlier than G. S cannot go fourth as it is not allowed to come after Y. Therefore, J cannot be edited first which will violate the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q is first. The order may be Q, R, S, Y, G, H, J.
    - The first three, Q, R, and S, are in an order that satisfies all the rules.
    - Y comes immediately after S, satisfying both 'S must be earlier than Y'.
    - G and H can be edited fifth and sixth.

  If Y is fourth, it is impossible for Q or S to be first or second since they both have to be later than Y.

  If Y is fourth and Q is third, then the second article has to be an article that does not cover nutrition.
  J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be the first article.
  That leaves the finance articles H and G as the possible choices for the second article. 
  G must be earlier than R, so R cannot be the second article either.
  That leaves H as the only possible second article.
  Therefore, the order of the first four articles is H, S, Q, Y.
  After that, we have to place the remaining articles G, J, and R, and we know that G must be earlier than R and J must be earlier than G.
  
  There are only two possible orders for the remaining three articles, which are:
  H, S, Q, Y, J, G, R
  or
  H, S, Q, Y, G, J, R

  - The western begins some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the western must be shown before the horror film.

Analyzing each option:
  Option A: The sci-fi film, the horror film. This can be an accurate list since the western is shown before the horror film, and it cannot be the mystery that is shown with the horror film as they are shown on different screens. Hence, option A is possible.
  Option B: The sci-fi film, the mystery. This can be an accurate list since the western is shown before the horror film, and it cannot be the horror film that is shown with the mystery as they are shown on different screens. So, option B is possible.
  Option C: The western, the horror film. This can be an accurate list since the western must be on screen 1 or 2, while the horror film must be on screen 1 or 2 at 9 PM.

  - Option A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and neither Kim nor Stuckey was mentioned as one of the two options. Hence, option A must be false.
  - Option B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible since both are not mentioned to work in a specific zone. Hence, option B may be true or false.
  - Option C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible since there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Hence, option C may be true or false.
  - Option D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible since there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and neither Mahr nor Udall was mentioned as one of the representatives that are already assigned to a specific zone. Hence, option D may be true or false.
  - Option E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible since only one of Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and Stuckey and Udall are assigned to the same zone which cannot be Zone 1. Hence, option E must be false.

  We need to review the given conditions to establish which answer is false.
  Parra or Tiao work in Zone 1 (but not both).
  Tiao or Udall work in Zone 2 (but not both).
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  More sales representatives are in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  We must test each answer choice against these conditions, and if we find one that satisfies it, then that answer is false.
  Answer choice A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. According to the given conditions, neither Kim nor Stuckey must work in Zone 1. This answer could be true. Eliminate A.
  Answer choice B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. There must be more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this answer is true, and can't be false. Eliminate B.
  Answer choice C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This answer choice implies at least 3 reps work in Zone 3. But it contradicts the fact that there are more reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Thus, answer choice C must be false.
  Answer choice D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This answer implies at least 3 reps work in Zone 2, and so Zone 2 can't have 0 or 1 reps. This answer can't be false because there are more sales reps in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Eliminate D.
  Answer choice E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. Parra can't work in Zone 1 and Stuckey can't work in Zone 1 because neither Parra nor Quinn can be in Zone 1, and neither Stuckey nor Udall can be in Zone 1. Eliminate E.

  From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Thus, Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2 since Stuckey has been assigned to work in the same sales zone as either Udall or Parra, who are already assigned to Zone 2 and Zone 1 respectively. Therefore, more of the sales representatives should work in Zone 3 compared to Zone 2. This eliminates Choices (A), (B), and (E). Examining the remaining choices, it is possible that Mahr could work in Zone 3 since it is not clear which sales zone Mahr is assigned to based on the given conditions. Thus, Choice (C) may be true.

  The Himalayan is not featured on Day 1 and is featured on exactly three days, after eliminating Day 1, they could be featured on Day 3 through Day 6 only.
  Rottweilers are not featured on Day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, which means Rottweilers could be featured on Day 2, or Day 7 but not both since they cannot feature on the same day as Himalayans.
  Hence we can pair Manx and Newfoundland, pair Himalayan and Rottweiler with Siamese and one other breed, respectively.

From given conditions, we can infer that Greyhounds are only on day 1, which implies that neither Greyhounds nor Rottweilers can be featured on day 7. Also, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, but they are on exactly three days.

A. If any breed is featured on 3 days, then exactly one breed is featured only twice, and one breed is featured four times. However, it is known that Himalayans are featured exactly on three days.

B. Himalayans can't be there on day one, but if they are there, then they must be there for exactly three days. Therefore, Himalayans can't always be with Greyhounds.

C. No because Greyhounds are only on day 1, and Himalayans cannot be on day 1.

D. This option seems possible because if Rottweilers cannot feature on any day that features Himalayans, it can mean that Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

E. This option is possible because Rottweilers are not on any day that features Himalayans, so it seems that Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, (except for day 1).

  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. 
     There are only three breeds of each animal, which means only three different breeds of each animal can appear for three days. So, this choice is not possible.
  
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. 
     Himalayans are featured on exactly three days which means there are at least three days of the week that do not feature Himalayans. Therefore, there are at least three days when Greyhounds cannot be featured. So, this choice is not possible.

  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. 
     This choice cannot be true as there are exactly three days with Himalayans and less than three days with Greyhounds, i.e. only 1 day with Greyhounds, day 1.

  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. 
     Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
     There should be three days for Himalayans and three days for the breeds which are not Rottweilers for this condition to be true (as there are a total of 6 days with breeds other than Rottweilers). Therefore, Himalayans should be featured on only three days. As Rottweilers are not featured on the same three days that Himalayans are, this choice can be true.
  
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. 
     Himalayans are featured on exactly three days which mean less than four days of the week have Himalayans. For the rest of the days, three breeds are featured, one of which is not Himalayans. So this choice cannot be true.

    - Case 1: W=1 and T=2
        From the statement that none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, we have the following possibilities. 
        i) Solide's voicemail target (V) is 2 days, and Image's V and T's voicemail targets both are 1 day. This satisfies Condition 2. However, for Condition 1 to hold for Image, Image's website target must also be 1 day which does not satisfy option A.
        ii) Solide's V is 1 day, and Image's V and T's voicemail targets both are 1 day. This again satisfies Condition 2. Since this option includes Image's website target as 1 day, this satisfies option A. 
      Thus, one solution is W=1, T=2, Solide's V=1, Truvest's V=2, Image's V=1, and Image's W=1. 
      This satisfies the given conditions and the options A, B, C, and D.
      However, it violates the statement that ""each of the following must be true EXCEPT"".

        i) Image's V and Image's website target both are 1 day, Solide's V and Solide's website target both are 2 days, and Truvest's V and Truvest's website target both are 3 days. This option does not satisfy Condition 2 since Solide's website target is not shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, this option is eliminated.

  2- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  3- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, then Solide and Truvest voicemail targets can only be of 1 day or 2 days.
  Since Image's voicemail target is required to be shorter than other clients, that makes Image's voicemail target be of 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, and since we know Truvest's voicemail target is 1 day or 2 days, this makes Truvest's website target 2 days because there can not be two same-day targets, and Solide's website target can be 2 or 3 days because we only know Truvest's website target is set to 2 days.
  Therefore, the web and voicemail targets for each client are:
  Image: Website = 1 day, Voicemail = 1 day
  Solide: Website = 2 or 3 days, Voicemail = 1 or 2 days
  Truvest: Website = 2 days, Voicemail = 1 or 2 days

  We need to determine which option is not necessarily true based on the given conditions.
  We know that if none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  Option A is possible since it says, ""Image's website target is 1 day,"" and this is allowed by the conditions given.
  Option B is also possible since ""Solide's website target is 2 days,"" which is allowed as long as Truvest's website target is longer.
  Option C is possible since ""Solide's voicemail target is 2 days,"" which complies with the given conditions.
  Option D is also possible since ""Truvest's website target is 2 days,"" which is allowed as long as Solide's website target is shorter.
  Option E may not be true in all cases because if Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target could be 3 days since none of the clients can have a website target longer than their voicemail target.

  According to the conditions, Solide's website target should be shorter than Truvest’s website target. Thus, Truvest’s website target must be either 1 day or 2 days. 
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Thus, Image's voicemail target should be 1 day and the voicemail targets for Solide and Truvest should be 2 days.

One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. 
From the conditions, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. So, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes or Hue and this photographer must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
If we assume that Fuentes has a photograph in the Metro section, then he must have one more photograph either in Metro or Lifestyle section. But both sections already have one of Fuentes' photograph, so it means the third photograph of Fuentes must be in the Sports section. This means Hue also has only one photograph left which must be in Sports. Therefore, Gagnon will have no photograph left to place in Sports. This contradicts the condition for Gagnon which states that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Hence, our assumption is incorrect.

The correct assumption is that Hue has a photograph in the Metro section, then it means Fuentes have to have both remaining in Metro and Sports section. This means none of their photographs can be in the Lifestyle section. Gagnon must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section but neither of them can be in Metro or Sports section. And Gagnon must have one photograph in the Sports section.

  Since there are only three photographs left, let's evaluate each answer choice to see if it makes sense:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes - Not possible because at least one photograph in the Metro section must be from a different photographer who also took a photo in the Lifestyle section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon - Not possible because no Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section according to the question.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro is by Hue - Possible, because either Hue or Fuentes must have a photograph in the Metro section, which means Gagnon has none or one photograph in the Metro section.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue - Not possible because Hue must have the same number of photographs as Fuentes in the Sports section, but Fuentes already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.

We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is taken by Fuentes and one by Hue.
If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Therefore, we deduce the following:
- The other Fuentes photograph must be in the Sports section.
- The other Hue photograph must be in the Lifestyle section.
- Because none of Gagnon's photos can be in the Sports section and only two photographs per section are allowed, Gagnon is not represented in the Sports section.
- Because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is equal to the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and both photographers have only one photo in the Lifestyle section, then each of these photographers has exactly one photo in the Sports section.
- Therefore, the photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon.

  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Tiffany, Onyx, and Yoshio must be assigned to 1921, 1923, 1924, and 1921 or 1923, 1924, 1921, and 1923 respectively.
  Therefore, the situation in which Mollie is assigned to 1922 is the most restrictive one. 
  Tiffany must also be assigned to the project, so Ryan must be assigned to the project as well as Yoshio.
  Then, since Ryan must be assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, that is, 1923.
  The remaining year, 1924, must be assigned to Louis.
  The situation in which Mollie is assigned 1922 matches the requirements above.

  If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  The problem does not say anything about any other student specifically being assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, we cannot immediately exclude any other student except Mollie of being assigned to 1922.
  Let's go through each of the options:
    A: Louis is assigned to 1924. This tells us nothing about whether Mollie must be assigned to 1922 or not.
    B: Onyx is assigned to 1921. If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then according to the condition, Ryan must be assigned to 1922. And if Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to 1922 which is 1921. Therefore, this statement is not compatible with Mollie being assigned to 1921. Thus, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
    C: Onyx is assigned to 1924. This tells us nothing about whether Mollie must be assigned to 1922 or not.
    D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then according to the condition, Ryan must be assigned to the project. But if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's which would be 1923. Thus, this statement is not compatible with assigning Mollie to 1922. 
    E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921. This tells us nothing about whether Mollie must be assigned to 1922 or not.

  So, if the statement ""Mollie must be assigned to 1922"" is true, then Mollie is assigned to 1922.
  The question asks us which of the following statements can guarantee that Mollie is assigned to 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then either Ryan or Onyx must be assigned to 1922.

  Therefore, if Mollie must be assigned to 1922, then neither Onyx nor Ryan can be assigned to 1921.
  That means Yoshio must be assigned to 1921, and Onyx must be assigned to 1924.

  If Mollie is assigned, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie must be assigned to 1922, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1921 since there is only one project for each year.
  So, we can tentatively assign Mollie to 1922 and Yoshio to 1921.
  Since Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, let us assume Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Ryan is assigned to the project since Tiffany can only be assigned to the same project with Ryan.
  Now we know the assignments for 1921, 1922, and 1923. By the last condition, Onyx must be assigned to the project immediately before Ryan's project. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921.

  Let's assume:
    X- Number of sales representatives in Zone 1
    Y- Number of sales representatives in Zone 2
    Z- Number of sales representatives in Zone 3
  Since X is greater than Z, it must be =< 3. Since Y cannot be 0 (it would imply that Udall + Tiao = 0, contradiction with rule 2), it must be 1.
  If 1 representative is in Zone 2, either Tiao or Udall must occupy it, then the other is in Zone 3 by rule 2.

If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than Zone 2, then Zone 1 has the fewest sales representatives working there.
Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, but both cannot work in Zone 1 at the same time. Parra cannot work in Zone 3 since he works in the same sales zone as Quinn and more representatives work in Zone 3, so Parra must work in Zone 1. 
Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall works in the same zone as Stuckey which is either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Since there are more representatives working in Zone 3 and Udall works in the same zone as Stuckey, then he must work in Zone 3.
Kim and Mahr have not yet been placed.
If more representatives work in Zone 3 than Zone 2, only one of Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3.
In any case, more representatives cannot work in Zone 1 than Zone 3, hence it cannot be that Parra works in Zone 3, so option C is not correct. 
The possible candidate sales representatives to work in Zone 2 are Mahr and Tiao. Of the two candidates, only Tiao would work in Zone 2 since Udall already works in that zone.
Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1, Parra works in Zone 1, Kim works in Zone 3, Mahr works in Zone 2, Quinn and Parra are together hence Quinn works in Zone 1, and Udall and Stuckey are together thus Udall works in Zone 3

  Thus, from the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao and their associates must be working in Zone 1. And we know that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, thus, Tiao cannot be working in Zone 2, and Udall must be working in Zone 2 with Stuckey.

  Either Tiao or Udall but not both works in Zone 2, and if more representatives are in Zone 3, Tiao must work with at least two representatives so Udall would be in the other zone with the fewer number of representatives.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so both of them must be in Zone 2 if Udall is in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so both of them must be in Zone 1 if Parra is also in Zone 1.

  Let's first analyze the given conditions:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Suppose that there are no sales representatives in Zone 3. Then, the three sales zones will respectively have either one or two sales representatives. Since there are exactly seven sales representatives, this assumption leaves us with two possible scenarios:
  - Scenario 1: Zones 1 and 2 have two sales representatives, while Zone 3 has one.
  - Scenario 2: One of the sales zones (Zone 1 or Zone 2) has two sales representatives, while the other two zones have one sales representative each.
  
  Given that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Scenario 1 cannot occur. Therefore, there are two sales representatives in either Zone 1 or Zone 2 and one sales representative in Zone 3.
  
  Let's examine the answer choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2. It cannot be true that Kim works in Zone 2 because Zone 2 can have at most two representatives, and we need to put Tiao or Udall in Zone 2. Therefore, A is false.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2. It cannot be true that Mahr works in Zone 2 because Zone 2 can have at most two representatives, and we need to put Tiao or Udall in Zone 2. Therefore, B is false.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3. If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there is only one sales representative in Zone 3. Thus, it is possible for Parra to work in Zone 3 while the other two representatives are in either Zone 1 or 2 to satisfy the conditions given. So, C could be true.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot be in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra has to be with Quinn in Zone 2. Stuckey and Udall are left to work in Zone 3. However, with Tiao being in Zone 1, there would be two sales representatives in Zone 1, and that would contradict the given condition since we are counting two sales representatives in Zone 3 and one sales representative in Zone 1. Therefore, D is false.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3. If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey works in Zone 3 as well. Also, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 while the other works in Zone 2 with Quinn. Thus, only one of the other representatives can be in Zone 2 beside Quinn and the other goes to Zone 1. Therefore, we have two sales representatives in Zone 1 and two sales representatives in Zone 3. This scenario satisfies all the given conditions, and it is consistent with having more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E could be true.

If we know that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3 ⇒ we can deduce that: no more than one sales representative can work in Zone 2, otherwise, there would have to be more sales representatives in Zone 2 than Zone 3.
From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Tiao are the only two sales reps who could work in Zone 1. So if more sales reps work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. 
If Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they can not be in different zones 2 and 3 because in this case, there would be no fewer representatives in the third zone than in the second zone, which is not possible.
Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must therefore each work in different zones, so that each zone has no more than two representatives. There are two ways to distribute Kim, Mahr, and Quinn among the different zones that work with the previous arrangements: (1) Kim works in Zone 1, Mahr works in Zone 3, and Quinn works in Zone 3, or (2) Kim works in Zone 3, Mahr works in Zone 1, and Quinn works in Zone 1. (Note: it's impossible to satisfy all the conditions if all three work in the same zone.) Since it is possible for more sales reps to work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Option 2 is the solution.

  If neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, and we know that exactly two students will give reports each day, then Olivia and Robert will give morning reports on two different days. Therefore, none of the other students can give a morning report on those days.

  Now, let's consider each option:
    A: Helen, George, and Nina => Neither of Olivia or Robert can give a report on Monday because they cannot give afternoon reports. There is a problem with George's report as well because no one else can give a report on Tuesday except for Olivia and Robert. Therefore, this option is not possible.

On Tuesday, George and Irving have to give reports, and on Wednesday, Helen and Irving. Therefore, C is the correct option.
    D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving => This is not possible because both Olivia and Robert have a restriction against afternoon reports.

  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there are only 6 students left who might give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Tuesday is the only day that George might give his report, but there might be two morning reports on Tuesday, since it is not stated that George will not give his report in the morning.
  Olivia and Robert can only give morning reports.
  If Nina gives her report, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Helen cannot give her report on Wednesday since there must be a morning report on that day.
  If Nina's report is given on Monday, then Irving and Helen must give reports on Tuesday, but Robert and Olivia cannot.
  Thus, there are only two possible schedules of reports:
    Monday: Nina and Robert
    Tuesday: George and Helen
    Wednesday: Irving and Olivia

    Monday: Robert and Nina

  We also know that George's speech will be on Tuesday. This means that George will not give a speech on Monday or Wednesday. Moreover, two speeches will be held on Tuesday, meaning that there will be only one speech each on Monday and Wednesday.
  We are also told that Olivia and Robert cannot give their reports in the afternoon. Therefore, their speeches must be in the morning on Monday and Wednesday.
  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day both Helen and Irving must give reports unless her report is given on Wednesday.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (which must be Tuesday), both Helen and Irving must give reports.
  However, if Nina's report is on Wednesday, then either Helen or Irving can give one of Tuesday's reports, and the other can give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, there are two possible ways to arrange the report-giving schedule: (1) Nina gives a report on Monday, and the other Monday report is given by Helen or Irving. The morning reports on Tuesday and Wednesday are given by George, Robert, Olivia, and one of Helen or Irving. (2) Nina gives a report on Wednesday. The morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are given by Helen, Irving, Robert, and George, respectively.

If Nina gives a report, then on the following day (Wednesday) Helen and Irving must both give reports. However, if Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then we only know that Helen and Irving give a report on one of Monday and Tuesday. Therefore:
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday (because of the second condition). This means the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday will be given by Nina, George, and Olivia, respectively.
- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then there are no restrictions on who gives reports on Monday. However, Helen and Irving still need to give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Robert, George, and Nina, respectively.
- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give their reports on Monday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by Olivia, George, and Helen, respectively.
In all cases, Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they cannot be among the people giving morning reports. We are asked to find a combination of three people who could give morning reports on three consecutive days, so we can eliminate A and C because they both have Nina and Helen giving morning reports on consecutive days, which is not allowed.

  Since there are eight students, it means that two of them are not going to present, this means the possible presenters are George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert - 2 students.
  It is given that George can present only on Tuesday. This means that he cannot present on Monday and Wednesday. 
  On Wednesday, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. So they will give the morning report. Also, once Nina presents, the next day Helen and Irving must both present unless Nina's report is on Wednesday. This means if Nina is presenting on Wednesday then there will be no presentation on Thursday. 
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, there will be only six presenters out of the eight options.
  So, there are two students who will not present, which means the students who will present will be Nina, Helen, Irving, Olivia, Robert, and George.
  Using the constraints that are given, we can determine which student will present when.
  Since Kyle and Lenore cannot present, the possible choices for the morning report on Monday is Nina, Olivia, Robert, George, and Helen. However, because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they will give a morning report on Monday. So the morning report on Monday will be given by Helen and Irving or vice versa. Nina will present on Wednesday. So, the morning report on Wednesday must exclude Nina. The only feasible way to do this is through the combination of Robert, George, and Helen.

  The rule gives that George can only present on Tuesday. Therefore, we place George on Tuesday morning. 
  Also, Olivia and Robert cannot present in the afternoon, then they can only present in the morning. 
  If Nina presents, then the next day Helen and Irving must present. If Nina presents on Wednesday, then neither Helen nor Irving can present on Wednesday. Thus, Nina cannot present on Wednesday. 
  Hence, Nina can present any day in the morning session. 
  As there is no restriction on Monday, its speakers can be any. So we can select the answer that has neither Helen nor Irving presenting on Monday. 
  Option A has Helen speaking on Monday but Nina can speak on Monday only if Nina doesn't speak on Wednesday but then Helen and Irving must speak on Wednesday as well.
  In Option B, Helen and Irving cannot speak on Monday but this eliminates Robert or Irving as potential morning speakers. 
  In Option C, Nina can speak any day, Helen speaks on Wednesday and Olivia speaks only in the morning.
  In Option D, Irving and Robert cannot speak in the afternoon.

  F is on the same shelf as M, so they must be together on one of the shelves.
  K is placed higher than F, so K is not on the bottom shelf, and F and M are not on the top shelf.

  Option E gives us information about the 5th position. However, we cannot determine the order of the articles from this information.

- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

We can break down each choice by inserting it into the order and determining if it breaks any of the conditions:

A: H is fourth.
- This leaves no place for J and G as they must be in that order.
- This also means that Q must be third, which leaves no place for S.

B: H is sixth.
- If H is sixth, R must be seventh, which satisfies the last condition.
- If Q is third, then S must be first (because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third).
- Based on this, we can determine that G is second, J is first and the three nutrition articles have been arranged.
- This leaves the wildlife article to be edited as fifth.
- Therefore, this arrangement satisfies all given conditions.
- The order is fully determined with H in sixth.

C: R is fourth.
- This leaves no place for G and J as they must be in the previous articles.
- This also means that S must be earlier than Q, which breaks one of the conditions.
- Therefore, this arrangement is impossible.

D: R is seventh.
- This leaves no place for G and J as they must be earlier in the order.
- This also means that Q must be third, which leaves no place for S.

 - S must be earlier than Y
 - J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R.
 
If H is 4th in the order, then articles covering nutrition cannot be consecutive, neither can the articles covering finance be consecutive. More so, S cannot be first and Y cannot be second. However, the position of Q, R and Y has not been determined.
If H is 6th in the order, then only two articles remain for H after the nutrition and finance topics have been exhausted. Again, the position of Q, R, and Y is not determined.
If R is fourth in the order, this means J, G, and H must all appear before R. Since J must be earlier than G, the order is J, G, H, R, then Q, S, and Y follow. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
If R is seventh in the order, there is not enough information to know the location of R, J, G, Q, and S.

  We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, the first article edited cannot be G, H, J, Q, R, or S, because there is no other article to pair with them that cover a different topic.
  
  If S is earlier than Q, then Q must be the third article. Therefore, this leaves only one option for the second article: an article on finance. The next available article would be R by the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Hence, the order must be S-Q-R. The next two articles must be articles on finance, with J coming before the combination of G and H. Finally, we are left with the article on wildlife.

  If the table is auctioned after the dates for both the mirror and the vase, that must be on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, that means that the harmonica and the vase (which have earlier dates) should be already auctioned.
  From the conditions mentioned in the context, we know that the vase has a later date than the sundial and the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, the sundial must have been auctioned either on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, then the vase must have been auctioned on June 3rd and the harmonica on June 4th. Therefore, option A can't be true.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the vase must have been auctioned on June 4th and the harmonica on June 3rd. Therefore, option A can be true.
  Since the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

  Let's consider the remaining options:
  Option C: If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then it must have been auctioned on June 1st because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.

  We know there are six antiques to be auctioned, and each item is auctioned exactly once per day from June 1st through June 6th. Let's start by constructing a schedule:
  
  June 1st: 
    Item auctioned: (not the sundial)
  June 2nd: 
    Item auctioned:
  June 3rd: 
    Item auctioned:
  June 4th: 
    Item auctioned:
  June 5th: 
    Item auctioned:
  June 6th: 
    Item auctioned:

  From the conditions, we know:
    - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st (implying it must be auctioned on June 2nd - June 6th inclusive)
    - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp (implying if either the harmonica or the lamp appears in the first three days, then both the mirror and the vase must also appear in the first three days).
    - The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase (implying the table cannot be auctioned on June 3rd).
    - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.

  We can then organize the conditions into an ordered list:
    1. The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    2. The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
    3. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
    4. The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.

  From the question, we are given that the table is auctioned after the mirror and vase. We can then deduce that:
    - The table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
    - Any item(s) that must be auctioned before the table can only be on June 1st - June 4th.
    - Any item(s) that must be auctioned after the table can only be on June 6th.

  Option A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
    - The table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
    - If the harmonica is auctioned after the lamp, then the mirror and the vase must also be on the same day, violating the condition that the table is auctioned after both the mirror and vase.
    - Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.

  Option B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
    - We know that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th and the lamp can only be auctioned on June 1st - June 4th.

    - We know that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the sundial can only be auctioned on June 2nd - June 5th.
    - Therefore, this option cannot be true.

  Option D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
    - We know that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, so both the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st-June 4th.
    - We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
    - Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th for the mirror and vase to be auctioned on the earlier date(s) than the table, and it doesn't violate any of the conditions.
    - Therefore, this option could be true.

  Option E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
    - We know that the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, so both the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st-June 4th.
    - From the conditions, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, not earlier.

- If the table is auctioned after both the mirror and the vase;
- The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.

- If the harmonica is auctioned earlier than the table, then the lamp that follows the harmonica must also be auctioned earlier than the table since if it was auctioned later than the table it would mean that the table is not auctioned after both the mirror and the vase which is a contradiction.
- Therefore, it must be that the lamp is auctioned prior to the table and hence the table must be auctioned on June 6.
- Since the table is auctioned after the vase and the mirror, it must be that either the vase or the mirror are auctioned on June 2 or June 3. But, if the vase is auctioned on June 2 and the mirror on June 3, then the order of the first three auctions is fixed: sundial, harmonica, vase which is a contradiction and hence this scenario is impossible.

So, the only remaining options are the lamp and the run. Note that it is verified that the table cannot be auctioned on June 1.

A. We know that the table is auctioned on a later date than the harmonica, so this cannot be true.

- Since the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned and there is only one antique auctioned each day, the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
- Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, meaning that the harmonica and the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th as they are the antiques that are auctioned on June 1st and earlier than or on the same day as the table respectively. So, they can only be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.

- From statement 2, we know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.

Since the harmonica was auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, there is no possibility that it is auctioned on a date that is earlier than the table.

  We are told that the veterinarian is in space 5.
  We know that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4 or in space 6. 
  We are also told that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, assuming that a restaurant is at space 1, a restaurant can also be at space 7 or in-between spaces 2 and 4. It cannot be in space 6 as that will violate the rule that pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, we have the following arrangement:

The pharmacy must be at one end of the row which means the pharmacy should be in space 1 or space 7. 
Therefore, the Pharmacy must be in space 7 because it can’t be next to the optometrist or the restaurant so it could not be space 4 or space 5. 
If the Pharmacy is in space 7, then only Restaurants are eligible businesses to be located at the other end of the row.

3. If white is used in any rug, two other colors are used with it.
4. If olive is used in any rug, peach is also used with them.
5. Forest and turquoise cannot be used in the same rug.
6. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.

  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. 
  This means that if white is used, there are at least three colors used.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  This means that if peach is used in a rug, yellow cannot be used in that rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. 
  This means that if forest is used in a rug, turquoise cannot be used in that rug, and vice versa.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  This means that if peach is used in a rug, turquoise cannot be used in that same rug, and vice versa.
  The six colors available are: forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow.
  Exactly five of these colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  This means that only one color will not be used.
  If we try to put the colors together, assuming that they can be used in a single rug, we can have the following combinations:
  [White, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  [Olive, Peach, ?, ?, ?]
  [Peach, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  [Turquoise, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  [Yellow, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  The only possible combinations that satisfy the condition that each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs are: 
  [White, Olive, Peach, Turquoise, Yellow]
  [Forest, Olive, Peach, White, Yellow]
  [Forest, Olive, Turquoise, White, Yellow]
  In the first combination, turquoise and forest are not used, and peach is used.
  In the second combination, turquoise is not used, and peach is used.
  In the third combination, peach is not used, and turquoise is used.
  Therefore, we know that peach or turquoise or both are used in the rugs.

Since there are exactly 5 colors used to weave 3 rugs, at least 2 rugs will be solid-color, and 1 rug will be multicolored.

- If option A were true, then that means Forest could not be in any rug with any other color, but that violates the rule in the prompt that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, A is not true.

- If option B were true, then that means Turquoise cannot be used in any multicolored rugs, but that also violates the rule that turquoise could not be used in a rug with Peach, and Peach is not yet assigned. Therefore, B is not true.

- The prompt tells us that any rug with white has to use two additional colors, so that means the two solid-colored rugs that have white in them (2 out of 3 rugs) will have three colors: White + color1 + color2. All other rugs will be solid-colored, so we know there is at least one solid-colored rug with one color only, and since Peach cannot be combined with Yellow, Peach must be used in that rug. Therefore, C is true.

- Turquoise is not allowed to be used with Peach, Peach has been assigned to one of the solid-color rugs with White. Thus, Turquoise must be used in one of the multicolored rugs. Therefore, D is true.

    - Olive will be used with peach, so it cannot be used with any of the other three colors in a solid green rug.
    - Forest and Turquoise cannot be used in the same multicolored rug, which means that they could be used in solid colored rugs or different multicolored rugs.
    - Peach and Turquoise cannot be used in the same multicolored rug. This means that they could be used in different multicolored rugs or in a solid rug.
    - Peach and Yellow cannot be used in the same multicolored rug. Therefore, they could be used together in a solid rug or in different multicolored rugs.
  Based on these rules, we can conclude that yellow and peach must be used in either a solid or a multicolored rug.
  From the rules, turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug, and it can only be used in a solid rug.

  B) If turquoise were used in a multicolored rug, the other color could not be forest, peach, or yellow. The only available colors, in that case, would be olive, white, and yellow. The rule says that peach and yellow cannot be used together, but that would leave white as the only option to be paired with olive, which is not allowed. So it must be true that there are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C) If peach is not used in any rug, then the rug that contains olive must also contain turquoise, which violates one of the rules. So peach must be used in one of the rugs.
  D) If turquoise were not used at all, then the only colors that could be in a rug with olive and peach would be white and yellow. And a rug with forest could have only white or yellow as the other color. But that would leave no color options for the third rug, which is impossible. So turquoise must be used in one of the rugs.
  E) Yellow could be used in a rug with olive and peach (with olive and white or with peach and white). Yellow could also be used in a rug with white and forest. So it is possible that yellow is not used in any of the rugs.

  We can eliminate choices A and B because they both use ""no"" and this isn't a definite rule in this scenario. In other words, just because we haven't used a color doesn't mean we can't in the future.

Based on the given rules, we can infer the following:
- In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used: 3 colors in total are used in any rug where white is used.
- In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used: olive and peach are always together.
- Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
- Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Thus, to satisfy these conditions, there are three possible rugs. Assuming W is White, F is Forest, O is Olive, P is Peach, T is Turquoise, and Y is Yellow:
1. (W, A, B): This rug must consist of three colors total, where white is one of them and two other colors, say A and B, where A and B can be any two of the colors (excluding peach and yellow because they can't go together). However, we know that forest and turquoise can't go together, so forest can't be used. So A and B can be any two of the remaining four colors (forest is excluded): olive, peach, turquoise, and yellow. This means that A and B can't be forest and turquoise together. So this rug can either be solid or multicolored.
2. (O, P, X): This rug must be solid because it uses the mandatory olive and peach together, so there are no other colors left to add to this rug.
3. (X, Y, Z): This rug must consist of three colors total, where none of the colors could be peach or yellow (they can't go together). The only colors left are forest, olive, turquoise, and white. However, we know that forest and turquoise can't go together, so forest can't be used. So the colors used in this rug can be any of the remaining three colors (olive, turquoise, white), and they can be either solid or multicolored.

So, we can conclude that each rug can either be solid or multicolored. Also, turquoise and yellow are each used in one of the rugs, but forest is not used.
A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used. This could be true because we know that forest and turquoise can't go together, and the rules for the multicolored rugs are not given.
B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. This could be false because each rug can either be solid or multicolored, turquoise and yellow are each used in one of the rugs, and the rules for the multicolored rugs are not given.
C: Peach is used in one of the rugs. This must be true because olive and peach are always together (meaning one of the rugs will be olive and peach for sure). If this rug turns out to be a solid rug, then there are still two other rugs that need to use the remaining colors (with peach or without it).
D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs. This must be true because we know that each rug can either be solid or multicolored, and the color turquoise is one of six colors available.
E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs. This must be true because we know that each rug can either be solid or multicolored, and the color yellow is one of six colors available.

  - Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  - oil paintings and watercolor lectures must be earlier than lithographs lecture.
  
  If we start by drawing any sequence of the four lectures in random order, some of the constraints may be violated, as follows:
  - Farley can give either the sculptures lecture or the watercolors lecture but cannot present the lithographs or oil paintings lecture.
  - Holden can give either the sculptures lecture or the watercolors lecture but cannot present oil paintings or lithographs lecture.
  - If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture; then, Jiang will present either the watercolors or oil paintings lecture, and Farley will present the remaining lecture (oil paintings or watercolors). Garcia cannot, therefore, give the sculptures lecture.
  - If Holden gives oil paintings lecture, then Jiang and Garcia cannot present any lecture as they both have to have their talks after Holden's talk.
  - If Garcia presents the watercolors lecture, then Holden cannot present sculptures or paintings lectures, but Farley still can give any lectures which are not assigned. So, C is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. This is because if Holden presents the oil paintings lecture, neither Garcia nor Jiang can give any lectures.

  There are four different years and four different students will be assigned to each one, so each student can only be assigned to one year.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are only five remaining students: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  The other condition we can use right away is that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If we look at the statements that are related, we can see that if Mollie is assigned, she must be on 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned, Ryan must be assigned as well.
  If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be in the year before Ryan's.
  From here, we can make some conclusions:
  If Yoshio is not assigned, and only Louis or Tiffany can be in the 1923 project, then we have two possibilities: Tiffany is in 1923 and Louis is not assigned to the project, or Louis is in 1923 and Tiffany is not assigned to the project. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be as well. This means that Tiffany must be in 1923, which means Louis is not assigned to the project, and Ryan must be assigned to another year.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923, which means Ryan must also not be assigned to the project if Tiffany is not the one assigned to 1923.
  Either Onyx or Mollie can be assigned to 1922. However, if Ryan is assigned to the project and Onyx to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, that means Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, if Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  From here, we can eliminate some possibilities.
  Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, because Tiffany must be assigned to it. Therefore, we eliminate A and E.
  Ryan cannot be unassigned from the project, because if that was the case, Onyx would also be unassigned and that would leave only three students to be assigned to four years, which is impossible.
  We are left with two options: Tiffany is not assigned to the project, or Onyx is assigned to 1922. We need to eliminate one of these.
  If Tiffany is not assigned, and Louis is assigned to 1923, we have four students and four years to be assigned. If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx automatically must be assigned to 1922, and Ryan to 1924.

    B) Ryan is not assigned to the project: If Ryan is not assigned to the project, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project according to statement 2. This statement indicates that Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned to the project.

    C) Tiffany is not assigned to the project: If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, there is no violation of the given conditions. Therefore, this statement could be true.
    D) Onyx is assigned to 1922: If Onyx is assigned to 1922, Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must also be assigned to 1923 since she is the only other student available for that year. Then there is no student for 1921 or 1924. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.

Leaving Louis as the only possible partner of Yoshio which is not possible if Yoshio is not assigned. Therefore, assigning Mollie to 1922 is not valid.
    If Louis is not assigned to the project, then the remaining group of students (Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany) can be distributed among the remaining three years without violating any conditions of the problem.
    If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis will be assigned to 1923. Ryan will not be assigned because Tiffany is not assigned. Then, either Onyx is assigned to 1922 or Mollie is assigned to 1921. Therefore, this option is valid
    If Onyx is assigned to 1922, this makes Ryan assigned to 1923, Tiffany assigned to 1924, and Mollie assigned to 1921. Therefore, this option is valid.
    If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany will be assigned to 1923 and Ryan to 1922. However, because Ryan is assigned to 1922, Onyx should be assigned to 1921, and thus Mollie cannot be assigned. Therefore, this option is not valid.

  If textiles is in bay 4, then bay 3 and bay 5 would have produce and livestock and we can place the fuel and machinery in bay 1 and 6 in any order.

  We know that:
    - There are exactly six types of cargo, fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles.
    - The loading dock consists of exactly six bays 1 to 6.
    - Bay holding grain > Bay holding livestock
    - Bay holding livestock > Bay holding textiles
    - Bay holding produce > Bay holding fuel
    - Textiles is next to Produce
  We can use the given information to eliminate answer options. 
  The bay holding livestock has the lower number. The smallest bay number is 1. Therefore, the bay holding livestock must be either bay 1 or bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be bay 2 or bay 3.
  From the statement 'Bay holding produce > Bay holding fuel', we know that either:
    Bay holding fuel is bay 1 and Bay holding produce is bay 6, or
    Bay holding fuel is bay 2 and Bay holding produce is bay 6.
  Using the statement 'Textiles is next to Produce', we can eliminate an option that isn't possible, which is machinery since there are no more bays left to fill bay 5. Therefore, the cargo held in bay 5 must be machinery.
  To fill the rest of the bays:
    - Bay 1 is not fuel, grain, or livestock because of the conditions that follow in the clues. Therefore, Bay 1 must be either machinery, produce or textiles.
    - Bay 6 can not be textiles or produce since textiles is next to produce, which would require Bay 5 and Bay 6 both to hold textiles or produce. Therefore, Bay 6 is either fuel, grain, or livestock.
  With this information, we can deduce the following possibilities for each bay:
    Bay 1: machinery, produce, or textiles
    Bay 2: grain or livestock
    Bay 3: grain or livestock
    Bay 4: ?
    Bay 5: machinery
    Bay 6: fuel, grain, or livestock
  The statement 'The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles' means the bay holding textiles must be next to a smaller bay. This eliminates machinery as the cargo held in bay 1. Therefore the cargo held in bay 1 is either textiles or produce.
  The statement in the previous step and 'Textiles is next to Produce' mean that Bay 1 holds textiles and Bay 2 holds produce. So, bay 4 can't hold produce. From the answer options, only C: machinery, can't be the type of cargo held in bay 4.

  We know that the bay of textiles is next to the bay of produce. So they both cannot be in the bays 5 and 4 respectively, since there are no bays next to them.
  We also know that the bay of livestock is higher than the bay of textiles and any other cargo. So the bays of textiles and livestock will be 4 and 5, but we do not know which order.
  We further know that the bay of produce is higher than the bay of fuel. Therefore, the cargo in the bay 6 should be either produce or fuel and let's assume it is produce, then the cargo in bay 3 will not be a produce because we cannot have two produce cargoes next to each other. 
  Finally, we know that the cargo in the bay of grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. If we assume the bay of livestock is 5, the only available bay for grain will be 6. Therefore, we already know what is the cargo in the bays 5 and 6; livestock and produce respectively. 
  From the remaining cargos, we can put them in the other bays (1, 2, and 3) but we cannot put machinery in bay 4 because each bay must hold a different cargo.

  Produce has a higher number than Fuel, which means that Fuel has a lower number than Produce and that Fuel cannot be in Bay 4, as Bay 4 is surrounded by higher-numbered bays with Produce.

  Greene's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  We need to determine the position of Greene's oil and the wall on which Hidalgo's watercolor and oil are displayed.
  Since Franz's watercolor must be displayed on a wall other than the wall where his oil is displayed, Franz cannot be on the same wall as Greene and the same wall as Hidalgo.
  Since Isaacs oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, that means Isaacs's watercolor must be located on one of the other three walls.
  The two paintings of Hidalgo cannot be both in an upper position or both in the lower position, since only two paintings are displayed on each wall and since we know that one painting in each wall is an oil painting. So, one of Hildalgo's paintings must be in the upper position and the other in the lower position.
  There are only two walls remaining where Hidalgo's paintings can be placed because each wall must have at least two students represented. These two walls must each display one oil painting and one watercolor painting. 
  Wall 1 cannot have Hidalgo's work because it has already had one of the other three students on it and we know that no wall displays only one student's work.
  If Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3, because Isaacs's painting is in the lower position of wall 4 and because Franz's watercolor cannot go on wall 4. However, this possibility is not valid because wall 3 would then have only watercolors.
  So, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and his watercolor must be on wall 2.
  This means that Greene must display his oil on wall 2; consequently, his watercolor must be on wall 1. Wall 1 will thus have only one of Greene's paintings on it and one of Hidalgo's.
  Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil, and Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in an upper position. This leads to answer E.

If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there can only be three possible locations: optometrist in space 1 and shoe store in space 2, optometrist in space 2 and shoe store in space 3, or optometrist in space 6 and shoe store in space 7.
If the optometrist is in space 1, the shoe store is in space 2, and the pharmacy is at one end of the row, the pharmacy must be in space 7. However, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, and none is in space 6. Therefore, this scenario is impossible.

  Then, the pharmacy must be located in space 3 or space 7. However, it must be adjacent to either the optometrist (in space 2) or veterinarian (in space 4). This means that the optometrist cannot be next to the pharmacy, so therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7 adjacent to the optometrist in space 2.
  The two restaurants need to be separated by at least two other businesses, and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row while one of the restaurants is at the other. This means restaurant 1 can only be located in space 6.
  Now, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so toy store must be located in space 4. 
  The remaining business, which is the veterinarian, can only be located in space 5.

  Let's use the conditions one by one:
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. => So, we can't have more than one batch of any kind of cookies on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. => We have at least one batch of cookies made on Monday, but we don't know the type yet.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. => Let's start with the peanut butter cookies; we can have their first batch on Monday or later except Wednesday. If it is made on Monday, then we can have the second batch of oatmeal cookies on Monday as well. But, we don't know whether we'll have another oatmeal cookie batch on Friday or not; so, choice C seems invalid. The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday. If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, then the second batch of sugar cookies will also be made on that day, and we will have no valid options for Friday. So, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies was made on Tuesday, as well. 
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. => The third batch of oatmeal cookies have to be made on Friday. 
  So, according to these conditions, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday. Also, we found out that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, so it cannot be made on Tuesday; thus, we can eliminate choice B. Similarly, we found that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, so it cannot be made on Wednesday; thus, we can also eliminate choice D.

  - If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then we can have the first batch of sugar cookies on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies on Wednesday, which means the only remaining batch is the third batch of sugar cookies on Thursday.

  Similarly, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday, but not Wednesday or Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, therefore the first batch of sugar cookies will be made on either Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
  Given that one batch is made on Friday, we need to consider the possibilities.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, so choice C is not possible.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday which results in no batches for Thursday. Therefore, choice A is not possible.

  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
    There are three batches each of three types of cookie which means there will be a minimum of three days during which Monday, Thursday and Friday must already have a batch of sugar cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and on Friday, only one batch is made which means it cannot be sugar cookies. Therefore, this is false.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
    The second batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on Friday. No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, this is false.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
    The second batch of oatmeal cookies will be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Thus, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday. There is no batch of oatmeal cookies on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, this is false.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.

To solve the question, we must carefully examine all the provided details. 

Louise works the second shift on two consecutive days. Therefore, Louise must work on Thursday and Friday.
Katya works on Tuesday and Friday, so Katya must work on Tuesday's second shift.
On two nonconsecutive days, Grecia works the first shift. So, Grecia cannot work on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, Grecia works on Wednesday's first shift and Thursday's second shift.
Since no student can work two shifts on the same day, the shift pairs make the following possible pairs of students:
- Monday: Hakeem and Joe
- Tuesday: Louise and Hakeem/Joe
- Wednesday: Grecia and another student
- Thursday: another student and Louise/Grecia
- Friday: Katya and another student

The only possible shift pair for Monday is Hakeem and Joe. Also, since Grecia and Louise never work on the same day, and Louise works on Thursday and Friday, Grecia must work with Katya and this should be on Wednesday, which means Louise will work on Thursday with one of the other students. Hence, the only possible shift pairings are as follows:
- Monday: Hakeem (second shift) and Joe (first shift)
- Tuesday: Louise (second shift) and Katya (second shift)
- Wednesday: Grecia (first shift) and O (second shift)
- Thursday: L (first shift) and Joe/Hakeem (second shift)

  Katya works on Tuesday and Friday. Therefore, she can't work on any of the other days.
  Hakeem and Joe work on the same day as each other at least once. Therefore, Hakeem and Joe can work on {Monday, Wednesday, Thursday}, {Monday, Wednesday, Friday}, or {Wednesday, Thursday, Friday}.
  Grecia and Louise never work on the same day as each other. Therefore, if Grecia works on Monday or Tuesday, then Louise can't work on those days as well.

  The western begins before the horror movie, therefore the western must be scheduled for the 7 pm movie on either screen 1 or 2 because a movie is shown at 8 pm on screen 3. 
  The sci-fi movie is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2. Therefore the romance films can only be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  The horror and mystery movies are shown on different screens. Since the horror film has to be shown before the mystery film, it cannot be the 9 pm movie on the same screen as the mystery movie.
  Therefore, the horror movie can be shown at 7 pm on Screen 1 and the mystery movie can be shown at 9 pm, or vice versa. Or the mystery movie can be shown at 7 pm on Screen 1 and the horror movie at 9 pm, or the other way around.
  For Screen 2, the only remaining movies are the sci-fi and romance films.

  B: The mystery must be shown on the other screen of Screen 1 since the Horror film is not shown on this screen. This is a possible schedule for screen 2.
  C: The Western must be the 9 P.M. movie on Screen 1, therefore the sci-fi movie must be the 7 P.M. movie on screen 2 with the mystery as the 9 P.M. movie. So, this schedule is also possible.
  D: The Western must be the 7 P.M. movie on one of the screens, we already know that the Mystery is shown on the other 7 P.M. movie, and the Western must begin before the Horror movie which indicates that it should be shown on 7 P.M. movie on one of the screens.

  Since the pharmacy cannot be in space 2 or 6 and one of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, the only possibility for the pharmacy is space 1 or space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2. But the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be in space 1 or space 7.

  Similarly, peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. So, if one solid rug is of peach color, the other solid rug cannot be of yellow color and vice versa.
  
    Scenario 1: If the first solid rug color is forest,
                We cannot choose peach color in the second rug, as forest and peach cannot be used together. 
                As a result, the second solid rug color cannot be peach or turquoise.
                
    Scenario 2: If the first solid rug color is peach,
                We cannot choose yellow color in the second rug, as peach and yellow cannot be used together.

    Scenario 4: If the first solid rug color is one of the colors other than forest, peach, turquoise,
                We can choose any color except forest and turquoise for the second solid rug.

We are asked to identify two colors that cannot be used if there are exactly two solid rugs. The total number of rugs is not specified. Given the rules, we can identify possible solid rugs as follows: 
1. If a rug uses white, it contains three colors (including white).
2. If a rug uses olive, it contains two colors.
3. If a rug uses forest, it does not use turquoise.
4. If a rug uses peach, it does not use turquoise, yellow.
5. If a rug uses yellow, it does not use peach.

Let's examine the options:

A. forest and peach. 
   - It is possible that one rug is solid forest, and the other rug is solid peach, as long as neither rug uses turquoise or yellow. 
   - Therefore, we cannot eliminate this option.

B. forest and yellow. 
   - It is possible that one rug is solid forest, and the other rug is solid yellow, as long as neither rug uses turquoise or peach. 
   - Therefore, we cannot eliminate this option.

C. peach and turquoise. 
   - It is not possible to have two solid rugs with these colors because they cannot be used together in the same rug.
   - Therefore, we can eliminate this option.

D. peach and yellow. 
   - It is not possible to have two solid rugs with these colors because yellow cannot be used with peach.
   - Therefore, we can eliminate this option.

E. turquoise and yellow.
   - It is possible that one rug is solid turquoise, and the other rug is solid yellow, as long as neither rug uses forest or peach.
   - Therefore, we cannot eliminate this option.

Since options C and D violate the rules for solid rugs, we can eliminate them. Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or E. However, we have shown that A and B are possible. Thus, the answer is E: turquoise and yellow.

  There are six colors but only five can be used. Therefore, one color must be excluded.
  White must be excluded since it must be used together with another two colors.
  Olive is used together with peach, so they must be used together in one of the multicolored rugs.
  Forest and turquoise, whenever used, must never be together with each other. Therefore, they could both be used in one of the solid rugs, or one in each of the solid rugs chosen.
  Peach and turquoise, whenever used, must never be together with each other. Therefore, they could both be used in one of the multicolored rugs, or one in each of the multicolored rugs chosen.
  Peach and yellow must never be together in any of the rugs. Therefore, they should not be used in the same solid or multicolored rug.
  Having said that, let's analyze the answer choices.
  If forest and peach are used together in a solid color rug, the other solid rug cannot have yellow as one of its colors, so we won't be able to comply with the rules.
  If forest and yellow are used together in a solid color rug, the other solid rug could have peach as one of its colors since forest and peach are not restricted to be used together.
  If peach and turquoise are used together in a multicolored rug, it is possible to meet the requirements of the remaining rugs.
  If peach and yellow are used together in a rug, it is impossible to comply with the rules since yellow cannot be mixed with peach in any rug.
  If turquoise and yellow are used together in a rug, it is impossible to comply with the rules since peach cannot be used with turquoise in any rug.

   We have a total of 6 colors available and exactly 5 colors will be used to weave the rugs.

   If there are exactly 2 solid rugs, then that means the third rug would be multicolored.
   From the rules, we can conclude that olive will be used in a multicolored rug, and if olive is used, peach must also be used.
   This means that olive and peach will be part of the multicolored rug and cannot be part of a solid rug.
   From the remaining colors, we need to choose two colors to create a solid rug.
   Neither of these two colors can be forest because the rule states that forest cannot be used together with turquoise and we know that turquoise will be used since it's not part of the excluded choices (C, D, E).

  The remaining two available colors that can be used with white are peach and turquoise.
  The multicolored rug cannot have olive or forest, since if either of these two were used, then both peach and turquoise would also need to be used, which exceeds the number of available colors.
  Therefore, the two solid rugs must use a combination of the remaining three colors, forest, olive, and yellow.
  From the rules, we know that forest and turquoise are not used together. As such, forest, olive, and yellow must be used as solid rug colors.

  The problem requires selecting three workers to be project members, with one of them as the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must be a project member as well.
  If Wells is a project member, then both Ruiz and Verma cannot be.
  If Verma can be the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be the project leader.
  We can use process of elimination to find the correct answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then both Ruiz and Verma are available choices for the project leader. 
    However, if Verma is selected, then Ruiz cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then one of Smith or Wells must be a project member.
    If Smith is chosen, then Taylor must also be chosen, leaving only one spot left for project member. But either Ruiz or Verma cannot be chosen, violating the constraint.
    Similarly, if Wells is chosen, then we can only choose Smith and Taylor, leading to the same constraint violation.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells must be a project member.
    However, this is contradictory to the fact that both Ruiz and Verma cannot be a project member if Wells is also a project member (constraint violation).
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, we can at most choose Wells, Ruiz, and Verma to avoid the above constraint violation.
    However, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be the project leader since Verma will not be able to be a project member, leaving only Wells as the possible project leader (which is not the case).
  If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then we can have any of the combinations of Smith, Ruiz, and Verma as project members along with their teammates except for Verma as the project leader since either Wells or Smith need to be project member.

  For Verma to be selected as the project leader, one of Quinn or Ruiz must be selected and the other must not be selected. It is because Quinn or Ruiz can only become a project member if they are leading the project.

    4. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The first to perform a solo cannot be the guitarist because they do not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the only potential option for the first to perform a solo is the percussionist.
  Through the third restriction, we know that the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist. So, violinist cannot perform the third solo.
  According to the fourth restriction, the saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform after the percussionist or the trumpeter. 
  For the saxophonist to perform third, the percussionist will have to perform first, and the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist.

To determine who cannot perform the third solo, let's use the restrictions to narrow down the possibilities:
- The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
- The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
- The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
- The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
From these restrictions, we can deduce that the order of the soloists is somewhat like this: percussionist - (saxophonist/trumpeter) - violinist - keyboard player - guitarist. We know that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Thus they perform either first, second, or third. Let's check each of the answer choices to find out who CANNOT perform third:
- (A) If the guitarist performs third, it means they broke the restriction that they cannot perform fourth. Eliminated.

  From the given restrictions above, the fourth solo cannot be performed by the guitarist.
  By the time the guitarist performs his solo, the keyboard player has already performed. So the keyboard player has to perform before the fourth solo which is not played by the guitarist. Thus, the keyboard player must play the second solo.
  Also, the saxophonist must play the fifth or sixth solo due to the given restriction. 
  To perform third solo at some time after the violinist and before the guitarist, the following solo order is obtained: violinist, keyboard player, saxophonist, trumpeter, guitarist, percussionist.

  To determine which band member cannot perform the third solo, let's create a timeline of the performances and apply the restrictions.
  1. We know that there are only six solos in total, and every member only performs one solo. Hence, the performance order is fixed.
  2. If the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, then he can perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  3. The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player. So, the percussionist performs either the first or the second solo.
  4. The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist. Options that before the guitarist are the second and third solos. So, we know that after the violinist performs, the keyboard player is performing either second or the third solo.
  5. The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. The saxophonist can perform the third, fourth or the fifth solo.
  6. The violinist can perform either the first, second, or third solo since the saxophonist's solo must come after his solo.
  7. Since each member performs exactly one solo, the trumpeter must perform either the fifth or sixth solo.
  8. Based on the above restriction, the only possible order for the solos is Solo1=Per1, Solo2=Per4, Solo3=Per2, Solo4=Per6, Solo5={Per3,Per5}, Solo6={Per3, Per5}, where Per1-6 represent the members.
  9. Therefore, the saxophonist can potentially perform the third solo along with the violinist because their solos can happen in either order and be followed by the keyboard player.

  According to the information given:
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Hence, Kammer's audition must be the first or second audition.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded and the fifth one must be recorded. Therefore, the sequence of auditions would be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 1, 2, 5, 3, 6.
  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition can only be the first, second, or third audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition must be either first, second, third, or fourth. Thus, Trillo's audition must be fifth.
  - From the above two points, we can infer that the sequence of auditions would be: 1, 2, 5, 3, 6.
  - Thus, from our reasoning, the only option available as the sixth audition is Waite's audition.

* None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
* The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

We need to find the possible combinations of the photographs that satisfy all the constraints.

Let's say:
- L1 and L2 are the photographs in the Lifestyle section
- M1 and M2 are the photographs in the Metro section
- S1 and S2 are the photographs in the Sports section

Given the constraint, since one of the photographs in Lifestyle is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, we can assume:
- L1 is by Gagnon and L2 is by Hue (or vice versa)

Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, possibilities are:
- M1 is by Fuentes and M2 is by either Gagnon or Hue
- M1 is by either Gagnon or Hue and M2 is by Fuentes

None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, thus:
- S1 is either by Fuentes or Hue
- S2 is by Fuentes if S1 is by Hue (so that the numbers of Hue's photographs in Lifestyle and Fuentes's photographs in Sports are equal) or S2 is by Hue if S1 is by Fuentes.

If one batch is made on Friday, then no batches of oatmeal or peanut butter can be made on Tuesday, so two batches of sugar cookies and one batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies would then be made on Tuesday, which is not possible because the same kind of cookies cannot be on the same day. Only one possible arrangement is Tuesday: oatmeal cookies, peanut butter cookies, and sugar cookies.

  There are five working days from Monday to Friday.

  From the first condition, we need to allocate the three batches of cookies for each day of the week. We have six batches of cookies to be allocated (3 oatmeal cookies, 3 peanut butter cookies, and 3 sugar cookies). Using the conditions given, we can create the following list:
  Monday : oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1, sugar 1 
  Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2, sugar 2
  Wednesday: 
  Thursday: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 3, sugar 2
  Friday : oatmeal 3, peanut butter 3, sugar 3  
  
  From the condition given, we know that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday. Therefore, there must be two batches of cookies on either Monday or Thursday.
  
  If two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then the batches made can be either of the following:
  Monday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1
  Monday: oatmeal 1, sugar 1
  Monday: peanut butter 1, sugar 1
  
  For each of these options, we can see that the batches made on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday would violate the first condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, option C is not true.
  
  If two batches of cookies were made on Thursday, then these must be oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2, and the batches on Tuesday would have to be sugar 2, which violates the first condition. Therefore D is not true.
  
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday and there are two batches of cookies on Monday or Thursday, we must make three batches of cookies on Tuesday and Wednesday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday AND exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. 
  
  Option A is not true because we cannot have more than one batch of the same kind of cookie on the same day.

  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Also, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

  Thursday: 2 batches (1 oatmeal and 1 sugar)

  If exactly one batch was made on Monday, then a total of 4 batches will be made in the first four days and so Friday would need to have 5 batches which is impossible. Hence, at least two batches are made on Monday.
  Also, since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and we already have 2 sugar batches (on Thursday and Friday), the third sugar batch cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.

  Giving away a class 2 building would require Trustcorp to receive two class 3 buildings in return, making it impossible for them to have any class 2 buildings after the trade.
  This also means that in order for Trustcorp to give up a class 2 building, it must receive a class 1 building in return to make up for the value difference.
  Since RealProp is the only company owning any class 1 buildings, it is the only one capable of making a trade that would allow Trustcorp to give up a class 2 building.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite should not be in slot 5 or 6. And, since Vegemite performs before Zircon, it cannot be in slot 6.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert should be in slot 5 or 6.

If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then 
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert(COND.2), and
  If Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots (COND.4) and Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, it follows that Yardsign cannot perform in the first slot.
    - If Wellspring performs first, this violates COND.2 because Wellspring would not perform before Xpert.
    - If Wellspring performs in the second slot, then Xpert would have to perform in the third slot to adhere to the condition that Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert. This means Yardsign would have to perform in slot one, which violates COND.4.
    - If Yardsign performs in the second slot, then Wellspring would have to perform in the first slot to adhere to condition 4 and Xpert again in slot three. Therefore, this scenario violates the condition of ""Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.""
    - This means Yardsign performs in slot three. Now only 2 slots are available, and according to COND. 1 Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Zircon can't perform in the first two slots, so it follows that Vegemite must perform in the third slot or later. This means Zircon must perform in slot 5 or 6 and Uneasy in either of the last two slots.
  Now, let's examine each option based on the slot placement of these bands:
    A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
      If Uneasy performs in slot 5, then Zircon must perform in slot six (COND.1), and Uneasy must perform in slot six(COND.3). Therefore, this option is not possible.
    B: Vegemite performs in slot three. 
      Vegemite must perform in slot 3 or later as per COND. 1. Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots(COND.4), and Uneasy must perform in slot five or six(COND.3). Therefore, this option is possible.
    C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
      If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Xpert will perform in slot 4, and Zircon must perform at slot six (COND.2, and COND.1). Therefore, this option is not possible.
    D: Zircon performs in slot two.
      This is not possible as per COND. 1.
    E: Zircon performs in slot four.
      If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring will perform in slot 3, and Xpert will perform in slot 5(COND.2). Therefore, this option is possible.

To solve the problem, we need to apply all the rules given.
1. For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
2. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
3. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
4. None of Gagnon's photographs can appear in the Sports section.

A: violates rule 3 because there is one Fuentes photograph in the Sports section, but no photographs by Hue in the Lifestyle section. Wrong.
B: violates rule 4 because there is one Gagnon photograph in the Sports section. Wrong.
C: violates rule 2 because there is no photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. In addition, it is not specified how many photographs by Fuentes should be in the Sports section. Wrong.
D: satisfies all the rules. Correct.
E: violates rules 1 and 3 because there are two photographs by Hue in Lifestyle and in Sports sections but, there is only one Fuentes photograph in the Sports section. Wrong.

Therefore, the answer is D: Lifestyle: both photographs by Gagnon Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon Sports: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Hue

  We need to select 6 photographs from 3 photographers (Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue)
  There are some constraints to follow:
    - Each photographer must have at least one photograph in the given three sections and at most three photographs in the same section.
    - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be equal to the number of Fuentes's photographs in the Sports section.
    - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section
  Let's analyze each option to check which one satisfies all the constraints.
  
Option A:
  Lifestyle: Both by Fuentes -> Fuentes has both in Lifestyle (Not valid as Fuentes have 0 in Metro & 0 in Sports)
  Metro: One Gagnon One Fuentes -> Fuentes has both in Metro (Valid)
  Sports: One Gagnon One Hue -> Both Gagnon & Hue appear in Sports (Not valid as Gagnon is not allowed in Sports section)
  
Option B:
  Lifestyle: One Fuentes One Gagnon -> Both appear in Lifestyle (Valid)
  Metro: One Fuentes One Gagnon -> Both appear in Metro (Valid)
  Sports: Both Hue -> Hue has both in Sports (Valid)
  
Option C:
  Lifestyle: Both Fuentes -> Fuentes have both in Lifestyle (Not valid as per the rule of Metro section)
  Metro: Both Gagnon -> Gagnon has both in Metro (Not valid as Fuentes is not there in Metro)
  Sports: Both Hue -> Hue has both in Sports (Valid)
  
Option D:
  Lifestyle: Both Gagnon -> Gagnon has both in Lifestyle (Not valid as we can't have Hue in Lifestyle but he appears in Sports. So when Hue appears in Sports, Fuentes should have been there in Lifestyle as per constraint#3)
  Metro: One Fuentes One Gagnon -> Both appear in Metro (Valid)
  Sports: One Fuentes One Hue -> Hue appears in Sports (Valid)
  
Option E:
  Lifestyle: One Gagnon One Hue -> Hue is in Lifestyle and they both appear (Valid)
  Metro: Both Hue -> Hue has both in Metro (Not valid per constraint#2 as photographer in the lifestyle section should have appeared in the Metro section)
  Sports: One Fuentes One Hue -> Hue appears in Sports (Valid)
  
  The only valid selection is option B.
  So, the answer is B: Lifestyle: One Fuentes One Gagnon Metro: One Fuentes One Gagnon Sports: Both Hue.

  At least one photograph in Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in Metro section.
  Therefore, either Fuentes or Gagnon should have a photograph in both Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, and there should at least be one Fuentes and one Hue photograph in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  The above conditions make option B a valid selection:
    Lifestyle: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon
    Metro: one photograph by Fuentes and one by Gagnon

  Greyhounds only appear on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days and not on day 1.
  If Himalayans are featured on a day, Rottweilers cannot be featured on that day.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.
  Using these constraints, let's evaluate the choices:
  A. If Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2, then Himalayans must be featured on day 3 to satisfy the constraint that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days. However, this conflicts with the constraint that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1.
  B. Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 since no breed featured on day 1 can be featured on day 7.
  C. If Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4, then Himalayans cannot be featured on either day 5 or 6. Thus, Himalayans must be featured on days 2, 3, and 7. However, this conflicts with the constraint that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1.
  D. If Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5, then Himalayans cannot be featured on days 3 or 4. Thus, the remaining days for featured Himalayans are days 2 and 6. Furthermore, the remaining breed for day 6 is Newfoundland, which means that Newfoundlands and Manx cannot be featured on day 6.
  E. If Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6, then Himalayans cannot be featured on days 4 or 5. Thus, the remaining days for featured Himalayans are days 2, 3, and 7. Furthermore, Siamese and Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 7 since they appeared on days 5 and 6 respectively. Thus, the remaining breed for day 7 is Manx. Given that Manx appear on day 7, then Rottweilers cannot appear on day 5. This eliminates answer choice D.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.

  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Using the above conditions, we can create a chart to see which breeds can be featured on each day.

  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. (This violates the condition that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, this option is not true.)
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. (This violates the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, this option is not true.)
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. (This satisfies all the given conditions and is feasible. Therefore, this option could be true.)
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. (This satisfies all the given conditions and is feasible. Therefore, this option could be true.)
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. (This violates the condition that no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, this option is not true.)
  
Conclusion:
  Options (C) and (D) are both feasible. Therefore, the answer is either (C) or (D). 
  However, we are asked to select only one option. So, we need additional information or context to decide between (C) and (D). 
  If such information or context was not given in the original problem description, we cannot determine with certainty which option is true.

- Himalayans is not featured on day 1 and is featured on exactly 3 days
- Rottweilers is not featured on day 7 and is not featured on the same day that has Himalayans
Action: 
- For (A), Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. Since no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Then on day 3 there would be either a kitten or a puppy breed that would have been featured on day 1. So (A) is not possible.
- For (B), it's not possible since Himalayans can only be featured on a maximum of 2 days when considering the above conditions.
- For (C), Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. So the possible days for Himalayans to be featured are 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. However, Rottweilers cannot be featured on the same day as Himalayans, so what is left is only day 2 for Himalayans and day 4 for Rottweilers to satisfy the given conditions, so (C) is a possible outcome.
- For (D), Rottweilers can be featured on day 2 or day 3, with Himalayans being featured on day 4 and 5. Therefore, (D) is not possible.

  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Using the above conditions we will test each option.
  
Option A: 
  Greyhounds were featured on day 1, so they can not be featured on day 2.
  This option violates the condition where no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Therefore, option A is impossible.

Option B:
  Greyhounds were featured on day 1, so they can not be featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they can be featured on day 7.
  Therefore, it is possible for Greyhounds and Himalayans to both be featured on day 7.
  The answer is B.

Option C:
  Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Himalayans appear on the exact three days only.
  Therefore, it is impossible for Rottweilers and Himalayans to both be featured on day 4.
  Hence, option C is not possible.

Option D:
  No breed is featured on two consecutive days.
  Day 5 follows day 4.
  It's impossible for Rottweilers and Manx to both be featured on day 5.

- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. So, Himalayans should not be on consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. So, both Greyhound and Himalayans can't be on day 7.
- Rottweilers are not on Day 7.
- Himalayans are not with Rottweilers.

A. Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
- In this case, the breed on Day 1 is Greyhound, and the breed on Day 3 cannot be Siamese, so there is no solution to Day 2. This option can't be true.

B. Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
- Both Greyhound and Himalayans can't be on Day 7. This option can't be true.

C. Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
- No breed should be on consecutive days. Himalayans are not on Day 1. On Day 3, Himalayans can't be there. On Day 5, there shouldn't be Himalayans either. So, it will contradict the rules. This option can't be true.

D. Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. 
- From the given options, this option seems reasonable.
- On Day 1, Greyhounds, and on Day 2, Himalayans.
- On Day 3, three possible breeds are Siamese, Newfoundland, and Manx. Siamese can't be there, and Manx is the only breed that is not contradicting the rules. Therefore, Manx is on Day 3.
- On Day 4, Siamese is the only breed left from the three breeds to be featured. 
- On Day 5, Rottweilers.
- On Day 6, Newfoundland.

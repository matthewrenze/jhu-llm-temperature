  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference of the volunteers for Sparkle Cola is due to its taste.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.

  The argument states that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them.
  The argument provides evidence that people who watch an above-average amount of television are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster than if they do not.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find an answer choice that suggests that the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks is not as strong as the argument suggests.
  Answer choice A does not address the relationship between watching television and overestimating risks.
  Answer choice B suggests that people who watch an above-average amount of television are less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice C suggests that people who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster, which weakens the argument.
  Answer choice D suggests that people who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television, which weakens the argument.

  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty for pollution.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that stronger evidence is needed or the perpetrator admits responsibility to justify imposing the penalty.
  The principle that best justifies the reasoning in the argument is that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  This principle aligns with the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.

  The argument is that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  The argument rejects Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The assumption that enables the conclusion of the argument to be properly drawn should support the idea that we can only praise or blame a person for an action if we know a lot about the events that led to that action.
  Choice A is close, but it goes too far by saying that people should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control.
  Choice B is also close, but it is not specific enough to support the conclusion of the argument.

  The pharmacist argues that a study showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are alleviated by ingesting melatonin.
  The pharmacist concludes that the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are correct.
  The argument is flawed because the study does not support the conclusion.
  The study shows that melatonin alleviates insomnia's symptoms, but it does not support the claim that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages.

  The scientist's argument is that the iguana species on the islands must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that contradicts this claim.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B does not contradict the argument, but rather supports the idea that the iguana species on the islands are different from those found in the Americas.
  Choice C is also irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice D contradicts the argument by stating that fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia, which means that the progenitors of the species on the islands could have come from Australia instead of the Americas.

  The editorialist argues that increasing air traffic beyond the airport's original design capacity would decrease safety.
  The council members argue that the increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist claims that numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology.
  The editorialist's argument is flawed because it assumes that the latest safety technology is the same as the one used 30 years ago.

  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address other factors that may affect the safety of bicyclists.
  Choice A is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice B is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice C is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice D is not relevant to the argument.
  Choice E is the most relevant to the argument because it suggests that the argument uses statistical evidence that fails to support its conclusion.

  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which means that the polar bear may have used other senses to find its way home.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which means that the polar bear may have been familiar with the area.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet they have the same likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same for both captive and wild leatherbacks. If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then the ones that survive are likely to live long enough to reach their maximum life expectancy.

Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.

  The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  The question asks which action is most justified by the principle stated by the university president.
  The action that is most justified is the one that aligns with the principle stated by the university president.
  Choice A is not justified because the research has no relation to practical concerns.
  Choice B is not justified because it does not relate to practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice C is not justified because it does not relate to promoting research in any field of theoretical investigation that shows promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice D is not justified because it sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior, which is not related to practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice E is justified because it funds an investigation into the mathematical properties of folded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease, which is related to practical problems that affect people's quality of life.

  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is a conflict between the two statements.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find an option that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for this conflict by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The argument is based on the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear.
  The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather makes a claim about the species as a whole.
  The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity, as it explicitly states that it is an innate behavior.
  The argument does not change the meaning of the word ""behavior"" during the course of the argument.
  The argument does not presume that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways.
  The argument does not appeal to the authority of science in an incorrect way.

Option A: The argument is valid as it states that Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract.
Option B: The argument is valid as it states that Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipment of goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid.
Option C: The argument is not valid as it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. The principle does not state that if an offer is legitimate, the other party will accept it.
Option D: The argument is valid as it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.

Option C: The argument is not valid as it states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. The principle does not state that if an offer is legitimate, the other party will accept it.
Option D: The argument is valid as it states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract.
Option E: The argument is not valid as it states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. The principle does not state that if an offer is not legitimate, there is no valid contract between the parties.
Therefore, the answer is either A or B.

  The argument concludes that there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class based on the premise that most of the sociology majors are taking the class while most of the psychology majors are not.
  This conclusion is flawed because it assumes that the number of students in each major is equal, which is not necessarily true.
  Choice B is similar in that it assumes that the number of residents who did not express an opinion is negligible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks.

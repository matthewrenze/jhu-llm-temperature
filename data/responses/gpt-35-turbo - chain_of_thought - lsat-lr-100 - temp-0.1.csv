  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other factors that may influence the preference of the volunteers.
  Option D suggests that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  This is a valid criticism of the reasoning in the advertisement.

  Option D supports the argument by stating that the decrease in patient injuries began only after the staff became aware that their errors were being closely monitored.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

  The argument states that the implementation of the plan to record staff errors has led to a decrease in patient injuries.
  To strengthen the argument, we need to find an option that supports the idea that the decrease in patient injuries is due to the implementation of the plan.
  Option B is irrelevant to the argument because it talks about a hospital that did not participate in the plan.
  Option C weakens the argument because it suggests that the plan was not comprehensive.
  Option E is also irrelevant to the argument because it talks about the consequences of staff errors, not the effectiveness of the plan.
  Option A is not relevant to the argument because it talks about the hospital's policy before the implementation of the plan.
  Option D suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was due to the staff's awareness of the close analysis of the records. This supports the argument that the knowledge of monitoring made the staff more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties.

  The argument is about the justification of imposing a penalty on the local auto repair shop for polluting the river.
  The argument states that the penalty for this type of pollution is severe.
  The argument also states that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  The principle that best justifies the reasoning in the argument is that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  This principle aligns with the argument's reasoning that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed to justify imposing the penalty.

  Option D suggests that polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option E suggests that polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory, which does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers away.
  We need to find an option that casts doubt on the validity of the evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. This suggests that the polar bear may have found its way home by chance rather than by navigation.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. This supports the naturalists' claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  Option C suggests that the route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. This does not cast doubt on the validity of the evidence.

  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild.
  However, the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild.
  The apparent discrepancy is that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases, but they still have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  To resolve the discrepancy, we need to find an answer that explains why leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases but still have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.
  Option C provides a possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy by stating that most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. This suggests that the fatal diseases that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to may not be as deadly as the predators in the wild, which could explain why leatherbacks in captivity have the same likelihood of reaching their theoretical maximum life expectancy as those in the wild.

  The argument states that leatherbacks in captivity are susceptible to fatal diseases that they would never come in contact with in the wild, yet their likelihood of reaching their maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  To resolve this discrepancy, we need to find a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  Option C provides a reason why the likelihood of reaching maximum life expectancy is the same in both environments.
  If most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators, then it is possible that the ones that survive are the ones that are not susceptible to predators and diseases.
  Therefore, option C most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy.

  Choice A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C: Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.
  The answer is either A or B.

  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is a conflict between the two statements.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find a statement that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the fact that shore environments had abundant and reliable food resources.
  Option E provides a possible explanation for this conflict by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The study found that workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  We need to find an option that explains why workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control.
  Option A is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Option B is a possible explanation, but it does not directly relate to the study's findings.
  Option C is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Option D is not relevant to the study's findings.
  Option E is a possible explanation, as it suggests that office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. This could mean that the workers with the most control over their own work are less likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome because they are not typing as much.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work.

  The argument does not generalize from the behavior of a few bears, but rather makes a claim about the species as a whole.
  The argument does not fail to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity, but rather argues that it is completely natural behavior for Kodiak bears.

  The medical researcher's argument is that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries.
  We need to find an option that weakens this argument.
  Option A states that the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries for both groups of joggers compared by the scientists.
  This means that both groups of joggers had fewer injuries than expected, which could mean that stretching before jogging helped to prevent injuries.
  Therefore, option A weakens the medical researcher's argument.

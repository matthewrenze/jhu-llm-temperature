  The argument in the advertisement is that most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
  The argument is based on a survey of a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument assumes that the sample is representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
  The argument also assumes that the sample is representative of all people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies.
  The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  Therefore, the answer is C: It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.

  The argument assumes that the survey is reliable and that the sample is representative.
  The argument does not address the possibility of other factors that could affect the savings of the policyholders.
  Choice A criticizes the argument for overlooking the possibility that some policyholders saved little or no money when they switched to Popelka.
  Choice B criticizes the argument for assuming that new policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
  Choice C criticizes the argument for failing to address the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
  Choice D criticizes the argument for assuming that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  Choice E criticizes the argument for failing to address the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.
  Choice A, B, C, and E are all valid criticisms of the argument.

  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  Option C suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. If planners trade goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically, it can solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.

  The argument claims that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists.
  The argument supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks other factors that could affect the safety of bicyclists.
  Choice A is a possible criticism because the argument does not consider the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes compared to those on roads without such lanes.
  Choice B is not a valid criticism because the argument is based on the number of collisions, not the number of bicyclists.
  Choice C is not a valid criticism because the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  Choice D is not a valid criticism because the argument does not claim that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe.
  Choice E is not a valid criticism because the argument is based on statistical evidence that supports a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists.

  The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat.
  However, universal adoption of such a diet would lead to the extinction of marine species.
  Therefore, the argument concludes that such a diet should not be recommended universally.
  Option C presents a similar argument where a spending pattern is recommended but universal adoption of the same would lead to a severe recession.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people.

Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet.
Option A presents a similar argument where taking vitamin E supplements every day reduces the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, the argument concludes that we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
Option B presents an argument where governments can tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. However, if these taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, the argument concludes that such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
Option C presents an argument where a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people.

Option D presents an argument where legislators spending less time campaigning would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. Therefore, the argument concludes that it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
Option E presents an argument where restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But it also reduces the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, the argument concludes that it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Option A, B, C, and E present arguments that are similar in structure to the argument in the question stem. However, option A is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. Option B is not the best answer because it is not about a trade-off. Option C is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. Option E is not the best answer because it is not about a dilemma. 
Therefore, the best answer is D: If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.

  Choice C describes a situation where Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, but he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E describes a situation where Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves on Rodriguez's farm. Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there.
  The only choice that aligns with the principle stated in the context is B.

  The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  The question asks which action is most justified by the principle stated by the university president.
  The action that is most justified is the one that aligns with the principle stated by the university president.
  Choice A is not justified because the research has no relation to practical concerns.
  Choice B is not justified because the research does not show promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice C is not justified because it does not involve promoting research in any field of theoretical investigation that shows promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
  Choice D is not justified because the research proposal sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior, which is a practical problem that affects people's quality of life.

  The passage states that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The passage also states that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The apparent conflict is that the food resources that could support the high-calorie diet were not available in the savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find an answer that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the lack of food resources that could support the high-calorie diet.
  Answer choice E provides a possible explanation for this conflict by stating that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The argument assumes that the speaker's personal experience is representative of the general population.
  The argument does not provide any evidence to support the claim that the official results are rigged.
  The argument fails to consider the possibility that the speaker's social circle is not representative of the general population.
  Therefore, the flaw in the reasoning of the argument is that it uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.

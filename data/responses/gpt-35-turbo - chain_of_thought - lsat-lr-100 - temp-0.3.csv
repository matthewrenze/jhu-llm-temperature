  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference of the volunteers for Sparkle Cola is due to its taste.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  Therefore, the answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.

This statement supports the argument because it suggests that the hospitals were already careful about investigating serious staff errors before the implementation of the plan. Therefore, the decrease in patient injuries can be attributed to the plan.
  Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the decrease in patient injuries was not due to the implementation of the plan but rather due to the staff becoming aware that the records were being closely analyzed.

  The argument also states that the identity of the polluter is uncertain.
  The argument concludes that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
  The reasoning in the argument is based on the principle that the severity of the penalty should be proportional to the certainty of guilt.
  Therefore, the principle that best justifies the reasoning in the argument is A: The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

  The economists suggest that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population could solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  To support this assertion, we need to find an option that shows that trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population could solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.
  Option C suggests that a scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. If urban areas trade goods or services to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically, it could solve the problems resulting from increasing urbanization.

  The argument is that the viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  The answer choice that most seriously undermines the argument is the one that weakens the assumption that the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate, then the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may not have been biased in favor of Lopez.
  If most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez, then the argument is further supported.
  If the people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate, then the argument is further supported.

The argument states that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat, but if everyone adopted this diet, it would lead to the extinction of marine species. Therefore, the universal adoption of such a diet should not be recommended.
Option A talks about the evidence of vitamin E supplements reducing the risk of heart attack, but it is not conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, recommending everyone to take vitamin E supplements every day should not be done.
Option B talks about how governments can tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education, but if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
Option C talks about how a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
Option D talks about how legislators would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected if they spent less time campaigning. However, if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
Option E talks about how restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many species that inhabit these areas. However, it also reduces the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas. Therefore, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

  The naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances.
  The evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim is that a polar bear returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away.
  We need to find the option that casts the most doubt on the validity of this evidence.
  Option A suggests that the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, which means that the polar bear may have found its way home by chance rather than by navigation.
  Option B suggests that the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, which means that the polar bear may have found its way home by following its migration route rather than by navigation.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D suggests that polar bears are not unique in their ability to find their way home from considerable distances, which means that the evidence offered may not be specific to polar bears.

  More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary.
  Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is that it is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week.

  The argument states that if the party's economic theories were sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. 
  However, the inflation rate actually increased, so the party's economic theories were off the mark.
  The argument assumes that the party's economic theories were sound, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  The argument also assumes that the party's program was not implemented, but it does not provide any evidence to support this assumption.
  Therefore, the flawed reasoning in the argument above is that it makes unsupported assumptions.
  The argument that most closely resembles this flawed reasoning is C: If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price of the stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.

  The principle that best justifies the columnist's reasoning is that a bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law if the democracy is well-functioning.
  Therefore, the answer is B: If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law.

  Option D weakens the argument because it suggests that the company was already vulnerable to embezzlement before the crime took place.
  Option E does not weaken the argument because it suggests that the actuaries may have had less access to the records than the accountants, which supports the idea that the embezzler is an actuary.

  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A describes a situation where Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. If Riley could not have reasonably foreseen the accident, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B describes a situation where Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother to take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt. If Oblicek could not have reasonably foreseen the bankruptcy, she should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C describes a situation where Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill. However, the principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. Since Gougon was concerned that the sauce might make his guests ill, he could have reasonably foreseen it. Therefore, he should be blamed for it.
  Choice D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. If Dr. Fitzpatrick could not have reasonably foreseen the increase in blood pressure, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice E describes a situation where Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which started a fire on Rodriguez's farm. Since any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire, Kapp should be blamed for it.
  Therefore, the reasoning in choice B is most justified by the principle given.

  The principle states that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  Choice A describes a situation where Riley did not think about the consequences of parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, so if a traffic accident does result from it, he should not be blamed for it.
  Choice B describes a situation where Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother to take out a loan to expand his business would cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
  Choice C describes a situation where Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it.
  Choice D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E describes a situation where Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that it would start a fire. Thus, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.

The university president believes that research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life.
A: The research is not related to practical concerns, so the principle does not apply here.
B: The research is in astrophysics and does not relate to practical problems that affect people's quality of life, so the principle does not apply here.
C: The research position involves managing grant applications and does not relate to practical problems that affect people's quality of life, so the principle does not apply here.

The principle states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A: The argument talks about a legitimate offer and an acceptance. The principle does not apply here.
Option B: The argument talks about an offer made in jest. The principle applies here.
Option C: The argument talks about a legitimate offer and a reasonable person's acceptance. The principle does not apply here.
Option D: The argument talks about an offer made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. The principle applies here.
Option E: The argument talks about Sal's offer not being legitimate. The principle does not apply here.

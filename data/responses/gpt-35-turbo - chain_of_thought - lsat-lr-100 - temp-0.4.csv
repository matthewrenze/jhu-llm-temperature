  The biologist argues that the critics are wrong to doubt the study's results because the author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years.
  However, the argument does not address the small sample size of the study.
  The argument also does not provide evidence to support the conclusion that the behavior of six individual chameleons can be generalized to lizards as a whole.
  Therefore, the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it fails to address the small sample size of the study.
  The answer is not C or D because the argument does not focus its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself, nor does it fail to demonstrate that the study's critics have relevant expertise.
  The answer is not E because the argument does not hold the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics.
  The answer is not B because the argument does not fail to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun.

  Option D is consistent with the professor's argument, as it reflects the idea that heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.
  Option E is incorrect because the professor does not make any claims about other forms of poetry.

  The argument is based on a survey of new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders who reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism if:
    - Some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
    - The new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time.
    - Switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka.
    - Few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
    - People capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders.

  The argument is that the viewers who thought that Lopez made the better arguments may have been biased in favor of Lopez since Lopez eventually won the election.
  To undermine the argument, we need to show that the viewers who thought that Lopez made the better arguments were not biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option B does not undermine the argument since the argument is about the viewers who watched the televised debate, not the live audience.
  Option C is irrelevant to the argument.
  Option D strengthens the argument since it suggests that the viewers who thought that Lopez made the better arguments were biased in favor of Lopez.
  Option E does not undermine the argument since it does not provide any information about the bias of the viewers who thought that Lopez made the better arguments.

  The argument states that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists because more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because it doesn't consider other factors that could affect the safety of bicyclists such as the seriousness of injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes, the number of bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes, and the assumption that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.
  Choice A addresses the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.

If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.

  Option A presents a similar dilemma where taking vitamin E supplements may reduce the risk of heart attack but it has not been established that it is safe for all people.
  Therefore, recommending everyone to take vitamin E supplements should not be done.
  Option B presents a similar situation where taxing tobacco heavily generates revenue for education but if taxes become too high, people might smoke less, reducing the funding generated for education.
  Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  Option C presents a similar situation where limiting purchases to what one needs and saving or investing any remaining income is better for the consumer.

  The argument states that high-fiber diets prevent colon cancer and low-fiber diets cause it.
  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to colon cancer.
  It is possible that other factors, besides fiber consumption, may also contribute to colon cancer.
  The question asks for the possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B may be true, but it does not address the argument's conclusion directly.
  Choice C may be true, but it does not address the argument's conclusion directly.
  Choice D may be true, but it does not address the argument's conclusion directly.
  Choice E is a possible criticism of the argument because it suggests that other substances in fiber-rich foods, not just fiber, may be responsible for preventing colon cancer.

  Brown dwarfs are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres.
  Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete.
  Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed.
  A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed.
  The statements suggest that lithium is a marker for identifying celestial objects.
  The statements also suggest that the presence or absence of lithium in the atmosphere of a celestial object is related to the mass of the object and the completeness of the mixing of elements in its internal nuclear furnace.

  Answer choice D is somewhat related, but it is not the most relevant because the biologist is not arguing that the perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices.
  Answer choice E is the most relevant because it supports the biologist's argument that there is at least one species of fish that had six phalanges in its fins, which strengthens the argument that humans could have descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand.

  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to find a statement that helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Option A is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option B talks about the profits of owners of movie theaters, not the goals of movie executives.
  Option C is not relevant to the goals of the executives.
  Option D talks about the profits of television shows, not the goals of television executives.
  Option E suggests that the most popular television shows are free to watch.
  If the most popular television shows are free to watch, then the goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers but to maximize the number of viewers that advertisers are willing to pay to reach.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch.

  Choice C: Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill but had no reason to think that it would. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should not be blamed for it.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine without knowing that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves without realizing that it could start a fire. However, any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Therefore, Kapp is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm.

  The passage talks about the evolution of the human brain and the food resources that supported it.
  The conflict is that the food resources that could support the high-calorie diet providing adequate fats were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments, but the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find an option that explains why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, despite the abundant and reliable food resources in shore environments.
  Option A talks about the metabolic rate of early humans, which is irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option B talks about the size of the earliest known human brain, which is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option C talks about the reliability and abundance of resources in prehistoric savanna and woodland areas, which does not explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in those areas.
  Option D talks about the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, which is also irrelevant to the conflict.
  Option E explains that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments, which could be a reason why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas, despite the abundant and reliable food resources in shore environments.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  The statement mentions that a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain.
  The statement also mentions that food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, there is an apparent conflict between the two statements.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to find a statement that would explain why the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas despite the availability of abundant and reliable food resources in shore environments.

The principle stated above states that an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option A: The argument talks about a legitimate offer that was not rejected. It does not mention anything about the offer being made in jest. This option is not relevant to the principle stated.
Option B: The argument talks about an offer made in jest, which is not a legitimate offer. This option is relevant to the principle stated.
Option C: The argument talks about a legitimate offer, but it does not mention anything about whether the offer was made in jest or not. This option is not relevant to the principle stated.
Option D: The argument talks about an offer that was not made in jest and was legitimate. This option is not relevant to the principle stated.
Option E: The argument talks about an offer that is not legitimate. It does not mention anything about whether the offer was made in jest or not. This option is not relevant to the principle stated.

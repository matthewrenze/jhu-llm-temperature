  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study was conducted on blindfolded volunteers who tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola.
  The advertisement does not provide any information on the sample size or the representativeness of the sample.
  The advertisement does not provide any information on the methodology of the study or the criteria used to determine preference.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference for Sparkle Cola is due to its taste and not other factors such as price or packaging.
  The advertisement overlooks the possibility that other colas not tested in the study may have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  Therefore, the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.

  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing colas tasted.
  The study was carefully controlled and blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups.
  The advertisement assumes that the preference of the volunteers will translate to a more favorable response from consumers.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the basis that it overlooks other possibilities that may have influenced the results of the study.
  Option A addresses the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups. This is not the most vulnerable criticism.
  Option B addresses the assumption that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted. This is not the most vulnerable criticism.
  Option C addresses the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. This is not the most vulnerable criticism.
  Option D addresses the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste. This is a valid criticism as the study does not take into account other factors that may influence consumer preference.

  We need to find a reason that explains why the new highway caused an increase in average commute time.
  Option A does not explain why the new highway caused an increase in average commute time.
  Option B suggests that the new highway is being used by people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs, which could mean that more people are using the highway to commute to downtown Gastner, causing an increase in average commute time.
  Option C suggests that the new stoplights on the suburban roads could be causing traffic congestion on the new highway, which could be causing an increase in average commute time.
  Option D suggests that the road repair work on important streets leading to downtown Gastner could be causing an increase in average commute time.
  Option E suggests that the traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened, which could be causing an increase in average commute time.

The professor states that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures presented as role models, which gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems. 
Option A is too broad and does not specifically relate to the transmission of values through poetry. 
Option B accurately restates the professor's claim that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. 
Option C is partially correct in that values are not always explicitly set forth in poetry, but it is not necessarily rare. 
Option D is an accurate restatement of the professor's claim that heroic figures embody the values by which people are to live. 
Option E is incorrect because the professor did not state that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.

  The professor argues that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values through heroic figures as role models.
  Therefore, it must be true that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
  Other forms of poetry may also give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it, but the professor's argument is specifically about epic poetry.
  The professor also suggests that values are embodied in heroic figures rather than set forth explicitly.
  Finally, the professor's argument implies that for many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.

  The professor claims that the most important function of epic poetry is to transmit values by embodying them in heroic figures.
  The professor also claims that imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  Therefore, the answer must be a statement that reflects the professor's claims.
  Choice A is too broad and not specific to the professor's claims.
  Choice C is not necessarily true since some poetry does explicitly discuss values.

If customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, it could suggest that the sale has already attracted customers who needed a hammer. Therefore, the customers who visited the store last week to buy a hammer would have already bought the Maxlast hammers on sale. This could cause a shift in the demand towards the Styron hammers.

  We need to find an option that explains why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option A is irrelevant as it talks about the first several seconds after shoppers enter a store and not about the sale of hammers.
  Option B is also irrelevant as it talks about what attracts most of the hardware store's customers, and not about the sale of hammers.
  Option C is irrelevant as it talks about customers who bought Maxlast hammers last week and not about the current sale of hammers.
  Option D explains that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. This can explain why the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers as the flyers may have attracted customers to the store, but they may have purchased the Styron hammers instead because they were not on sale.
  Option E is irrelevant as it talks about a single item on sale and not about the sale of hammers.

  If the sale price of the Maxlast hammers was not attractive enough, shoppers would not have bought them.
  Choice E explains that a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store.
  Therefore, it is likely that the shoppers who bought the Maxlast hammers were already in the store for some other reason and noticed the sale while they were there. On the other hand, the shoppers who bought the Styron hammers were not motivated by the sale and bought the Styron hammers because they preferred them over the Maxlast hammers.

  The argument states that Wilson Appliance's product accounts for only 25% of sales of hair dryers nationwide.
  The argument also states that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  The argument concludes that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  The argument assumes that the only change in the company's net income comes from the decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer.

  Therefore, the flaw in the editorialist's argument is that it confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim.

  The argument is vulnerable to criticism because the conclusion is based on a correlation between bicycle lanes and accidents, but correlation does not necessarily imply causation.
  Answer choice A is irrelevant because the argument is not concerned with the severity of injuries sustained by bicyclists.

  Option A talks about the benefits of taking vitamin E supplements to reduce the risk of heart attack, but it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. Therefore, it should not be recommended that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day.
  Option B talks about the government's right to tax tobacco heavily and spend the revenue on education. However, if these taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. Therefore, such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue.
  Option C talks about how a consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. However, if everyone did this, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. Therefore, we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
  Option D talks about how legislators would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected if they spent less time campaigning. However, if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. Therefore, it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning.
  Option E talks about how restricting land development in wilderness areas helps preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas.

  The study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  The question asks for the choice that most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study.
  Choice A doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  Choice B doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  Choice C explains why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking. If most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities, it would explain why the level of nicotine in the blood of smokers is the same at the end of a day's worth of smoking, regardless of the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke.
  Choice D doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.
  Choice E doesn't explain why the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking.

  The argument does not consider other factors that may contribute to the incidence of colon cancer.
  Choice B suggests that there may be other types of cancer that are reduced by high-fther diets, but this does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice C suggests that fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets, but this does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice D suggests that the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees, but this does not address the argument's reasoning.
  Choice E suggests that foods containing fther also contain other substances that tend to prevent colon cancer, which could be a factor in the studies mentioned in the argument.
  Therefore, the answer is E: foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer.

Option A: Riley did not realize that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle.
Option B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principle.
Option C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill but had no reason to think that it would. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it. This does not align with the principle.
Option D: Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine and did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it. This does not align with the principle.
Option E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, and any reasonable person could have foreseen that it would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm. This does not align with the principle.
Therefore, the answer is B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.

  The conflict is that the high-calorie diet that supported the evolution of the human brain was available in shore environments, but the evolution took place in savanna and woodland areas.
  To resolve the conflict, we need to know why the evolution of the human brain took place in savanna and woodland areas rather than shore environments.
  Choice A is not relevant to the conflict.

This option relates to the principle stated above, as the offer was not legitimate because someone in Kenta's position would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest.
Option C states that Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. This option does not relate to the principle stated above.
Option D states that Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. This option relates to the principle stated above, as the offer was legitimate because no one in Lea's position would reasonably believe it to be made in jest.
Option E states that the only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. This option does not relate to the principle stated above.

  The argument states that most of the sociology majors are taking the class, but most of the psychology majors are not.

  This conclusion assumes that the people who did not respond to the poll have the same preferences as those who did, which is not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents, more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks.

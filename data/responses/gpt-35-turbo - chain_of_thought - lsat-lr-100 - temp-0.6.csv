  The argument is that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is needed to be certain of the identity of the polluter.
  Choice A states that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before imposing the penalty.
  Choice A aligns with the argument and helps to justify the reasoning in the argument.

  The argument is based on the premise that the penalty for the pollution is severe.
  The argument concludes that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the argument is concerned with the appropriate conditions under which a penalty can be imposed.
  Choice A captures the principle that the more severe the penalty is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.

The argument states that the penalty for pollution is severe.
It also states that stronger evidence or admission of responsibility is required to impose the penalty.
The reasoning seems to be based on the principle that the penalty should not be imposed unless there is sufficient evidence.
Option A is similar to this principle.
Option B seems to address the severity of the penalty, but it does not directly address the issue of evidence.
Option C is about the proportionality of the penalty to the harm caused, which is not the main concern in the argument.
Option D is about admitting responsibility, which is not directly relevant to the argument.
Option E is also about the severity of the penalty and certainty of guilt, but it is not as directly related to the argument as option A.

  Thus, the principle that supports the reasoning in the argument is that the more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
  This is because severe penalties should only be imposed when there is sufficient evidence to ensure that the party is guilty.

  The professor's statement is about the most important function of epic poetry.
  The function is to transmit values by which a group of people is to live.
  The transmission is accomplished by embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models.
  Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems.
  The question is asking which statement must also be true based on the professor's statements.
  From the professor's statements, it can be concluded that epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.

The argument of the ethicist is about when we are justified in praising or blaming a person for an action. 
The ethicist is rejecting Tolstoy's claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
The correct answer choice should provide a premise that enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn. 
Option A is not helpful because it is too extreme. 
Option B is a restatement of the argument rather than a premise. 
Option C is too narrow. 
Option D is also too narrow and does not state a premise that enables the conclusion.

  The ethicist argues that we need to know a lot about the events leading up to an action to justify praising or blaming a person.
  The ethicist also rejects Tolstoy's claim that knowing a lot about the events leading up to any action would make us cease to regard that action as freely performed.
  The argument assumes that such a claim is incorrect.
  Therefore, the correct answer must show that the claim is false.
  Option A suggests that people should not be held responsible for actions caused by conditions beyond their control.
  Option B suggests that the amount of information available to others does not determine whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible.
  Option C suggests that we can be justified in blaming or praising a person only when we regard that action as freely performed.
  Option D suggests that the responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree, but our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available.
  Option E suggests that we will regard an action as freely performed only if we do not know much about the events leading up to it.
  Option B is the best answer because it provides a clear reason for rejecting Tolstoy's claim.

The argument concludes that adding bicycle lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists based on the fact that statistics reveal more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
This conclusion is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it does not consider other factors that might affect the safety of bicyclists.
Option A presents a possible criticism that the argument overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes.
Option B is not a valid criticism since the argument is based on statistics that compare the number of collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles on roads with and without bicycle lanes.
Option C is not a valid criticism since the argument does not assume that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists.

The argument mentions that a diet based on fish protein is healthier than one based on red meat. However, if everyone were to adopt this diet, it would cause the extinction of many marine species. Therefore, this diet should not be recommended for universal adoption.
Option A is similar to the argument above in that it mentions that a vitamin E supplement can reduce the risk of heart attack. However, since it is not conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people, they should not be recommended for universal adoption.
Option B talks about the taxation of tobacco and spending the revenue on education. However, if the taxes become too high, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue. This argument does not resemble the argument above.

Option D mentions that if legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. However, if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. This argument does not resemble the argument above.
Option E talks about restricting land development in wilderness areas to preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. However, this would reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas.

The argument claims that considering H pylori as a commensal is misguided because it can cause stomach ulcers in some people, even though it allegedly strengthens the immune response.
The argument then compares H pylori to M tuberculosis, which can cause tuberculosis in some people, without being called a commensal.
To undermine the argument's reasoning, we need to show that the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis is flawed.
If we can show that M tuberculosis is more like H pylori than the argument suggests, then the argument's reasoning that H pylori should not be considered a commensal is weakened.

  Choice E is a plausible alternative explanation because it suggests that the protective effect of fiber may be due to other substances in fiber-rich foods, not just fiber itself.

  The argument claims that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  The argument provides evidence to support the claim by citing studies that show a negative correlation between high-fiber diets and the incidence of colon cancer.
  The question asks to identify a possibility that the argument overlooks.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument as it doesn't address the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice B is also irrelevant as the argument only discusses the relationship between fiber and colon cancer.
  Choice C is also irrelevant as the argument assumes that sufficient consumption of fiber prevents colon cancer, not whether it is difficult to include in one's diet.
  Choice D is also irrelevant as the argument only claims that fiber prevents colon cancer, not how much fiber is needed to prevent it.

  The government official argues that foreign citizens can be public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries.
  This is because some duties of cabinet secretaries should be performed only by citizens.
  Cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, if a foreign citizen is appointed as cabinet secretary, then the duties of the secretary that should be performed by citizens will not be performed properly.
  The most logical completion of the government official's statement would be an argument that supports the idea that cabinet secretaries should be citizens.
  Therefore, the answer is D: foreign citizens should not be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries.

  The principles state that a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
  For each choice, we need to determine if the person knowingly or unwittingly brought about misfortune and if they could have reasonably foreseen it.
  Choice A: Riley knowingly parked his car in the center lane of Main Street, but he did not foresee that it could lead to a traffic accident. Therefore, if a traffic accident does result, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principles above.
  Choice B: Oblicek unwittingly suggested to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business, and she could not have reasonably foreseen that it would cause the business to go bankrupt. Therefore, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, she should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principles above.
  Choice C: Gougon was concerned that serving the hollandaise sauce might make his guests ill, but he had no reason to think it would. Therefore, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, he should not be blamed for it. This aligns with the principles above.
  Choice D: Dr. Fitzpatrick unwittingly gave his patient the wrong medicine, and he did not know it would cause the patient to have greatly increased blood pressure. Therefore, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it. This aligns with the principles above.
  Choice E: Kapp dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves, which any reasonable person could have foreseen would start a fire. Therefore, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm. This does NOT align with the principles above.
  
The valid principle that justifies the reasoning above is B: Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.

  The passage states that the antidote is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
  The passage also states that researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous.
  Therefore, there is an apparent discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the warning of the researchers.
  To reconcile this discrepancy, we need to identify a reason why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  Choice A, B, and D do not provide a reason why the drug could be dangerous.
  Choice E suggests that the use of the drug could contribute to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, but this is not mentioned in the passage.
  Choice C provides a reason why the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous, as it does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person.

  The assumption required by the argument is that the use of a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers will result in cleaner clothes in front-loading washers than using ordinary powder detergent.
  Choice B talks about the dissolution of detergent in washers, but it does not address the effectiveness of the detergent in cleaning clothes.
  Choice C states that a washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine, but this is too broad and not specific to the argument.
  Choice D states that a laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it, which is true, but it does not address the effectiveness of the detergent in front-loading washers.
  Choice E talks about the relationship between the amount of water used in washers and the cleanliness of clothes, but this is not relevant to the argument.
  Therefore, the assumption required by the argument is that a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers is more effective in cleaning clothes in front-loading washers than ordinary powder detergent.
  The answer is B: A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers.

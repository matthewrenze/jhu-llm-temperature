  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  It is not clear if a generalization based on the entire group of volunteers is also true for each of the five smaller groups.
  Therefore, the advertisement is vulnerable to criticism on the ground that it overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.

  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The study involved blindfolded volunteers divided evenly into five groups.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism if it overlooks an important possibility that could have affected the result.
  Option A suggests that the study may not have accounted for the difference between the responses of the five smaller groups.
  Option B raises the issue of cost, which is not addressed in the advertisement.
  Option C suggests that the study may not have considered other types of cola that were not tested.
  Option D points out that Sparkle Cola may have been preferred for reasons other than taste.
  Option E is not relevant to the reasoning presented in the advertisement.
  Thus, the best answer is D: It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola rather than its taste.

  The advertisement claims that most of the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted.
  The advertisement bases this claim on a study that divided the participants into five groups and gave each group a different cola to taste.
  The advertisement assumes that this study is good evidence that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  One of the choices must be a weakness in the advertisement's reasoning.
  (A) is a weak choice. The study was controlled, and the participants were randomly assigned to groups. It is unlikely that the results from one group would skew the results from another group.
  (B) is a weak choice. The advertisement does not claim that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola; it only claims that they preferred it in the taste test.
  (C) is a strong choice. The advertisement only tested five colas and assumes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. It is possible that some cola not tested would have been preferred by the volunteers.
  (D) is a strong choice. The advertisement assumes that the taste test is the only reason why the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola. There could be other reasons why people prefer Sparkle Cola over the competing colas.
  (E) is a weak choice. The fact that the study only tested colas does not make the advertisement's reasoning vulnerable to criticism.

  The advertisement claims that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The advertisement arrived at this conclusion from a study that divided the volunteers evenly into five groups, with each group tasting Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas.
  The criticism that the reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to is that it overlooks the possibility of a confounding variable affecting the volunteers' preferences.
  If the volunteers preferred Sparkle Cola over the other colas due to reasons other than taste, the conclusion that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested would not be valid.

  Each group tasted a different cola.
  The criticism is regarding the vulnerability of the study's reasoning.
  A generalization true of the entire group of volunteers may not be true of each of the five smaller groups.
  The study doesn't address whether volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola over other colas tested in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive.
  The study doesn't address the possibility that other colas were not tested, which may have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  The study doesn't address the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola to other colas for reasons such as packaging or price, rather than taste.

  The study divides all volunteers into five groups, with each group tasting a different cola.
  The advertisement implies that the result of the study is true for all volunteers.
  However, there are some other possibilities that are not considered in the advertisement, such as the possibility that:
  - a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
  - some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola.
  - many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste.
  Option A, B, C, and D point out some of these possibilities.
  Option E is irrelevant to the argument presented in the advertisement.
  Among those four options, option D seems to be the most reasonable criticism because it points out that the study result may not be because Sparkle Cola tastes better, but because of other factors like its packaging or price.

The professor argues that epic poetry functions as a way to transmit values of a group of people through heroic figures that are presented as role models. The transmission of values is implicit and achieved by imitating those role models. This implies that the correct statement must align with this argument.
Action: Answer(""B"")

The professor's statements suggest that:
  - Epic poetry has a function to transmit values of a group of people.
  - It is done through presenting heroic figures as role models.
  - The role models give meaning and direction to the lives of people who hear the poems.
  - The values are not presented explicitly.
If these are true, then:
  - (A) can be inferred from the given statements, as it is implied that poetry can give meaning and direction to people's lives.
  - (B) is a direct statement from the given statements.
  - (C) is also true, as it is mentioned that values are not set forth explicitly.
  - (D) is a logical conclusion when we combine the given statements.
  - (E) is not true as the professor has not made a statement that only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models.
Therefore, the answer is (D): For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live.

The argument in the advertisement relies on the survey taken by a sample of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders.
The survey results are reported to have saved $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
The argument assumes most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka.
The argument could be criticized on several grounds.
Option A is not a weakness of the argument because the argument only states that a representative sample was surveyed, and does not claim that all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders saved money.
Option B is not a weakness of the argument because the argument does not make any assumptions about how much people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time pay for their auto insurance.
Option C is not a weakness of the argument because the argument does not compare savings between companies. It only claims that switching to Popelka saves people money on average.

  Option A could explain why shoppers didn't take notice of the Maxlast hammers on sale, but this doesn't explain why the Styron hammers outsold Maxlast.
  Option B suggests that quality and service are more important than low prices, but this doesn't explain why the Styron hammers outsold Maxlast.
  Option C suggests that the sale on Maxlast brand hammers motivated customers to buy, but this doesn't explain why the Styron hammers outsold Maxlast.
  Option D tells us that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, which could have increased the number of customers visiting the store and hence the number of Styron hammers sold. This could explain the surprising result.

  The statement also mentions that Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  We need to find a reason that explains why the Styron hammers would outsell the Maxlast hammers on sale.
  Option C suggests that last week's buyers of Maxlast hammers bought them specifically because of the sale.
  This suggests that people who already needed hammers bought them on sale rather than people buying more than they needed.
  This would explain why the Styron hammers outsold Maxlast hammers, despite the latter being on sale.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time.

  The argument states the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company's sales declined from 50% to 25%.
  This does not necessarily mean a decline in total sales of the Wilson Appliance Company.
  The argument assumes that the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years.
  Lastly, it concludes that Wilson's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.

  The argument claims that the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  This conclusion is based on two premises: the decline in market share of the Wilson Appliance's hair dryer and the unchanged average net income of each hair dryer sold over the last 5 years.
  However, it is not clear whether the total sales of the product have decreased or not.
  Also, it is not mentioned if the company has any other product.
  There is no discussion about the price of the hair dryer over the past 5 years.

  It supports this claim by stating that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes.
  The argument is therefore vulnerable to criticism as follows:
    - It assumes that the injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are less serious, on average, than those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes. This assumption may not be true.
    - It fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes.

  The argument states that a diet based on fish proteins is healthier but may lead to the extinction of marine species if adopted universally.
  Similarly, the argument in option C suggests that limiting purchases to necessities and saving may be beneficial for an individual, but if everyone were to follow this, the economy would be negatively affected.
  Therefore, the answer is C: A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people.

  The argument is that a diet with fish protein is healthier than one with red meat but universal adoption of this diet would lead to extinction of marine species. Therefore, the universal adoption of this diet should not be recommended.
  Choice A is about not recommending vitamin E supplements every day because of safety concerns.
  Choice B is about taxing tobacco heavily and how high taxes might reduce funding for education.
  Choice C is about limiting purchases to what people need but universal adoption of this spending pattern would lead to a severe recession.
  Choice D is about how legislators spend their time campaigning and how that affects their reelection.
  Choice E is about restricting land development in wilderness areas and how that affects the proliferation of species.
  None of the arguments seems to closely resemble the reasoning in the argument above.

The argument suggests that adopting a healthier diet based on fish protein will lead to the extinction of marine species that it is based on.
Hence, adopting such a diet universally is not recommended.
Option A presents evidence that supports the use of vitamin E supplements in reducing the risk of heart attacks. However, it has not been established that such supplements are safe for everyone, so universal recommendations should not be made.
Option B presents the argument that high taxes on tobacco may lead to reduced funding for education generated from such taxes; thus, other sources of revenue might have to be used to supplement such taxes.
Option C presents the argument that limiting purchases to what is truly needed will make consumers better off. But if everyone does this, it will lead to a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible for most people. Thus, this spending pattern should not be recommended to everyone.
Option D is unrelated to the given argument.
Option E presents the argument that restricting land development in wilderness areas can help preserve species that inhabit these areas, but it can also reduce the proliferation of species that flourish in developed areas. Thus, it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.
Option A, B, and C are not similar to the reasoning in the initial argument. Option D is unrelated. Option E presents the argument that there are trade-offs between preserving species in wilderness areas and allowing development, similar to the trade-offs in the initial argument.
Therefore, the answer is E: If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas.

Explanation: 
  Option C (most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities) helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study because it suggests that the amount of nicotine absorbed by the smoker is not dependent on the level of nicotine in the cigarette they smoke, but rather the amount of nicotine delivered to the blood. Thus, even if the smoker chooses to smoke low-nicotine cigarettes, they are likely to smoke more cigarettes to get the same amount of nicotine, maintaining the same level of nicotine in their bloodstream.

  The study found that the level of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes smoked.
  Option A is not helpful in explaining the finding.
  Option B is not relevant because the study is concerned with the levels of nicotine found in smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day, regardless of the nicotine content of the cigarettes they smoke.
  Option D is not relevant to the study since the level of tar is not connected with the finding.

  According to the given context, if grain prices double:
    - the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent
    - the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling.
  In order to explain this phenomenon, we need to find a choice that can justify the difference in the price hike between bread and beef.
  The cost of labor and marketing for bread and the cost of feeding for beef are mentioned in the context; we need to consider a choice that can build on this information.
  Choice B compares wholesale prices rather than retail prices and does not provide any useful justification.
  Choice D discusses the proportion of beef sold in retail markets that are fed on grass. This is irrelevant to the given context.
  Choice A is about labor costs involved in beef production. This does not provide any useful justification for the price difference.
  Choice E discusses the grocery outlets that purchase meat and bread. This is also irrelevant to the given context.
  The only relevant choice is C, which explains that the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef, while the labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost. Therefore, the cost of feeding the cattle is a more significant factor in the cost of beef than the cost of production and selling. Hence, the price hike in grain-fed beef is higher than bread.

  The argument states that there is a correlation between high-fiber diets and low incidence of colon cancer.
  It also mentions that in areas where cereals are consumed less, the colon cancer rate is higher.
  The argument concludes that insufficient consumption of fiber causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fiber prevents it.
  However, the argument may overlook a possibility that weakens the reasoning.
  Option A, the consumption of fiber in many countries is rising appreciably, does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  Option B, the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fiber diets, also does not affect the argument's reasoning.
  Option C, the argument does not address whether fiber is difficult for many people to include in their diets.

The journalist states that:
- Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars.
- Lithium is present in stars that are at least as massive as the Sun and have not completely mixed their elements.
- Stars with less mass than the Sun have completely mixed their elements and do not have lithium in their atmospheres.
- Brown dwarfs do not have a fully functioning nuclear furnace and therefore cannot consume their lithium.

From this information, it can be inferred that:
- Not having lithium in its atmosphere is not enough to identify a celestial object as a brown dwarf, as some stars might also lack lithium.
- The presence of lithium in an object's atmosphere indicates that it has not completely mixed its elements, which appears to be strongly linked to the mass of the object.
- It is possible for an object less massive than a brown dwarf to have lithium in its atmosphere, as long as it has not completely mixed its elements.

  A: This option indicates that the game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers. However, it does not impact the justification of the publisher's prediction.
  B: This option indicates that it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. However, this option does not help to justify the publisher's prediction since time to complete the game does not impact the purchase rate.
  C: This option indicates that the publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market. It could help to justify the publisher's prediction since the publisher's games are already popular, which means more people are likely to purchase them.

Option A introduces a new idea that is not related to the argument.
Option B is in line with the argument but it goes against the official's statement that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels.
Option C is irrelevant to the argument and it does not complete the statement.
Option D contradicts the official's argument and reasons, so it cannot complete the statement.
Option E contradicts the statement that a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as a cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable.

  The argument states that foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels but not as cabinet secretaries, because cabinet secretaries have some duties that can only be performed by citizens. 
  Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as the cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. 
  Therefore, the statement should complement the argument presented without contradicting it.
  Option A is not related to the argument.
  Option B is not a logical conclusion of the argument. 
  Option C is not relevant to the argument.
  Option D contradicts the argument.
  Option E contradicts the argument by proposing that cabinet undersecretaries should not serve as cabinet secretaries.

  The government official argues that only citizens should perform certain duties that are performed by cabinet secretaries.
  Additionally, cabinet undersecretaries are expected to serve as cabinet secretaries when the actual secretary is unavailable.
  Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the official would believe it is unwise to appoint foreign citizens as cabinet secretaries, because their undersecretaries would not be eligible to stand in for them.
  Choice D suggests that foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries, which contradicts the official's argument.

The Figorian Development Commission's position is that Figoria should allow wetland development despite the threat it poses to species that inhabit them. The Figorian Development Commission's position is based on the idea that they have the right to govern natural resources in Figoria, and wetland development might not affect wildlife. 
To support Figorian Development Commission's position, we need to find a principle that supports their idea that Figoria has the right to govern its natural resources regardless of the effects on wildlife.
Option A suggests that national resources should be regulated by international agreements when wildlife is endangered, which contradicts Figorian Development Commission's position.
Option B proposes that the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations, which is not relevant to the argument.
Option C suggests that regulation should only be implemented when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Option D argues that environment regulation must aim to prevent any further environmental damage and cannot allow the different degrees of harm done by different nations. This option contradicts the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Option E suggests it is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources, which does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
Thus, the correct answer is D: Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. This principle supports the Figorian Development Commission's position of allowing wetland development in Figoria without considering the effects on wildlife because other nations have already put their natural resources to commercial use.

The question asks for the principle that justifies the reasoning.
The principle states that a person should not be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it.
Option A describes a situation where Riley did not think about the risk of parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, which led to a traffic accident. Therefore, this option justifies the reasoning.
Option B is similar to Option A, where Oblicek did not know that her suggestion would lead to bankruptcy, and it would be unfair to blame her for it.
Option C states that Gougon was concerned that serving hollandaise sauce could make his guests ill, but he still served it. Therefore, this option goes against the principle and cannot justify the reasoning.
Option D describes a situation where Dr. Fitzpatrick gave the wrong medicine, and he did not know that it would cause increased blood pressure. Therefore, no one else other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it.

   We need to find an option that weakens this conclusion.
   Options A, C, D and E do not weaken the conclusion.
   Option B states that the more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.

  The city leader believes that adopting the new tourism plan would increase the amount of money tourists spend in the city by at least $2 billion and create as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would.
  The city leader believes that it would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city, but this would cost more than adopting the tourism plan.
  Therefore, if true, the city leader's statements provide the most support for the idea that it would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
  The answer is D: It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.

  The passage suggests that anatomically modern humans evolved due to a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats, which was most abundant and reliable in shore environments.
  However, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas.
  The apparent conflict is that the environment where the food resources were most abundant and reliable (shore environments) is not where the human brain's evolution took place.
  To resolve this conflict, we need to find additional information that explains why savanna and woodland areas were preferred for the human brain's evolution.
  Choice B is not relevant to the conflict presented in the passage.
  Choice D is about archaeological techniques and is irrelevant to the conflict presented in the passage.
  Choice A and E are irrelevant to the conflict presented in the passage

  The passage presents a conflict that the evolution of the anatomically modern human brain began among our early human ancestors, who required a high-calorie diet providing adequate fats. The food resources that could support such a diet were available in the shore environments, but the evolution of the human brain took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas. 
  To resolve this conflict, the passage requires additional information that would identify why early humans evolved their brains in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option A provides extra information about the metabolic rate of early humans, which is not related to the conflict.
  Option B also provides extra information about the size of the earliest known human brains, which is not related to the conflict either.
  Option C provides information that prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today. But it does not explain why early humans evolved their brains in savanna and woodland areas.
  Option D is discussing the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, which is not related to the conflict.
  Option E provides an explanation that gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. Therefore, early humans must have evolved their brains in savanna and woodland areas where they had easier and more reliable access to food resources.
  Thus, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

  Option A and B don't address the concern that the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  Option D suggests that the drug could be fatal if misused but the question stem mentions that the drug has no serious side effects, so option D is not relevant.
  Option E suggests that the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, which aligns with the concern that the widespread use of the drug could be dangerous.
  Option C suggests that the drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, which is a concern, but it doesn't really reconcile the discrepancy between the effectiveness of the drug and the danger of its widespread use.
  Therefore, the best option is E, which suggests that the use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug, and thus reconciles the potential danger of the drug's widespread use.

The argument in the consumer magazine says that to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine, a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers should be used. To support this argument, it must be assumed that:
  - There is a difference between the performance of ordinary powder detergent and a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers.
  - The source of the problem is the use of less water in front-loading machines.
  - The use of a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers can solve the problem.
Option A is irrelevant to the argument.
Option B is irrelevant because it does not matter how well a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves in top-loading machines.
Option C is too broad because the argument does not say that any specialized detergent can get clothes really clean in any washing machine.
Option D is the best assumption because the argument states that the ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers.
Option E is irrelevant because the argument does not claim that washers that use less water are better or worse than those that use more water.
Therefore, the answer is D: A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.

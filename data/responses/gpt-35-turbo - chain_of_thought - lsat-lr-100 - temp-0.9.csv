  The advertisement mentions that blindfolded volunteers were divided into five groups, each group tasting a different cola.
  It mentions that most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola.
  The advertisement concludes that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested.
  The reasoning in the advertisement is vulnerable to criticisms on various grounds.
  Option A, Option B, and Option E are not relevant to the argument in the advertisement.
  Option C is possible, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the argument.
  Option D is most relevant to the argument.
  It questions the assertion that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested by pointing out the possibility that people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons other than its taste.

  The argument most similar to this flawed pattern of reasoning is the one that has a flawed causal relationship.
  Choice A seems to present a valid causal relationship; checking the tire pressure regularly will help prevent tire wear out prematurely.
  Choice B presents a causal relationship between tire pressure and wear out, but it seems valid because neglecting to check the pressure regularly is a proven cause of tire wear out.
  Choice C presents a causal relationship between tire wear out and neglecting to check tire pressure regularly, which seems valid. It suggests a solution to avoid tire wear out by making car owners aware of the consequences.
  Choice D presents a causal relationship similar to that in Choice B and also seems valid.
  Choice E presents a flawed causal relationship because it suggests that low tire pressure is the only reason for tire wear out prematurely. However, it is possible for a tire to wear out prematurely due to other reasons like being driven on gravel roads.

  The argument suggests that the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe, that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty.
  Thus, the argument seems to suggest that there must be a higher degree of certainty before imposing a severe penalty.

 The argument is about the certainty of the identity of the polluter before imposing a severe penalty.
 The speaker says that unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, the penalty cannot be imposed.
 We need to find the principle that justifies the reasoning in the argument.
Option A says that the more severe the penalty, the more certain one must be about the guilt.
This principle supports the argument because it emphasizes the importance of being certain before imposing severe penalties. 
Option B is about the balance of penalties to keep them severe enough to deter people but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them. 
Option C talks about proportional punishments to harm caused by the infraction. 
Option D talks about the unlikelihood of someone coming forward to admit responsibility when the penalty is severe. 
Option E, the severity of penalties should not be so great that one can never be sure of guilt to justify punishment. 
The principle that justifies the reasoning in the argument is A since it directly addresses the issue of certainty of guilt and the severity of the penalty.

  The surprising fact is that the Styron hammers sold more than the Maxlast ones, even though the Maxlast hammers were placed in a display case just inside the store entrance and were put on sale.
  Choice A, which says customers entering the store do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise, does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more.
  It is stated that the hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. So, the assumption is that both brands are of similar quality.
  Choice B mentions that most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices, but this does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more than the Maxlast ones during the sale.
  Choice C indicates that customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time, which implies that people were attracted by the sale price rather than the quality. However, this does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more.
  Choice D mentions that the hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers, but this does not explain why the Styron hammers sold more.
  Choice E implies that a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. This raises a possibility that the customers who specifically wanted Maxlast hammers may not have come to the store to buy them. 
  Therefore, choice E does the most to explain the surprising result.

  The Maxlast hammers were on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance. 
  The Styron hammers retained their usual price and location.
  Despite the sale, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  We need to find a plausible reason that explains how the Styron hammers outsold the on-sale Maxlast hammers.
  Option A does not explain how the Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option B suggests that customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices, but this does not directly explain how Styron hammers outsold the Maxlast hammers.
  Option C could potentially explain the lower sale of Maxlast hammers, but it does not explain how the Styron hammers outsold them.
  Option D points out that the store advertised the sale on Maxlast hammers, but it does not explain how the Styron hammers outsold them.
  Option E is a general statement that may or may not apply to this situation.
  If customers intentionally avoided the display of Maxlast hammers because all hammers were on sale and they thought the quality was inferior, it could explain why the Styron hammers outsold them. It is the best explanation among the given options.

The argument states that the decline in market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is the same as the decline in the net income of the company.
The argument further assumes that the net income is directly proportional to market share.
The argument does not discuss other factors such as competition or changes in demand for hair dryers.
Therefore, the argument is flawed.
The correct answer is likely to show how the argument is flawed.

  The argument mentions that Wilson Appliance Company's hair dryer accounted for 50 percent of all hair dryer sales five years ago and now it accounts for 25 percent of sales.
  The argument also mentions that the net income that Wilson Appliance receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, and due to this decline, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago.
  But, the reasoning in the argument is flawed because it does not take into account other important factors that could have led to this decline in net income. It could be possible that the sales of hair dryers have increased overall but the competition has increased, so Wilson Appliance's hair dryer sales declined. The argument also assumes that Wilson Appliance only sells hair dryers, which may not be accurate. Moreover, the argument does not mention that the costs of production and other factors may have changed. Therefore, the argument is flawed.

  The argument states that a fish-based diet is healthier than red-meat-based one, but if everyone were to adopt this diet, most of the marine species would become extinct leading it to be impossible. Therefore, we should not recommend it.
  Thus, the argument is based on the conflict between two desirable outcomes: a healthier diet and the survival of marine species.
  Option C states that it is better to limit purchases to what an individual truly needs and save or invest remaining income, but if everyone did this, it could lead to a severe recession, making saving and investing impossible.

  The passage explains that grain prices double and the price of grain-fed beef almost doubles, but the price of bread only rises between 10 and 15 percent.
  We need to determine the option that explains this phenomenon the best.
  Options A and E are not relevant to the phenomenon.
  Option B is incorrect as it does not explain the phenomenon.
  Option C is partly relevant, as it provides information about the cost of producing bread and beef.
  Option D provides important information about the proportion of beef produced from grass and grain.
  Compared to grass-fed beef, grain-fed beef is more expensive.
  Therefore, an increase in grain prices will increase the cost of feeding cattle, which will increase the price of grain-fed beef.

  Option A is irrelevant. Farmers' efforts to reduce labor costs do not contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon.
  Option C is also irrelevant. Although it provides some context, it does not explain why the price of bread and beef changes differently.
  Option D is relevant because it indicates that most of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grain, and when grain prices double, the production cost of beef rises substantially, leading to an increase in price.

The question is asking which option undermines this reasoning the most.
Option A does not undermine the argument's reasoning, since the effectiveness of antibiotics does not speak to whether or not H pylori should be considered a commensal or pathogen.
Option B compares the duration of the diseases, and this does not weaken the argument's reasoning.
Option D and E provide information about the number of people who harbor each bacterium, but this also does not affect the argument's reasoning.
Option C, however, directly challenges the argument's claim that only pathogens cause harm and commensals provide benefits. It states that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. If this is true, then it suggests that not all bacteria that live within our bodies provide benefits and some, like M tuberculosis, are simply harmful.

  There might be some alternate explanations for the polar bear finding its way home.
  Option A, where the polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory, does not necessarily prove or disprove the naturalists' claim.
  Option B, where the site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route, does not disprove the naturalists' claim.

  Justifying the prediction means finding a statement that aligns with the prediction.
  Now, the game's rentals are exceeding expectations, so people are paying to rent it to play.
  A statement that could justify the prediction would be something that indicates why people would move from renting to purchasing the game.
  Option B does not help to justify the prediction because it does not indicate the relationship between rentals and purchase.
  Option C does not help to justify the prediction because it talks about the general popularity of the publisher's games, but not the specific game in question.
  Option D is irrelevant since the prediction deals with sales, not post-game usage.

  The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game.
  Rentals are exceeding expectations.
  If the rate of sales is expected to soon exceed expectations, it must be that many renters are choosing to purchase the game.
  Therefore, the justification for the publisher's prediction must address why renters are buying the game.

Action: Answer(""B"") 

Justification:
  If it takes several weeks for most players to complete the game, renters will have to spend more money than the cost of one rental if they want to complete the game by renting only. This will encourage many renters to purchase the game. As a result, the sales of the game may increase substantially. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.

  Which of the statements would, if true, justify the publisher's prediction that sales would soon exceed expectations?
Action: Answer(""B"")  
Explanation: 
  The correct answer is B because if it takes most players several weeks to complete the game, many people will still have the game when the two-day rental period is up. Therefore, they would have to choose between renting the game again or purchasing the game to take advantage of the rebate.

  Option B concludes that because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. However, this conclusion may not be true because it is possible that the workers promised not to strike for other reasons besides thinking the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut.
  Option C concludes that the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries because the stock price did not increase in that time. However, this conclusion is not necessarily true because there could be other reasons why the stock price did not increase. 
  Out of all the options, option B has reasoning that is most similar to the flawed reasoning in the argument above. 
  Hence, the answer is B: Many people fear that if the opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike.

  The Figorian Wildlife Commission's position is to regulate development to protect wildlife by offsetting development with the construction of replacement wetland habitats.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is to allow development as it is necessary for growth and it is their right to govern their own resources.
  The Figorian Development Commission's position is against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position.
  The question asks to find a principle that would strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position.
  Choice A talks about regulating national resources through international agreements when wildlife is endangered. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position as it talks about regulating national resources.
  Choice B talks about the right of future generations to have wildlife preserved over the economic needs of individual nations. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position as it prioritizes wildlife preservation over the economic needs of a nation.
  Choice C talks about regulating development only when a reduction in populations of endangered species have been found. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position as it only regulates development when there is a reduction of populations of endangered species.
  Choice D talks about preventing any further environmental damage and not accounting for different degrees of harm different nations have caused. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position as they are advocating for development.
  Choice E talks about not allowing any further depletion of natural resources. This does not support the Figorian Development Commission's position as they are advocating for development.

  Option B is too extreme as it suggests that only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used.
  Option C is too general and goes beyond the argument's scope.
  Option D puts too much emphasis on parsley, and it does not provide the principle that most clearly helps to justify the argument.
  Option E most clearly helps justify the argument by stating that in cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.
Therefore, the answer is E: In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients.

The argument is that dried parsley should never be used in cooking because it is less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley. 
The principle that would justify this argument is one that says that in cooking, fresh ingredients are generally better than dried ingredients, which lends itself to the conclusion that dried parsley should not be used at all. 
This principle is most closely reflected in Choice E in the options, which reads ""In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients"".

  The detective argues that the embezzler is likely one of the actuaries because an accountant would not have made mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement.
  The correct answer choice is the one that does not weaken the detective's argument.
  Option A - If the actuaries' activities were more closely scrutinized, the detective's argument is further strengthened because it is less likely that an actuary would have been able to engage in such illegal activities undetected.
  Option B - If persons outside XYZ Corporation had access to the internal financial records, then it weakens the detective's argument because the embezzler could have been anyone with access to the records.
  Option C - If there are more accountants than actuaries at XYZ Corporation, then it weakens the detective's argument because it is more likely that the embezzler was an accountant.
  Option D - An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. This does not weaken the detective's argument because the existence of such a report doesn't point to any particular individual.
  Option E - If there were certain security measures that made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to the internal financial records, then it weakens the detective's argument because it is less likely that one of the actuaries would have been the embezzler.

- We need to find the option that does not weaken the argument of the detective.
- The detective is assuming that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary, and since the mistakes in ledger entries were made, accountant is less likely to be the embezzler.
- Option A doesn't weaken the detective's argument. Instead, it supports his argument by mentioning that the activities of the actuaries were more scrutinized than the activities of the accountants. 
- Option B weakens the argument by stating that there is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records. This means that the embezzler could have been an outsider, which weakens the detective's argument. 
- Option C weakens the argument by stating that there are more accountants than actuaries. This means there is a higher probability that the embezzler was one of the accountants. 
- Option D mentions an independent report that concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. However, this may not have any effect on the detective's argument and may rather be a piece of additional information. 
- Option E weakens the argument by saying that certain security measures made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants. If the security measures made it more difficult for actuaries to access financial records, then it's less likely that the embezzler was an actuary, which weakens the detective's argument.

  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see their film to generate revenues from ticket sales.
  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  We need to select the choice that explains the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives.
  Choice A does not explain the difference between the goals.
  Choice B is about movie theaters making large profits selling refreshments, which is not relevant to the goals of movie and television executives.
  Choice C does not explain the difference between the goals.
  Choice D provides a plausible reason for why television executives are not primarily focused on maximizing the number of viewers for their shows.

  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film.

  The primary goal of television executives is not to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  The goal of television executives is not the same as that of movie executives.
  We need to choose an option that provides a plausible reason for this difference in goals.
  
A: The fact that more people are willing to see a film again does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives. Incorrect.
B: The fact that movie theaters make large profits selling refreshments is not relevant to the difference in goals between movie executives and television executives. Incorrect.
C: The fact that the cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than that of producing an hour of television does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives. Incorrect.
D: The fact that television shows make their profits from sponsors who are concerned with the purchasing power of the viewers supports the idea that the primary goal of television executives is to create shows that attract a targeted audience with a high purchasing power, which is not necessarily the same as maximizing the number of viewers. Correct.
E: The fact that over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch does not explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives. Incorrect.

  The primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film, while it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows.
  Choice A suggests that a film can generate more revenues compared to a television show even if a person sees the film more than once. However, this does not explain why a film's success is determined by the number of people who see it, while the number of people who watch a television show is not the primary goal.
  Choice B suggests that owners of movie theaters make large profits by selling refreshments to their customers, while there is no analog to this in television. However, this does not explain why a film's success is determined by the number of people who see it, while the number of people who watch a television show is not the primary goal.
  Choice C suggests that the cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the cost of producing an hour of television. However, this does not explain why a film's success is determined by the number of people who see it, while the number of people who watch a television show is not the primary goal.
  Choice D suggests that television shows make their profits from sponsors who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. This suggests that the primary goal of television executives is to appeal to sponsors by attracting viewers with purchasing power. This helps explain why the number of viewers is not the primary goal of television executives.
  Choice E suggests that over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. This does not explain why the number of viewers is not the primary goal of television executives.

The statements from the curator reveal information about three categories of works: works on loan from private collectors, works in the museum's permanent collection, and other works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection.
The permanent collection works are all available in print in the museum store.
Some works not in the permanent collection are also available in print in the store, such as Hopper's Nighthawks.
From this, we can conclude that some prints in the museum store are of works that are not currently displayed in the museum.
Option A implies that every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. However, we know that some prints are of works not in either of these categories, so this cannot be true.
Option B makes a claim about every print that is sold in the museum store, not just those related to this museum. The information in the question stem only tells us about prints available in this museum's store, so this statement cannot be inferred.
Option C suggests that prints in the museum store correspond exactly to works currently displayed in the museum and not on loan from private collectors. The information in the question stem does not allow us to draw this conclusion.
Option D is incorrect because the question stem does not give us sufficient information to determine whether Hopper's Nighthawks is on loan from a private collector.
Option E is also incorrect. Hopper's Nighthawks may or may not be displayed in the museum, but we cannot determine this from the information given.

  The argument claims that trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues because people with specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries.
  The question asks which of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument.
  If there is a way to include people with specialized knowledge in juries, the argument will be weakened.
  Therefore, let's look at each choice to determine which one weakens the argument the most.
  
  A: This choice supports the argument rather than weaken it. If the issue is too complicated for the juror to understand, this will make it even harder to settle disputes involving scientific or technical issues by jury.
  
  B: This choice also supports the argument rather than weaken it. If having specialized knowledge leads to prejudice, then trials by jury are not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  
  C: This choice is not relevant to the argument. It talks about arbitrators, not juries.
  
  D: This choice is also not relevant to the argument. It talks about experts' testimony, but it does not address the issue of whether juries are a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues.
  
  E: This choice weakens the argument by suggesting that the reason people with specialized knowledge are systematically excluded from juries is not because of a bias against them, but because their fees are too high for many people involved in litigation to afford. If cost is the main issue, then one can argue that including these experts in juries is a feasible solution.

The argument is that people with specialized scientific or technical knowledge are excluded from juries, which makes it unfair to settle disputes involving those issues by jury trials.
Option A seems to support the argument, and Option C is irrelevant to the argument about jury trials.
Option B may support the argument if it is more likely that a juror with knowledge about a technical issue will be prejudiced. Then, the exclusion of jurors with specialized technical knowledge may prevent such prejudice.
Option D may also support the argument if it suggests that expert witnesses are biased or unreliable.
Option E is also irrelevant to the argument about jury trials.
Therefore, the answer is B: The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. It weakens the argument because it suggests that excluding jurors with specialized knowledge may actually prevent prejudice and ensure a fair trial.

  Option D explains the techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites, but it is not relevant to the conflict.
  Option E explains that gathering food in shore environments required more calories by early humans. If that is true, then early humans might not have evolved their brain in shore environments because they might not have been able to get as much food as they could get in savanna and woodland areas.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Gathering food in shore environments required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments.

The passage explains how early humans required a high-calorie diet to support their brain evolution. However, it also presents a conflict that the evolution of the human brain took place primarily in savanna and woodland areas, where food resources were not as favorable as shore environments. To determine which of the following would resolve the apparent conflict, we need to find the statement that would most likely explain why the human brain's evolution occurred in savanna and woodland areas. 
Option A doesn't provide any explanation regarding the evolution process and only provides information about the metabolic rate that would make a slight impact. 
Option B isn't relevant as it deals with the size of the brain rather than the evolution process. 
Option C is not significant to explain the process of evolution. 
Option D is irrelevant to the subject of the argument. 
Option E suggests that gathering food in the shore environments required significantly more calories, and therefore, humans evolved in savanna and woodland areas with easier food sources, allowing their metabolic energy to be directed towards the evolution of the brain.

The question asks for the option that reconciles the discrepancy that while the antidote for chicken pox is very effective at limiting the duration and severity of the disease, its widespread use could be dangerous. So, we are to find the option that explains why the antidote could be dangerous despite its effectiveness.
Option A does not explain the apparent discrepancy.
Option B does not explain the apparent discrepancy.
Option C is not relevant to the discrepancy.
Option D seems to resolve the apparent discrepancy by suggesting that the drug can be dangerous if misused, despite being effective when taken at the prescribed dose.
Option E contradicts the statement that the antidote is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox.
Therefore, the answer is D: When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal.

  The argument for freedom of thought is that it allows thinkers to pursue their ideas regardless of whom they offend and wherever they lead. However, to make intellectual progress, thinkers need intellectual discipline to mine their ideas' full implications. 
  The conclusion is that freedom of thought fails as an argument.
  The assumption needed to make this conclusion is that freedom of thought is insufficient to ensure intellectual progress because intellectual discipline is necessary.

    The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is not the conclusion of the argument, but rather it is a premise used to support the argument’s conclusion.
    This premise aims to explain why the benefactor needs to know the source of the gratitude and why anonymity undermines the effectiveness of positively reinforcing behaviors that benefit others.
    Therefore, the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument’s conclusion.

  The passage discusses Katherine Dunham's contributions to modern North American dance.
  Dunham introduced the technique of dance-isolation and incorporated traditional techniques from African, Caribbean, and Pacific-island cultures into modern dance.
  Dunham's success is attributed to her training in both anthropological research and choreography.
  Dunham's approach to research diverged from the prevailing methodology at the time, and she was able to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices.
  Dunham developed a research-to-performance method that she used to adapt Caribbean dance forms for use in theatrical performance, combining them with modern dance styles she learned in Chicago.

  The principle is that of utility maximization, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.

  The passage describes a debate between two sides on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals, while the other side believes that the decision to commit a crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle that reconciles the two positions.
  The principle is that of utility maximization, which holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The principle is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The passage concludes that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.
  Therefore, the passage is organized around two sides of a debate that are described and an economic principle that is applied to decide between them.

  Passage B describes how astronomers predicted the existence of Neptune based on the observed orbit of Uranus.
  They used Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions to make their predictions.
  When their predictions were not borne out, they hypothesized the existence of another planet in the vicinity, which they called Neptune.
  Later, Neptune was discovered in the precise place it would have to be to bring their calculations into alignment with their observations.
  Therefore, the scientific episode that is most analogous to the discovery of Neptune is the discovery of a planet based on the observed orbit of another planet.
  The only choice that describes such a discovery is choice A, which describes Galileo's theory of tides.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Galileo proposed that ocean tides are the result of Earth's motion in its orbit around the sun. But Galileo's theory of tides falsely predicted that there is only one high tide per day, when in fact there are two.

  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The map is actually the result of a subtraction.
  The subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.

  The scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The map is actually the result of a subtraction.
  The subtraction method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The method produces striking images of the brain at work.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans because it describes how the cheetah is the fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances. This is similar to how the FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, but the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and how it relates to their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The secondary substances in plants are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Insects have played a major role in many plants' having the secondary substances they have today.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  As the competition has progressed, fewer and fewer plants have remained as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  The main point of the passage is that the particular secondary substances possessed by different plants, and thus the distinctive tastes and smells that present-day plants have, result in large part from an evolutionary process of interaction between plants and insects.

  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden.
  The choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  The objection is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.

  The criticism of the second version of multicultural education is that it is not essentially different from the first version.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden.
  The choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  The objection is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be an argument that supports the idea that adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied is not necessary for real understanding.

  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.

  The passage describes the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
  Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  Corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments, and use highly conventional and readily recognizable imagery.
  The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.
  The despedida, the corrido's formal closing verse, has a set convention for the first and third lines, and the second and fourth lines are variable.

  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one that does not maximize the individual's anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.

  The passage explains that the utility maximization principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described rational response to economic incentives and disincentives would be the one that does not maximize the individual's anticipated overall satisfaction or expected utility.

  The passage describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style is late-Romantic manner music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.

  The passage explains that Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature.
  The radical critics believed that reality should be depicted ""as it is"" and that literature should be useful.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was shaped by the person who experienced it and that reality was far more than the merely tangible.
  He believed that the task of the writer was to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  He also believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit.""
  Therefore, Dostoyevsky disagreed with the radical critics' view of realism in literature because he believed that reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.
  The answer is A: reality is not independent of the experiences of individuals.

  The passage describes the writing on clay tablets found in Uruk.
  The writing on the tablets uses relatively few pictographic symbols.
  The tokens found in archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are identified as predecessors to the written word.
  The tokens were used to record villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools.
  The token system was replaced by a system of marks on clay tablets.
  The new system eventually evolved into a more abstract and flexible linguistic system.
  Therefore, the answer is C: eventually evolved into a more abstract and flexible linguistic system.

  According to passage A, auxiliary premises are used to derive a theory's predictions.
  When a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions in the prediction of Uranus' orbit was that no planets existed in its vicinity.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the answer should be the name of the planet that was hypothesized to exist in the vicinity of Uranus.

  When a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions in the prediction of Uranus' orbit was that no planets existed in its vicinity.
  The astronomers changed their assumptions about the existence of other planets, concluding that there must be another planet close enough to Uranus to produce the observed orbit.
  Therefore, the answer should be the name of the planet that was hypothesized to exist in the vicinity of Uranus.
Action: Answer(""C"") 
The correct answer is C: Neptune.

  The author argues that digital publishing is more economically efficient and convenient for customers.
  The elimination of whole categories of expense means that under the digital publishing model, authors would be responsible for a greater proportion of the value of the final product and would therefore be entitled to a larger share of the proceeds.
  The author suggests that established publishing houses, which are heavily invested in the infrastructure of traditional publishing, initially will be reluctant to accede to the new digital model of publishing.
  Under this competitive pressure, traditional publishers will have to reduce their redundant functions in order to accommodate higher royalty payments to authors or else they will lose their authors.

  The passage also explains that the researchers were not able to identify the by-products of the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The passage further explains that Meitner was able to recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists had not been so dismissive of the possibility of splitting atoms, they may have recognized the significance of the data sooner.
  Choice B suggests that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which could have allowed them to be more open to the possibility of splitting atoms.

  The question asks how Dunham's work in anthropology differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s.
  The passage states that Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at the time.
  Dunham's colleagues advised her not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, but she generally eschewed such caution and participated in the dances herself.
  Through prolonged immersion of this kind, Dunham was able not only to comprehend various dances as complex cultural practices, but also to learn the techniques well enough to teach them to others and incorporate them into new forms of ballet.
  Therefore, Dunham employed a participative approach in performing research, which differed from that of most other anthropologists in the 1930s.
  The answer is C: employed a participative approach in performing research.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind. It explains that the modular theory of mind may not be valid and that the subtractive method used in brain scans obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. The passage also explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. But what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use. Therefore, the statement that is most strongly supported by the passage is:

  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions.
  Prions are responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are unique because they lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present because they occur naturally in the body as proteins.
  The discovery of prions as a new class of infectious pathogens was initially received with skepticism but subsequent research has supported the conclusion.

  Passage A argues that insider trading is not always bad for the stock market.
  It argues that insider trading can help spread knowledge about a company's value and ensure that stock prices reflect a more accurate assessment of all the relevant facts.
  Passage B argues that insider trading is bad for the stock market because it undermines investor confidence and could ultimately destroy the market.
  It argues that insider trading gives some people an unfair advantage over others and denies companies access to the funds they need to grow and be successful.
  The question asks which law would conform most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.

  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons is possible.
  The first theory is that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses.
  The second theory is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically.
  The second theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community.
  The structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  Receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Each of the receptors in the neurotransmitter-gated ion channels family comes in several varieties.
  The discovery of the subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory emphasizes the increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  The economics of diminishing returns are easier to represent mathematically than those of increasing returns.
  Only since the late 1970s have increasing returns surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.
  The main point of the passage is that the Pin Factory, which emphasizes increasing returns to scale, has been neglected in economic theory because it is difficult to represent mathematically, but recent developments have enabled it to be modeled more rigorously.

  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to the relationships between mechanical components and features of automobiles.
  Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, while features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.

  The passage discusses the chemical composition of plants and the role of secondary substances.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances arose by mutation and were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for inferring that B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.

  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on the role of literature and art.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was literature's crucial source, but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The radical critics' demand that reality be depicted ""as it is"" was meaningless for Dostoyevsky.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit.""

  The passage describes a debate between two sides on how to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals, while the other side believes that the decision to commit a crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle that reconciles the two positions.

  The author also suggests that the government should attempt to save as many lives as it can, subject to the limited public and private resources devoted to risk reduction.
  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with the statement that supports the idea of saving as many lives as possible while considering the limited resources.
  Choice A is not supported by the passage because the author does not mention anything about socially useful purposes.
  Choice B is not supported by the passage because the author argues that policy experts tend to focus on aggregate lives at stake and that judgments about whether a risk is ""involuntary"" often stem from confusion and selective attention.
  Choice C is not supported by the passage because the author does not provide any information about the probability of occurrence and the probability of resulting death or injury for plane crashes and any other kind of risk incurred by airline passengers.
  Choice D is not supported by the passage because the author argues that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary risk is not a useful guide for policy decisions.
  Choice E is not supported by the passage because the author does not mention anything about the main category of risk that is usually incurred completely involuntarily.

  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The map is actually the result of a subtraction of a baseline measurement from a measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms, but the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures are still identifiably Western.
  Critics argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden.
  The objection is that it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
  Therefore, the strongest objection to the criticism of the second version of multicultural education would be an argument that the Western scientific heritage is not value-laden.

  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  This version holds that multicultural education ought to adopt a neutral stance with respect to the value differences among cultures.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  Thus, the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting, but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.

  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The passage also explains that an individual's decision to commit a crime can be analyzed as a rational economic choice.
  Therefore, the least appropriately described response to economic incentives and disincentives would be one that is not a rational economic choice.

  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.

  When a prediction fails, there is usually more than one possible explanation.
  One of the auxiliary assumptions made by astronomers was that no planets existed in the vicinity of Uranus.
  When the astronomers made their observations, they found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect.
  One possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, the answer is the object that caused the error in the auxiliary assumptions.

  The passage discusses the utility maximization principle and how it reconciles the two positions in the crime deterrence debate.
  The principle of utility maximization is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle holds that rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  The two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect within this framework.

  The passage explains that the physicists were not receptive to the possibility of splitting atoms.
  The passage also explains that the researchers were not able to identify the by-products of the experiments because they expected them to be elements close to uranium in nuclear composition.
  The passage also explains that Meitner was able to recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, if the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, they would have been more likely to recognize the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations and realize that atoms were being split.

  The passage explains that the physicists had compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  The researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Therefore, if the physicists had not been hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials, they would have been able to identify the products earlier and recognize that they were splitting atoms.
  The answer is D: More physicists concentrated on obtaining experimental results from the neutron bombardment of uranium.

  Dostoyevsky takes a third position that goes deeper than the second position.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality is different from the radical critics.
  Dostoyevsky believes that reality is shaped by the person who experienced it.
  The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art ""a shameful destiny.""
  A literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit.""
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be ""useful"" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and how they are different from medical diagnosis.
The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
The passage argues that the modular theory of mind may not be valid and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
The passage explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
The passage also explains that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
Action: Answer(""C"") 
Choice C is the most strongly supported statement by the passage. The passage explains that during the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and how they are different from medical diagnosis. The modular theory of mind is introduced as a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on. The passage also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it produces images of the brain at work. 
A: The passage does not support this statement. It introduces the modular theory of mind as a premise that the validity of neuroimaging in psychology depends on, but it also presents a critique of this theory. 
B: The passage does not support this statement. It is not mentioned that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. 
C: The passage supports this statement. It explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. The differential rate of oxygen use is what is depicted in the brain scan, and it is used to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. 
D: The passage does not support this statement. It is not mentioned that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. 
E: The passage does not support this statement. It is not mentioned that several regions of the brain ""lit up"" with metabolic activity when a brain scan subject experiences anger.

The author sees no reason to reject outright a form of evidence that has so ably withstood the test of time.
  Passage B argues that fingerprint examiners lack objective standards for evaluating whether two prints ""match.""

  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and how it was achieved.
  The physics community compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, but they did not recognize what they were witnessing.
  Theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle, it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner pursued research related to that of the Italians, discovering a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  In 1938, Meitner escaped from Nazi Germany and undertook related research in Sweden, but her research partner Otto Hahn kept her informed of his continuing experimentation.
  Late in that year, Hahn wrote to her of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

  The passage discusses two theories of how communication between neurons is possible.
  The first theory is that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by literally leaping across the synapses.
  The second theory is that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically.
  The second theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community.
  The mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions was not known for a long time.
  Recently, researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation: that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions.
  Prions are responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are different from other pathogens because they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape.
  Prions reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves on contact, one after another, into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  This cascade of transformations produces a plaque, consisting of thread-like structures, that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.
  Because prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.

  The exact mechanisms by which prions reproduce themselves and cause cellular destruction have yet to be completely understood.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If they were unable to reproduce themselves, abnormally shaped prions would not cause CJD.

  The passage describes the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen that causes CJD.
  Prions are different from other pathogens because they lack nucleic acid and reproduce themselves by initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The passage does not support choices A, B, D, or E.

  The passage discusses the discovery of a new type of protein pathogen called prions.
  Prions are responsible for causing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are different from other pathogens because they lack nucleic acid and consist mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins in many of the body's tissues, including white blood cells and nerve cells in the brain.
  Prions possess the capability of converting their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape and reproducing themselves in an unexpected way.
  The body does not produce an immune response when prions are present.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, though there are wide variations in pre-symptomatic incubation times and in how aggressively the disease progresses.
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.

  The passage does not support choices A, B, D, or E.
  Choice C is supported by the passage because the passage states that abnormally shaped prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way and that this cascade of transformations produces a plaque that collects in the brain and ultimately destroys nerve cells.

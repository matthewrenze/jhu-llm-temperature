  Other secondary substances are biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  Insects quickly come to prefer the plants whose defenses they can circumvent, and they eventually evolve the ability to identify them by their characteristic flavors or odors, or both.
  The passage does not provide support for inferring that some chemicals are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant.
  The passage does not provide support for inferring that most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.

  One side believes that societal norms and institutions influence individuals to commit crimes, while the other side believes that the decision to commit a crime is primarily the result of individual choice.
  Recent legal scholarship has introduced an economic principle that reconciles the two positions.
  The principle of utility maximization is used to analyze an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  The principle shows that the two crime-deterrence methods have the same overall effect.
  The passage concludes that the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both deterrence strategies.

  The passage describes how CFCs chemically attack and deplete the ozone layer, diminishing its effectiveness as a shield against ultraviolet radiation.
  The depletion of the ozone layer leads to an increase in the concentration of chlorine in the stratosphere.
  Chlorine and ozone chemically react in a way that both destroys the ozone and regenerates the chlorine atoms.
  The work of Molina and Rowland led to the development of an international agreement (the Montreal Protocol of 1987) to ban the production of ozone-depleting gases.

  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI scan depicts the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  Choice A describes how one particular district in the city voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  Choice B describes how a store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  Choice C describes how much more of the water supply is used by agricultural customers than by residential customers, so it is the agricultural sector that is impacted most severely when droughts occur.
  Choice D describes how Internet traffic is highest during the evening hours, so most Internet traffic during these peak hours originates in homes rather than in office buildings.
  Choice E describes how the cheetah is the world's fastest land animal only for short distances, so most cheetahs cannot outrun another land animal over long distances.

  The third paragraph discusses the second version of multicultural education.
  The second version of multicultural education holds that each culture should be taken on its own terms.
  However, the methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures in this second version of multicultural education are still identifiably Western.
  Critics of this second form of multicultural education argue that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, the logical over the intuitive, and the empirically verifiable over the mystical.
  The methods of social-scientific examination of cultures are thus already value-laden; the choice to examine and understand other cultures by these methods involves a commitment to certain values such as objectivity.
  To insist on trying to understand nonscientific cultures by the methods of Western science is not only distorting but is also an expression of an attempt to maintain a Eurocentric cultural chauvinism: the chauvinism of science.

  The passage describes the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border region.
  Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings and affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  The corrido takes its name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
  The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.
  The despedida, perhaps the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity, is the corrido's formal closing verse.
  The despedida of one variant of ""Gregorio Cortez"" is translated as follows: ""Now with this I say farewell / In the shade of a cypress tree; / This is the end of the ballad / Of Don Gregorio Cortez.""
  The first and third lines are a set convention. The second and fourth lines are variable, the fourth carrying the name of the corrido or expressing its subject, and the second varying according to exigencies of rhyme.

  In passage B, the astronomers made predictions about the orbit of Uranus based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions about the mass of the sun and the masses, orbits, and velocities of other planets.
  The astronomers found that the orbit they had predicted for Uranus was incorrect, and one possible explanation for the failure of their prediction was that there was an error in the auxiliary assumptions.
  Therefore, the answer should be the auxiliary assumption that was incorrect.

  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's position on the two opposing directions in Russian literary criticism.

  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.

  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.

  The second position is that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The third position is Dostoyevsky's, which is a realist position that goes deeper than the second position.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality is that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, and reality is far more than the merely tangible.
  The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art ""a shameful destiny.""
  A literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit.""
  Dostoyevsky defined artistry as the ability to write well and express thoughts in characters and images so that the reader has fully understood the author's thoughts.

  The passage discusses the discovery of prions, a new type of protein pathogen, which is responsible for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), a degenerative form of dementia in humans.
  Prions are capable of reproducing themselves without genetic material and initiating a chain reaction that induces normally shaped prions to transform themselves into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation.
  Prions occur naturally in the body as proteins, and the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.
  The discovery of the link between prions and CJD was initially received with great skepticism in the scientific community, but subsequent research has supported the conclusion that prions are an entirely new class of infectious pathogens.

  Passage A argues that insider-trading law should permit trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  Passage B argues that insider-trading law should prohibit trading based on information that other people don't have.
  The question asks for a law that conforms most closely to the position articulated by the author of passage A but not that articulated by the author of passage B.
  Therefore, the correct answer should be a law that permits trading based on information that everyone else doesn't have.
  Choice A prohibits trading based on information that is not shared by everyone, which is not what passage A argues for.
  Choice B permits trading based on information gained from analysis of a stock but prohibits trading based on information obtained from one's position within a company, which is partially what passage A argues for.
  Choice C prohibits trading that could reasonably be expected to undermine investors' confidence in the stock market, which is not what passage A argues for.
  Choice D legalizes selling based on inside information that a stock's price ought to be dropping but prohibits buying based on inside information that it should be rising, which is not what passage A argues for.

  The passage discusses two theories about how communication between neurons is possible.
  The first theory suggests that electrical impulses travel from one neuron to the next by leaping across synapses.
  The second theory suggests that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically.
  The passage then explains how the second theory has gradually won acceptance in the scientific community and how researchers have gathered enough evidence for a convincing explanation.
  The new evidence shows that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The attachment of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and so results in the opening of its channel component.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters display enough similarities to constitute a family, known collectively as neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
  Each of the receptors in this family comes in several varieties so that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances can be compared to the relationships between other entities.
  The relationships must involve two categories of entities, one of which is required for the proper functioning of the other.
  The first category of entities must be found in all members of the second category.
  The second category of entities must be a diverse and multitudinous array of entities that give the members of the category their distinctive characteristics.
  The answer choice that best describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances is B: Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run; features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them.

  The passage discusses two ways that art was produced by and for political and social elites.
  The second way is preferred by sociohistorical critics like Taruskin because it enables them to analyze how such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The passage suggests that some art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.

  The passage discusses the debate surrounding biotechnology patents and their impact on basic research.
  It mentions that industries and academic researchers support patent protection for discoveries with commercial potential.
  However, there are concerns that patenting biological materials may hinder basic research by restricting access to research materials.
  The passage argues that these concerns are largely misguided because patents do not necessarily imply the right to deny access and that patents may actually spur innovation.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that concerns about the negative impact of biotechnology patents on basic research are largely unfounded.

  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The scans actually depict the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is obtained by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  The subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is a situation where a differential method is used to obtain a measure of something, but the method obscures the fact that other factors are also involved.

  The passage describes the corrido, a type of narrative folk song from the Lower Rio Grande Border.
  Corridos are part of a long-standing ballad tradition that has roots in eighteenth-century Spain.
  Corridos combine formal features of several different types of folk songs, but their narratives consistently deal with subject matter specific to the Border region.
  The oldest corrido surviving in complete form is ""El Corrido de Kiansis"" (c. 1870), which records the first cattle drives to Kansas in the late 1860s.
  The different versions of any given story all partake of standard generic elements.
  Corridos served to commemorate significant local happenings, and their heavy reliance on familiar linguistic and thematic conventions served to affirm the cohesiveness of Border communities.
  The corrido takes its name from the Spanish verb correr, meaning to run or to flow, for corridos tell their stories simply and swiftly, without embellishments.
  The corrido is composed not only of familiar images but also of certain ready-made lines that travel easily from one ballad to another.
  In the corrido's formal closing verse, or despedida, the first and third lines are a set convention, and the second and fourth lines are variable.
  The despedida is the clearest marker of both the corrido's uniqueness and its generic continuity.

  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  The author also argues that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry.
  Therefore, the idea that free markets always get it right depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The author connects increased size with monopoly power.
  To undermine this connection, we need to find a statement that contradicts the idea that increased size leads to monopoly power.
  Option A talks about businesses that are able to exert monopoly power in one geographical region even though there are larger businesses in the same industry in other regions.
  This statement does not contradict the connection between increased size and monopoly power, but rather provides an exception to it.
  Option B talks about workers not being able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks.
  This statement is not related to the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Option C talks about businesses colluding to set prices as high as a true monopoly would.
  This statement supports the idea that increased size leads to monopoly power.
  Option D talks about the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry.
  This statement does not contradict the connection between increased size and monopoly power, but rather acknowledges that it may not apply to all industries.
  Option E talks about gains in productivity achieved by making workers even more specialized being offset by other factors such as higher training costs and increased turnover.
  This statement does not contradict the connection between increased size and monopoly power, but rather provides a limitation to the idea that increased specialization always leads to increased productivity.

  The tokens found in archaeological sites along the Jordan and nearby rivers are identified as predecessors to the written word.
  The tokens were used to record villagers' contributions to temple-based grain and livestock pools.
  The token system was replaced by a system of marks on clay tablets.
  The eventual evolution of this system into mature writing was more abstract and flexible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: eventually evolved into a more abstract and flexible linguistic system.

  Passage A discusses Popper's philosophy of science, which includes the idea that scientific research involves searching for evidence that would disprove theories.
  Passage B discusses two examples of how scientists revise their theories when their predictions are not borne out by observations.
  In the case of Uranus, scientists revised their auxiliary assumptions to include the existence of another planet, which they later discovered.
  In the case of Mercury, scientists hypothesized the existence of another planet, but it was never found. Later, Einstein's theory of relativity provided a better explanation for the observations.
  The common theme in both examples is that scientists revised their theories in response to new evidence that contradicted their predictions.

  Answer choice B suggests that the physicists did not have particular expectations regarding the likely nuclear composition of the by-products, which would have made it easier for them to identify the by-products as elements other than uranium.
  Answer choice B is the best answer because it suggests a change in the physicists' expectations that would have made it easier for them to recognize what they were witnessing.

  The passage discusses three significant positions in Russian literary criticism.
  The first position maintains that art should be above the present and the everyday.
  The second position argues that art should be useful and contribute to the creation of a new society.
  The third position is taken by Dostoyevsky, who is a realist and believes that reality is literature's crucial source.
  Dostoyevsky's understanding of reality is deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.
  He believes that there is no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality and that reality is far more than the merely tangible.
  The task of the writer is to explode the boundaries of the so-called real world.
  The radical critics' insistence that art must serve a particular political view was for Dostoyevsky the equivalent of assigning to art ""a shameful destiny.""
  A literary work must stand or fall on its ""artistic merit,"" he explained.
  The utilitarian claim that the formal aspects of a work were of secondary importance so long as its goal was good and its purpose clear struck Dostoyevsky as a contradiction in terms.
  The radical critics' requirement that art must at all costs be ""useful"" to people and society seemed to Dostoyevsky unsatisfactory.

The passage discusses the use of neuroimaging in psychology and the modular theory of mind.
The modular theory of mind is a premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and further that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions.
The author argues that this premise may not be valid and that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
The passage also discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it produces striking images of the brain at work.
The subtractive method subtracts the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.

  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result.
  Researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  The products remained unidentified partly because precise chemical analyses were hampered by the minute quantities of the substances produced and the dangers of working with highly radioactive materials.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations.
  Therefore, the answer is A: It neglected earlier theoretical developments.

  The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission.
  Scientists compiled increasing evidence that nuclear fission had been achieved, without, however, recognizing what they were witnessing.
  Earlier, some theoretical physicists had produced calculations indicating that in principle it should be possible to break atoms apart.
  The neutron-bombardment experiments were not aimed at achieving such a result, and researchers were not even receptive to the possibility that it might happen in that context.
  Meitner discovered a puzzling group of radioactive substances produced by neutron bombardment of uranium.
  Hahn wrote to Meitner of a surprising result: one of the substances resulting from the neutron bombardment of uranium had been conclusively identified as barium.
  It was Meitner who finally recognized the significance of the data in relation to underlying theoretical considerations: the researchers had actually been splitting uranium atoms.

The Pin Factory describes the increasing returns to scale, which lead to natural monopoly, while the Invisible Hand assumes diminishing returns to scale and many competitors in each industry. The passage also discusses why the Pin Factory was not included in economic theory for almost two centuries and how it has recently surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought. Therefore, the best answer is E: Economists have, until somewhat recently, failed to account for the increasing returns to scale common in many industries.

  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, which lead to natural monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry.
  The economics of diminishing returns lend themselves readily to elegant formalism, while those of increasing returns are notoriously hard to represent mathematically.
  Only since the late 1970s has the Pin Factory surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that increasing returns to scale, represented by the Pin Factory, have been neglected in economic theory due to the difficulty of representing them mathematically, but they are important to understand the functioning of markets.

  The passage discusses the contradiction between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand.
  The Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand are opposed to each other.
  The Pin Factory is an example of increasing returns to scale.
  The Invisible Hand depends on the assumption of diminishing returns.
  The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries.
  The Pin Factory was de-emphasized due to the difficulty of representing increasing returns mathematically.
  Only since the late 1970s has the role of increasing returns in economic thought surfaced into the mainstream.

The passage discusses the contradiction between two concepts in economic theory: the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. The Pin Factory represents increasing returns to scale, while the Invisible Hand represents the harnessing of self-interest to the common good. The two concepts are opposed to each other because increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, while the Invisible Hand requires many competitors in each industry. The assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries because it was easier to represent mathematically, while the Pin Factory was hard to represent mathematically. Only since the late 1970s has the Pin Factory surfaced into the mainstream of economic thought.

  The passage describes two categories of chemical substances found in plants: primary and secondary.
  Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  Secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
  The relationship between primary and secondary substances is most closely analogous to a set of relationships where one category is essential for proper functioning, while the other is not.

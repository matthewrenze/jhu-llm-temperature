  Passage A and B both discuss the phenomenon of people wanting to have more money than their neighbors, or the importance of relative prosperity.
  Passage A refers to it as ""rivalry"" and describes it as a phenomenon of people comparing themselves with their ""reference group"" and finding happiness in a relative position improvement.
  Passage B refers to it as a desire to create value, where people use material wealth to show not just that they are prosperous, but that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Neither passage describes the person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors with negative terms, such as insular, miserable, misguided, or primitive.
  Passage B explains that this desire is not necessarily egocentric, but rather evidence of a desire to create value and benefits society.

  Passage A talks about the phenomenon of rivalry and how people compare their income with some norm.
  The majority chose the first of the two options in the Solnick and Hemenway study in order to be poorer, provided their relative position improved.
  Passage B states that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel that they are successful.
  It suggests that the desire to create value benefits society.
  It does not describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors as egocentric, misguided or primitive.
  It does not describe such a person as cosmopolitan or lucky.
  The best choice is between insular and altruistic.
  A person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors might be described as insular since they are limited to their own little world.
  However, there is no clear evidence in the passage to suggest that someone who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors is doing so out of self-interest, or because they are insular.
  The passage indicates that people who want to make more money than their neighbors, do so to create value, which is beneficial for society.

  Passage A explains that people compare their income with some norm and that norm must be rising along with actual income. This comparison is the reason why richer people report higher levels of happiness than poorer ones. People compare their income with their reference group to determine their happiness. 
  Passage B explains that earning more makes people happier because relative prosperity makes them feel successful, that they have created value. People use material wealth to showcase to others that they are prosperous because they create value. 
  Both passages use evidence from studies to support their claims. 
  None of the choices directly describes a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors. The closest options are egocentric, misguided, and admirable.

  Passage A discusses how people have a tendency to compare their income with a norm that is rising along with actual income.
  According to this passage, people are more likely to invest in material objects to boost their position relative to their reference group.
  Passage B proposes that people want to create value and view themselves as successful due to relative success, not money per se.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that the authors would use the term ""misguided"" to describe someone wanting to make more money than their neighbors since they propose that people want to create value. 
  Similarly, it is unlikely that they would use the term ""primitive"" since they propose that the desire to create value benefits society.
  Insular and cosmopolitan are unrelated to the topic of the passages, so those options can be eliminated.
  Altruistic and egocentric are not mentioned in the passages, so those options can also be eliminated.

  Insects quickly identify plants whose defenses they can circumvent by identifying the specific flavors and odors.
  The competition between plants and insects has led to fewer and fewer plants remaining as suitable food sources for any one species of insect.
  Choice A is incorrect because secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plant growth or metabolism. 
  Choice B is correct. The passage states that some secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful. Hence most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.

  The passage talks about Dostoyevsky's position on reality, fantasy, and artistic merit in literature as opposed to the radical critics' views.
  Dostoyevsky believed that reality was much more profound and subjective than what the radical critics thought, and the fantastic must be ingrained with the tangible reality in a work of art.
  Dostoyevsky believed that a literary work should stand by its artistic merit and not be useful or serve any political views.
  The question asks which view of the radical critics would Dostoyevsky be most softened to.
  Among the choices, only one choice, when recognized by the radical critics, would likely have a positive effect on Dostoyevsky's attitude toward their views.
  Dostoyevsky already believed that a literary work should stand or fall on its artistic merit, so it would not be a factor in his attitude.
  Acknowledging the importance of eliminating elements of concrete reality is opposite to Dostoyevsky's position, so it would not be a factor that would soften his stance.
  Drawing sharper distinctions between reality and fantasy or explaining more fully their demand that reality be depicted as it is may not affect Dostoyevsky's position because he believed that reality was already subjective and that art should not be merely useful or serve political views.
  The only choice that could soften Dostoyevsky's position is if the radical critics put clarity of purpose ahead of formal aspects when evaluating a literary work.

  The passage describes a debate between two sides on the most effective way to deter deliberate crimes.
  One side suggests changing people's beliefs, increasing access to economic institutions, and rehabilitating criminals.
  The other side suggests increasing fines and penalties and strengthening law enforcement as a deterrence method.
  A new economic principle, utility maximization, reconciles the two positions by analyzing an individual's decision to commit a crime as a rational economic choice.
  Both deterrence methods increase the cost of committing a crime and affect the expected utility of criminal activity.
  The economic framework shows that the two positions are not fundamentally in conflict, and the optimal approach to crime deterrence would include elements of both.

  The sentence at lines 28-31 states the lawyer's responsibility is twofold: to the defendant and to society.
  The sentence at lines 7-11 introduces the topic of the article, questioning if it is necessary for defense lawyers to believe that their clients are innocent of the charges against them.
  The paragraphs that follow explain the scholars' and the author's opinions about the lawyer's role.
  The opinions of the scholars oppose the position that lawyers have an obligation to believe in their clients' innocence.
  The author does not agree with the scholars’ position and explains that lawyers should not deny or present assertions that they know to be false, but they should try to prove their clients innocent if they believe they are.
  Therefore, the information contained in the two sentences shows the author's position that lawyers should not defend clients they know are guilty and should not present false or insincere representation.

  Therefore, we are looking for a choice that describes a method that also produces a false impression of neat functional localization by selectively omitting some data.

  The FMRI's are usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is obtained by subtracting a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task.
  The reasoning is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work, but it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  The passage describes the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  The FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain that stands as a measure of metabolic activity and that actually depicts the differential rate of oxygen use through subtraction.
  The subtractive method of FMRI interpretation produces striking images of the brain at work but obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, the subtractive method of FMRI interpretation is most analogous to the way internet traffic is typically highest during the evening hours and originates from homes rather than from office buildings.

  The passage explains that FMRI scans depict the differential rate of oxygen use to show the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  The method used in interpreting FMRI scans is subtractive, where a baseline measurement is taken in the control condition, then a measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. 
  The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement. 
  The result of the subtraction is thought to represent the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question, giving a false impression of neat functional localization by obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Option A discusses how a particular district voted for the new mayor by an unusually large margin, so the mayor could not have won without that district.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  Option B talks about a store launching a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.
  This option is not analogous to the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.

  The passage describes how FMRI scans are interpreted.
  The scans are a measure of metabolic activity in different parts of the brain.
  The interpretation of these scans involves subtracting a baseline measurement from an on-task measurement.
  The resulting differential measurement is thought to represent only the metabolic activity of the cognitive task.
  However, this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  Therefore, we need to find an option that describes a situation where some aspect is obscured or overlooked while considering a larger whole.
  Option A describes how one district's vote contributed significantly to a mayoral win.
  Option B refers to the increase in summer shoppers due to a yearlong advertising campaign.
  Option C describes how droughts impact the agricultural sector more severely than they do on residential customers.
  Option D refers to the origin of the highest Internet traffic during peak hours.
  Option E describes how the cheetah is the fastest animal but only for short distances, and they cannot outrun other animals over long distances.

  The passage provides information about the manner in which FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted.
  FMRI scans of brain activity are interpreted using a subtractive method.
  The FMRI scans are subtractive in that the baseline measurement is subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The differential rate of oxygen use is what is depicted by FMRI scans, not the entire brain activity, which obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  The question asks for an analogy to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice A is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice B involves an advertising campaign and a seasonal increase in shoppers, which is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice C explains the usage of water supply by different sectors, but is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice D is about the time of day when Internet traffic is highest and is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans.
  Choice E is about the cheetah as the world's fastest animal and is not analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans. 
  The FMRI scan provides information about the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.

  The FMRI scan is interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain and depicted as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, the FMRI scan is actually the result of a subtraction of the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  One problem with the subtraction method is that it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

The critics of the second version of multicultural education hold that the Western scientific heritage is founded upon an epistemological system that prizes the objective over the subjective, logical over the intuitive, and empirically verifiable over the mystical. They argue that the second version of multicultural education is not essentially different from the first since it still uses identifiably Western methods of examination, study, and explanation of cultures. According to this objection, it is only by adopting the perspectives and methods of the cultures studied that real understanding can be achieved.
Option A is opposite to what the critics argue. They argue that genuine understanding of other cultures is impossible if the study of other cultures is refracted through the distorting lens of the majority culture's perspective.
Option B is different from what the critics argue, but it is in line with the description of the first proposal and its advocates.

  The utility maximization principle holds that, given a choice of actions, rational individuals will choose the action that maximizes their overall satisfaction.
  The expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  A person who responds rationally to economic incentives or disincentives will commit a crime if the expected utility from doing so, given the chance of getting caught, exceeds the expected utility from activity that is lawful.
  To respond rationally to economic incentives or disincentives means to consider the expected utility of the actions and weigh the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
  Answer choice A describes a person who considers the expected utility of the action.

The principle holds that individuals will choose the action that maximizes their anticipated overall satisfaction, or expected utility.
Expected utility is ascertained by weighing the utilities of the possible outcomes of an action according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass.
The economic principle of utility maximization assumes that individuals are rational and that they respond rationally to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice A, B, and D can be described as rational responses to economic incentives and disincentives.
Choice C can be considered as an irrational response to economic incentives and disincentives.

  The passage explains that within the utility maximization principle, an individual choice to commit a crime is analyzed based on economic incentives.
  Economic incentives are defined as the positive or negative consequences of an action, whether legal or illegal, that affect an individual's decision to carry out the action.
  The passage suggests that a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives is a choice that maximizes an individual's anticipated overall satisfaction.
  The passage also explains that the expected utility of an action is ascertained by determining the utilities of the possible outcomes of that action, weighing them according to the likelihood of each outcome's coming to pass, and then adding up those weighted utilities.
  Option A suggests that an individual is concealing income in order to reduce taxes which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option B suggests that an individual is avoiding speeding on a stretch of road which is a rational response to economic incentives and disincentives.
  Option C suggests that an industrialist is continuing to illegally discharge untreated pollutant into a river because the cost of treatment far exceeds the fine for illegally discharging the pollutant.
  This is a rational response to economic disincentives as the cost of the treatment outweighs the cost of the fines.
  Option D suggests that a government official is soliciting bribes because rampant inflation has rendered her government salary inadequate to support her and her family.
  This is a rational economic decision because the official needs more income to support herself and her family.
  Option E suggests that a worker physically assaults his former supervisor in a crowded workplace because he has been dismissed from his job and he believes that the dismissal was unwarranted and unfair.

  The author argues that bigger businesses are more efficient than smaller ones because they can achieve increasing returns to scale.
  However, increasing returns to scale create a natural tendency toward monopoly.
  Therefore, the author's argument depends on the assumption that returns to scale are diminishing, not increasing.
  The question asks which choice, if true, most undermines the connection the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.
  Choice A is not relevant to the author's argument.
  Choice B is also not relevant.
  Choice C supports the argument of the author.
  Choice D would undermine the assumption made by the author. If businesses can achieve increasing returns to scale at different sizes depending on the industry, then it is not necessarily that bigger businesses will automatically lead to monopoly power.
  Choice E does not undermine the author's argument, but it provides an alternative explanation for why increasing specialization may not lead to increased productivity.

  Therefore, an answer that shows an exception to the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power would weaken the author's argument.
  Answer A talks about some industries where larger businesses do not exert monopoly power in certain regions, which does not contradict the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power.
  Answer B is irrelevant to the argument.
  Answer C strengthens the argument since it shows that larger businesses collude to achieve monopoly power.
  Answer D talks about the variation of the size needed to achieve increasing returns, which does not contradict the general tendency of increased returns to lead to monopoly power.
  Answer E shows that gains in productivity from increased specialization may not offset the costs, which is irrelevant to the argument.

  The passage states that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly, and that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business until each industry is dominated by just a few players. 
  Therefore, any statement which shows that larger firms do not necessarily lead to monopoly power will undermine the author's argument.

  Answer choice A is irrelevant as it talks about monopoly power in one geographical region.
  Answer choice B is also irrelevant as it talks about salaries, which are not directly related to the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power.
  Answer choice C actually strengthens the connection between increasing returns and monopoly power as it talks about how businesses collude to set prices as high as a true monopoly.
  Answer choice D is plausible as it suggests that not all businesses can achieve increasing returns to scale to the same degree, and thus there may not be a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  Answer choice E is also plausible as it suggests that there are other factors that can offset productivity gains from increasing specialization.

  The author argues that the struggle between the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand arises due to the inherent contradiction between increasing returns to scale and the tendency toward monopoly.
  The author assumes that increasing returns to scale lead to the concentration of power in the hands of a few players in an industry.
  If there are other factors that prevent concentration of power despite increasing returns to scale, it would undermine the author's argument.
  Option A suggests that even though there are larger businesses in the industry, some businesses can still exert monopoly power in a particular geographical region. This implies that increasing returns to scale may not always lead to monopoly power.

  These leaders were more acculturated and hence more politically active than their predecessors.
  Garcia's argument assumes that ethnic consciousness increased as a result of this new leadership.
  The passage counters this argument by stating that it is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists.
  The passage also suggests that an increase in the number of Mexican Americans born in the United States does not necessarily result in an increase in ethnic consciousness.
  Therefore, it is likely that the passage supports the statement that variations in rates of Mexican immigration and naturalization account in part for variations in ethnic consciousness.

  The author notes that while there is no empirical research that directly tests the effectiveness of stealing thunder in actual trials, studies involving simulated trial situations have suggested that the technique is effective, at least within a reasonably broad range of applications. 
  The author also discusses several psychological explanations of why the technique should work.
  Therefore, the main point of the passage is that lawyers' commonly held belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by several psychological explanations of how that strategy may influence jurors.

  The author thinks that evolutionary psychology explains behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge or is not aware of.
  The author also thinks that such arguments can appear persuasive but are rare and need to be handled with great care.
  From passage A, the assertion that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies what the author of passage B means in calling evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"".
  This is because it explains behavior by imputing an interest (genes' conspiracy to propagate themselves) that the individual does not openly acknowledge.

The question asks for a factor that contributes to the success of stealing thunder.
In the given passage, the author discusses several psychological explanations as to why stealing thunder may be an effective tactic in courtroom proceedings. These include creating an image of credibility, providing an impetus for critical assessment, making the evidence seem scarce, and framing the evidence positively.
None of these factors are directly related to the timing of the thunder-stealing message in relation to the opposition's message.
Therefore, A is not the correct answer.
The passage mentions nothing about lawyers' abilities to assess jurors, so B is incorrect.
There is no mention of clients who are willing to testify about their past mistakes, so C is incorrect.
D is a possibility because the passage states that jurors are eager to solidify their position regarding the case and can be expected to use the early positive framing to guide their analysis of the trial information.

The passage talks about two theories concerning communication in the brain.
The first theory is that communication in the brain is guided exclusively by electrical signals. This theory is not popular with neurobiologists anymore.
The second theory is that communication in the brain is guided by chemicals, called neurotransmitters, that bind with receptors in receiving neurons to render them permeable to ions, thus transmitting an electrical impulse to the neuron.
The passage discusses one aspect of the second theory, which is how neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
The passage also discusses the implications of having discovered the structure of receptors.
One of those implications is that there are subtle differences among receptors in different parts of the brain, and that these differences have the potential to be exploited for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  This chemical theory gradually gained acceptance, but scientists were skeptical because they didn't know how the binding of a neurotransmitter to its receptor could influence the flow of ions through the cell membrane.
  Recently, researchers found that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions, and that the binding of the neurotransmitter to the binding site causes the receptor to change shape and open the channel component.

  The passage discusses two theories regarding the workings of the brain; electrical and chemical.
  The chemical theory explains how neurons communicate by secreting a neurotransmitter.
  This neurotransmitter is picked up by a receptor molecule which renders the neuron permeable to ions and generates an electrical impulse, which is transmitted to the receiving neuron.
  Recent research shows that the structure of the receptors plays a pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  This discovery is medically significant because it raises the possibility of the highly selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  The passage describes two theories on how the brain communicates between neurons.
  The first theory describes that electrical impulses travel through neurons.
  The second theory describes that neurotransmitters are released and bind with receptor molecules in the receiving neuron, rendering the neuron permeable to ions, which generates an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The article explains the mechanism by which neurotransmitters manage to render the receiving neuron permeable to ions.
  The new evidence shows that the structure of receptors plays the pivotal role in mediating the conversion of chemical signals into electrical activity.
  The receptors have a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  The receptors for neurotransmitters contain enough similarities to constitute a family.

  Scientists discovered prions can cause CJD.
  Prions normally exist as harmless cellular proteins, but they can convert their structures into a dangerous abnormal shape that has infectious properties.

  Prions, unlike other pathogens, occur naturally in the body as proteins, so the body does not produce an immune response when they are present.

  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to the views in choices A, B, D, or E.
  Choice C suggests that enduring high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
  However, the passage does not suggest this view. In fact, the passage claims that some art that goes against the grain of elite values endured.

The author presents Taruskin's position that art produced by elites reflects their ideology.
Taruskin and others prefer to analyze the way art embodied the ideology of the elite.
The author points out that the taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
The author also mentions that some of the enduring art went against the grain of elite values and was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Therefore, it can be inferred that the passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

The passage discusses how art was historically ""produced by and for political and social elites"" in two different ways.
One way was to create a work that expressed and mirrored the elite's ideals and way of life.
Taruskin and others prefer to deal with art produced the second way, as it embodied the ideology of the elite.
The passage suggests that Taruskin's position commits him to the view that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.
Thus, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

  The passage discusses two different ways in which art was ""produced by and for political and social elites.""
  The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin deal with the second kind of art produced by elites which expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life.
  They claim that in hidden ways, such art embodied the ideals of the elite, who were unaware that those ideals are revealed by work of which they overtly disapproved.
  Taruskin's position seems to commit him to the idea that high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

Taruskin's position prefers analyzing the art produced by the elite that embodied their ideology.
This art might not be enduring or always reflect the ideals of the elite.
Some artists had to find patrons with eccentric tastes to support their work.
The sociohistorical critic must look for hidden ways that art, which went against the grain of elite values, embodied the ideals of the elite.

The passage talks about Taruskin’s view on the production of art by and for political and social elites that reflects their values and way of life and how to analyze such art. Taruskin and others mostly deal with art produced by creating a work that reflected one’s ideals and way of life. This art embodies the ideology of the elite, and in some cases, it endures. The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to A, B, D, or E. Option C is a valid view as it aligns with the suggestion in the passage that the art that apparently undermines the ideals of the elite actually supports it in some way. Therefore, the answer is C: If it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

  The passage states that dance had been neglected as an area of social research because it was not recognized as scientifically rigorous. 
  This was due to the lack of trained social researchers in the field of dance, as well as the lack of training in social research for experts in dance.
  The passage also mentions that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.

In the passage, Katherine Dunham was one of the pioneers in the field of dance ethnology.
Previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research; no social scientist at that time was sufficiently trained in dance to be able to understand dance techniques, while experts in dance were not trained in the methods of social research.
Peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with which of the following statements about the study of dance?
Option A suggests that most social scientists misinterpreted the study of dance. There is no evidence of such a view in the passage.
Option B argues that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them, which contradicts Dunham's approach to research mentioned in the passage.
Option C proposes that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision. There is no suggestion of such a view in the passage.
Option D suggests that most experts in the field of dance are too preoccupied to conduct studies in the field of dance ethnology. There is no evidence to support this view in the passage.
Option E claims that dance forms are too variable across cultures to permit rigorous means of data collection. There is no such view in the passage.
The passage suggests that peers would not have recognized dance as an area of social research and therefore would have neglected it. Therefore the answer is C: Research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.

  Passage A and Passage B both describe the desire for people to earn more money than others.
  Passage A refers to this as the phenomenon of rivalry and explains that people are happy being poorer, if their relative position improves.
  Passage B refers to this as material wealth and explains that people use it to show that they are prosperous because they create value.
  Neither passage implies that the person has negative character traits or emotions such as misery.
  Both passages present the desire as being driven by human nature or societal values.
  Based on this, it is unlikely that the authors would use terms like ""misguided"" or ""altruistic"" to describe a person who wants to make more money than his or her neighbors.

  The passage discusses the controversy surrounding the patenting and commercialization of biotechnology inventions, particularly those based on discoveries arising from basic research. There is concern that the restrictions on access to research materials, such as genetic sequences and cell lines, needed by scientists to conduct basic research may arise from enforcement of a patent right or through a contractual agreement. The author argues that fears that patenting biotechnology discoveries will result in the patent holder's trying or threatening to enjoin further research via a legal action for patent infringement are unfounded and that patents will not hinder basic research. The author notes that the commercialization of research has led to a shift from the traditional communal approach to a market model and offers an alternative view that patents provide scientists with incentives and rewards to innovate.
  Thus, option A, B, C can be ruled out.
  Option D can be ruled out because the author agrees that there are concerns expressed by academic researchers that biotechnology patents will negatively affect their ability to conduct basic research but argues that such concerns are largely misguided.

  The passage doesn't discuss anything that is directly refutable or that contradicts the options except for option C, which is contradicted by the text that mentions the characteristic flavors or odors that insects evolve to identify specific plants.
  Option B seems plausible because the passage discusses how insects have evolved to circumvent a plant's defenses against them, but it is too extreme to say that most plants with chemical defense systems are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects.
  Option A seems to be true, but it is not the main point of the passage.

  The passage discusses the role of primary and secondary substances in plants.
  The secondary substances give plants distinctive tastes and smells that are often a result of plant-insect evolution.
  Some of these secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they attract pollinating insects or protect the plants from plant-eating insects.
  Insects have to evolve ways to circumvent the defenses of the plants they eat to survive, which might include identifying plants by their characteristic flavors or odors or both.
  Option (A) is true, but it is not the main topic of the passage.
  Option (B) partially corresponds to the information, but the passage also mentions that some secondary substances cause insects to die or suffer unpleasant symptoms.
  Option (C) contradicts the information given as the passage states that insects identify botanically restricted groups of plants by their characteristic flavors or odors or both.
  Option (D) is mentioned in the passage as it states that new secondary substances appear as the result of genetic mutations in plants, and only a few substances occur in any one species of plant.
  Option (E) correctly states that there are toxic substances produced by plants that evolved in correlation with secondary substances, but the primary focus of the passage is not on these toxic substances.
  
Therefore, the correct answer is A: Some chemicals that are not known to be directly involved in the growth or metabolism of any species of plant play vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants.

  The passage discusses primary and secondary substances in plants and their roles.
  Secondary substances arise from genetic mutations in individual plants.
  Secondary substances that are scents signal the presence of nectar to attract insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances are biochemical defenses against plant enemies, many of which are insects.
  Insects may switch to other foods or develop ways to circumvent the plants' defenses.

  Choice A: The passage mentions secondary substances that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants but provides no support for such chemicals playing vital roles in the lives of various kinds of plants. Incorrect.
  Choice B: The passage states that many insects circumvent plants' defenses to eat these plants, supporting the idea that plants' chemical defense systems are often ineffective. Correct.
  Choice C: The passage mentions that many insects can identify plants by their characteristic flavors or odors, and it presents no countervailing evidence. However, the passage does not support the idea that most insects are able to do so or that they feed exclusively on certain botanically restricted groups of plants. Incorrect.
  Choice D: The passage describes secondary substances as arising from genetic mutations in individual plants, but it provides no support for toxic substances evolving independently in unrelated species of plants but surviving in only a few species. Incorrect.
  Choice E: The passage mentions toxic substances produced by plants in passing but provides no support for the idea that they evolved in correlation with secondary substances but are not themselves secondary substances. Incorrect.

Thus, the answer is B: Most plants that have evolved chemical defense systems against certain insect species are nevertheless used as food by a wide variety of insects that have evolved ways of circumventing those defenses.

  Increasing returns to scale refer to a situation where a larger production or factory results in a larger per worker output.
  According to the passage, the pin factory uses increasing returns to scale to efficiently increase production.
  The passage mentions that bigger firms drive smaller firms out of business and that monopolies can be an issue with the use of increasing returns to scale.
  Therefore, we can find the choice that best illustrates the use of increasing returns to scale through the example that depicts a larger production or factory results in a larger per worker output while avoiding the issue of creating monopolies.
  Choice B, the one about the bee colony, is the best illustration: the use of some bees solely to guard its nectar sources enables the colony to collect more nectar, which can feed a larger colony that can better divide up the work of processing the nectar.

  Such returns to scale lead to gains for larger firms creating a tendency toward monopoly, driving smaller firms out of business.
  With increasing returns, the market power that larger firms develop could distort competition, undermining the power of the invisible hand to allocate resources efficiently.
  Only if firms experience diminishing returns at some point do small firms have an opportunity to enter and compete in the marketplace.

  Answer B is not correct because it describes a system designed to conserve resources, not to increase productivity per worker.
  Answer C is not correct because year-round schooling does not enable more students to be served per worker.
  Answer D is not correct because it describes a technological advance rather than larger firms leading to greater productivity per worker.

  The passage describes the Pin Factory concept as an example of increasing returns to scale.
  According to the passage, increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.

  The choices given in the question best illustrate increasing returns to scale if they describe how a larger size or increased scale leads to increased productivity and hence increased output.
  Choice A describes reduced standards resulting in fewer editors, so it is not a good example of increasing returns.
  Choice B relates to bees processing nectar, which is not related to a business or enterprise and does not involve increasing returns.
  Choice C talks about a higher number of students in a single building, but does not indicate how the increased scale leads to increased productivity and hence output, so it is not a good example of increasing returns.

  Increasing returns to scale is the concept that the bigger the operation, the more efficiently it can produce goods or services per worker.
  In the passage, the example of a pin factory is given to illustrate the concept.
  As the factory grows larger, its workers can specialize in more specific tasks, which increases production per worker.
  This means that increased size leads to lower costs per unit produced.
  So, the example that best illustrates the concept of increasing returns to scale would be one in which the larger operation produces more goods or services per worker than a smaller operation.
  Choice A does not illustrate this idea; it describes a reduction in the workforce, not an increase in scale.
  Choice B describes a process of specialization, but not necessarily an increase in scale, so it does not capture the idea of increasing returns to scale.

  Choice A is about downsizing, which goes against the principle of scale and reducing the number of workers. Choice B is about specialization but it is not about increasing the scale, but more about the division of labor. Choice C is about using the same resources more efficiently, but it does not relate to increasing the number of employees. Choice D is about the technological improvement of a process, which does not make it clear how the scale affects the increase in production. Choice E is about the division of one colony into many colonies, which increases the number of ants but does not relate to the scale of a production process.

  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale means that a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business, and that there are increasing returns to scale since the bigger the pin factory, the more specialized its workers can be, and therefore the more pins the factory can produce per worker. Therefore, an example of increasing returns to scale is likely to describe how a larger business is able to achieve lower costs than a smaller business by producing more products.
  Choice A doesn't involve producing more products, so it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice B describes a way that a larger bee colony is able to collect the same amount of nectar with more efficiency, but doesn't involve producing MORE nectar.
  Choice C doesn't involve producing more products, so it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice D doesn't involve producing a bigger quantity of lobsters with the same number of traps. It describes how a technology improvement allowed an industry to catch more lobsters more efficiently. Therefore, it's not increasing returns to scale.
  Choice E describes how a larger number of ants are produced as a consequence of breaking into two competing colonies. But there isn't an increase in the ability to produce more ants per worker. Therefore, it doesn't illustrate the concept of increasing returns to scale.
  Choice B involves different tasks being assigned to different sets of bees, and this specialization of bees is allowing the colony to collect more nectar. This specialization of tasks enables the colony to collect more nectar, as each bee is specialized and more efficient at performing the tasks it's assigned. Therefore, in choice B there is an increase of nectar being produced per worker, just like in the Pin Factory example.

  The passage describes Dostoyevsky's third position on Russian literary criticism in which he emphasized the importance of reality as the source of literature.
  Dostoyevsky did not agree with the radical critics' demand that literature should only serve a political view or that literature should be useful.
  He believed that reality was shaped by the individual's experiences and there was no distinction between fantasy and reality.
  He also believed that artistic merit was necessary for a literary work and a literary work must stand or fall on its own artistic merit.

  The passage compares FMRI scans in the study of psychology with X-rays in the field of medical diagnosis.
  FMRI scans are a research method used as a way to see the mind's distinct modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions.
  The FMRI scans are actually the result of subtraction - the baseline measurement taken during the control condition and the second measurement taken while the subject performs some cognitive task.
  The subtraction produces striking images of the brain's active parts.
  The interchangeable parts in a system can also be seen in modules and the difference between two states can provide useful information on how the system behaves.
  Therefore, the pattern in which FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted is most analogous to option B where the yearlong advertising campaign affected the increase in shoppers only during the summer season.

  The passage explains how FMRI scans which produce striking images of the brain activity are produced through the subtractive method.
  The FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity.
  However, what it actually depicts is the differential rate of oxygen use, by first taking a baseline measurement and then subtracting the on-task measurement.
  The method of interpreting FMRI scans is most analogous to the option that describes a process of determining the difference between two variables.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A store launched a yearlong advertising campaign and had an increase in shoppers only during the summer, so the advertisements affected only the summer shoppers.

  The question is asking for an analogy to how FMRI scans of brain activity are typically interpreted.
  An analogy will show how this method can be explained by comparing it to another familiar situation.
  The passage states that FMRI scans are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen in the brain, which is the differential rate of oxygen use.
  This differential rate only subtracts the baseline measurement from the cognitive task measurements to reveal the metabolic activity associated with the cognitive task alone.

  The question asks to find the option that is most analogous to the interpretation of FMRI scans of brain activity described in the last two paragraphs.
  According to the passage, the FMRI scans of brain activity depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain.
  The FMRI results are obtained by subtracting the baseline measurement in the control condition from the measurement when the subject is performing the cognitive task to find the metabolic activity associated solely with that cognitive task. 
  The FMRI method obscures the fact that the brain is active in both conditions, and a false impression is given by differential brain scans that subtract out all the distributed brain functions.
  Answer choice C, about water supply, might be misunderstood for a correct answer. This option talks about impact and not interpretation, which is what the question asks.
  Option A talks about a specific district that is essential to electing a candidate, analogous only in being one of many variables that considered one way produces a result and another way produces a different one.
  Option B talks about how an advertisement affected customer behavior only during the summer, analogous only in being one of various factors that influenced the outcome.
  Option D speaks about the origin of Internet traffic during peak hours, but unrelated to the interpretation of the data.
  Option E speaks about the limitations of the cheetah's speed only in some circumstances, which is not analogous to the interpretation of brain scan data as FMRI scan data.

  The interpretation of FMRI scans is based on a subtraction method by taking a baseline measurement in the control condition, then a second measurement while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement.
  The reasoning behind the subtraction method is that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.

The paragraph discusses the ""cognitive framework"" jurors create and how that can influence the way they evaluate information presented later in the trial.
The preceding sentence implies that revealing negative information (""stealing thunder"") early in a trial refers to the presentation of negative information early on in the trial while ""framing"" that information to downplay its severity, thereby creating an early positive impression.
This technique is useful when the negative information can be framed positively.
Therefore, the primary aim of discussing the ""cognitive framework"" that jurors create is to suggest that damaging evidence that is framed positively early in a trial will have a greater impact than damaging evidence presented later in a trial.

  The passage also asserts that the corrido maker affirms that he has related an authentic Border tale in the despedida.
  Therefore, the passage provides the most support for inferring that most corrido variants have the same despedida. The answer is D: Most corrido variants have the same despedida.

  Option B describes another rational response, where a motorist avoids speeding because of the potential loss of her driver's license, which would reduce her overall satisfaction.

 Matthew Arnold, however, identified these classes as barbarians and philistines with interests not quite in sync with producing art.
 These artists had to find a place in the margins of the establishment with rich patrons with eccentric tastes.
 However, over time, some of this non-conforming art endured, although there were misgivings.
 The sociohistorical critic like Taruskin is interested in this art that went against elite values, making analogies and justifications to the claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.

The passage discusses two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them.
The first way was to engage a well-known artist to produce something for display.
The second way was to create, or to have created, a work that expressed and mirrored one's ideals and way of life.
The sociohistorical critics prefer to deal with the second way to analyze the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always been apt to produce an art that endures.
Some of this art that went against the grain of elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
Therefore, the main point of the passage is that there have historically been two distinct ways in which members of the elite classes have had art produced for them and sociohistorical critics must engage in a form of Freudian analysis to justify the claim that works of art embody the ideals of the elites.

   The question is asking for a statement that would weaken the link between increasing size and monopoly, which has been discussed in the context of the Pin Factory and the Invisible Hand. 
   The passage argues that the tendency towards monopoly is created by the natural inclination of large businesses to drive smaller businesses out of the industry with superior economies of scale established through specialization. 
   Options A, C, and E do not relate to the size of the business, and therefore would have no bearing on the relationship between increased size and monopoly power. 
   Option B suggests that increasing specialization may have consequences outside producing more units. It recognizes that, while specialization may increase productivity, there are negative impacts on salary rates, implying the specialization being negated or limited via other means.
   Option D, however, raises a specific concern about the variety of relationships between size and returns to scale across the industries. If there are differences in the size necessary for increased economies of scale between different fields, then larger businesses would not necessarily dominate and push smaller businesses out of the industry. This would weaken the notion that increased size inevitably leads to monopolization.
Conclusion: 
   Option D gives an explanation which contradicts the claim that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business based only on economies of scale. Thus, undermining the argument that increased scale leads to monopolistic forces.

  The author argues that increasing returns to scale tend to create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author also argues that the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory for almost two centuries, and only in the late 1970s did increasing returns surface into the mainstream of economic thought.
  So, the answer choice that would most undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power would imply that either increasing returns to scale do not tend to lead to a natural tendency towards monopoly, or that the assumption of diminishing returns did not dominate economic theory for two centuries.
  Answer choice (A) suggests that there may be reasons to explain why some businesses in the same industry are able to exert monopoly power while larger businesses are not. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (B) addresses the effects of specialization on salaries, but it does not directly address the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (C) suggests that even where an industry is dominated by only a few players, they cannot necessarily exert monopoly power because they often collude. It does not undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Answer choice (D) acknowledges that the size a business must reach to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This implies that increasing returns may not directly lead to monopoly, thereby undermining the connection between increased size and monopoly power.

  The author argues that increased size could lead to a monopoly; 
  The Pin Factory theory illustrates the struggle between increasing returns and diminishing returns When we apply increasing returns to a business, it tends to dominate smaller businesses, leading to monopoly power. Diminishing returns work against the tendency towards monopoly, enabling several competitors to exist.
  Therefore, in answering this question, we need to find an option that presents a context where increased size does not necessarily lead to monopoly power.
  Option D suggests that the scale of business required to achieve increasing returns varies from industry to industry. The realization of increasing returns may not be proportional to the size of the business, making it difficult for one business to dominate others easily regardless of their size. Thus option D undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power

  The connection that the author draws is that larger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business due to increasing returns to scale which favors monopoly power.
  If there are larger businesses in the same industry but smaller businesses can still exert monopoly power in some regions, this would weaken the connection.
  Option A states exactly this, so it could be the answer.
Action: Answer(""A"")
"
gpt-35-turbo,chain_of_thought,lsat-rc-100,1.0,46,5,"Thought:
  The author argues that increasing returns create a natural tendency toward monopoly because a large business can achieve larger scale and lower costs. 
  But the invisible hand is countered by natural monopolies because there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  Therefore, the assumption of diminishing returns dominated economic theory.
  Thus, any answer that suggests that the connection between increased size and monopoly power is weakened would likely try to show that natural monopolies or decreasing returns to scale are not necessarily linked.
  Answer choice (A) suggests that larger businesses do not always have lower costs or higher profitability than smaller businesses, which could cast doubt on the relationship between size and monopoly.

  The passage explains that increasing returns to scale can lead to monopoly power because a larger business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business.
  To avoid monopoly power, the invisible hand requires many competitors in each industry, so that nobody has monopoly power.
  The passage suggests that if increasing returns to scale vary widely from industry to industry, it would undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is D.

  The author argues that bigger firms tend to drive smaller firms out of business. 
  This is because a large business can achieve larger scale and hence lower costs than a small business. 
  The connection between increased size and monopoly power is based on the assumption of increasing returns. 
  If the assumption of increasing returns is undermined, it would also undermine the connection. 
  Option A, C, and E do not provide any evidence to counter the assumption of increasing returns and its connection to monopoly power. 
  Option D only provides that the size required to achieve increasing returns varies from industry to industry. 
  Option B, however, provides that as the tasks workers focus on become narrower, the workers are not able to command as high a salary as when they were performing a greater variety of tasks. 
  This suggests that there are diminishing returns to specialization and increased size, which would undermine the assumption of increasing returns. 
  Therefore, B would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

gpt-35-turbo,chain_of_thought,lsat-rc-100,1.0,46,8,"Thought:
The author argues that increasing returns to scale lead to natural monopoly, which is a problem for the invisible hand to work properly. Therefore, the connection between increased size and monopoly power should exist in a situation of increasing returns to scale.

  The author states that increasing returns create a natural tendency towards monopoly.
  The author notes that for the invisible hand to work properly, there must be many competitors in each industry, so that nobody can exert monopoly power.
  If one industry is dominated by large businesses, then these businesses may have the ability to exert monopoly power.
  
  A: This statement only mentions that businesses can exert monopoly power in one geographical region. This doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  B: This statement is not relevant to the connection between increased size and monopoly power. 
  C: This statement supports the argument made by the author that increasing returns lead to monopoly power. Hence, it doesn't undermine the connection between increased size and monopoly power.
  D: This statement shows that the size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that increasing returns to scale may not always lead to monopoly power. 
  E: This statement suggests that there may be other factors at play that limit the benefits of increasing specialization. This undermines the connection between increased size and monopoly power because it suggests that one cannot always achieve increased returns to scale by increasing specialization.

Therefore, D: The size that a business must reach in order to begin to achieve increasing returns to scale varies widely from industry to industry would most undermine the connection that the author draws between increased size and monopoly power.

  The passage implies that the relationship between ethnic consciousness and the Mexican American population is complex and influenced by many variables. 
  The passage notes that the proportion of the Mexican American population that had been born in the United States had significantly increased by 1930. 
  Garcia argues that by 1930-1960, a new generation of Mexican American leaders appeared, one that was more acculturated and hence more politically active than its predecessor.
  It is not clear how far this outlook extended beyond these activists and if an increase in the proportion of Mexican Americans born in the United States necessarily resulted in an increase in the ethnic Mexican population's political activism.

  Passage B discusses what happened when astronomers attempted to predict the orbit of Uranus and later the orbit of Mercury, based on Newton's laws and auxiliary assumptions.
  It is mentioned that one of the auxiliary assumptions about Uranus was that no planets existed in its vicinity, but later that assumption turned out to be false which lead them to hypothesize the existence of another planet (later named Neptune), whereas, some scientists thought Newton's laws were in error.
  For Mercury, also using Newton's laws as an auxiliary assumption, they hypothesized the existence of another planet which they named 'Vulcan', which was never found.
  Finally, when Einstein's general theory of relativity was introduced, it explained the observed orbit of Mercury and led to the rejection of Newton's theory of gravity.
  Based on the above understanding, the answer should be the option that mentions a force that can cause disturbance in an orbit.
  The option E which mentions the moon is irrelevant and can be ruled out.
  Option A Uranus is the planet whose orbit was predicted, and auxiliary assumptions were made that turned out to be false, but there is no mention of any disturbing force.
  Option B, the sun, is not mentioned in the context of being a disturbing force.
  Option C Neptune is the planet that they later discovered which explained the orbit of Uranus thus not a disturbing force.
  Option D, Mercury, was the planet whose orbit was predicted using the auxiliary assumptions of Newton's laws and other theories. They later hypothesized that there might be another planet close enough to cause disturbance but later rejected that idea.

  The author suggests that the new digital model of publishing that involves the on-demand printing of digitized books is likely to displace or at least rival traditional publishing.
  Such a model would eliminate the costs of physical inventory and reduce several costs of traditional publishing.
  This new model would make publishing less expensive and more convenient for customers.
  Under this new model, established publishers will have to adjust their traditional practices to compete with upstart digital-publishing firms and accommodate higher royalty payments to authors.

  The passage states that for Dostoyevsky, there was no distinction in principle between fantasy and reality, but reality was necessarily shaped by the person who experienced it.
  Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Dostoyevsky would most likely disagree with the idea that art should stand high above the present and the everyday since he believes that there is no distinction between fantasy and reality, so art should incorporate the perception of reality by an individual.

  The passage mentions that Dostoevsky believed reality was literature's crucial source but his understanding of reality went deeper than the one prevailing among radical critics.

  Passage B suggests that evolutionary psychology is similar to a conspiracy theory because it explains behavior through imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge, or is not aware of.

gpt-35-turbo,chain_of_thought,lsat-rc-100,1.0,67,6,"Thought: 
  The author of passage B describes evolutionary psychology as a conspiracy theory.
  In a conspiracy theory, behavior is explained by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  We need to identify an assertion from passage A that most clearly exemplifies this description.
  The author of passage A suggests that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear altruistic, such as a mother's rushing to help her injured child, and that the application of altruistic mechanisms to an entire group would have promoted the propagation of genes responsible for those mechanisms.
  This assertion exemplifies the idea that an interest in self-propagation explains behavior that is not openly acknowledged because it suggests that seemingly altruistic behavior is actually motivated by an evolutionary interest in propagating genes.

  Passage B calls evolutionary psychology a ""conspiracy theory"" because it tries to explain behavior by imputing an interest that the agent of the behavior does not openly acknowledge.
  In other words, passage B thinks that evolutionary psychology's focus on explaining behavior from an evolutionary standpoint is based on a kind of conspiracy theory.
  Therefore, we need to find a statement from Passage A that most clearly exemplifies this perspective.
  Statements that explain the focus or problems of evolutionary psychology do not exemplify the claim in Passage B.
  Similarly, statements that explain the reasons or mechanisms behind behavior do not exemplify the claim.
  However, the statement that genes may promote their self-propagation through actions that appear unselfish exemplifies this claim.
  By this logic, evolutionary psychologists see apparent altruism as genetic ""selfishness"" with the goal of propagating genes.

  Passage A and B use the term ""conspiracy theory"" differently.
  Passage B uses it to mean the explanation of behavior by imputing an interest (the proliferation of genes) without evidence.
  Passage A does not use it to imply that evolutionary psychology is baseless or unfounded; instead, it acknowledges the difficulty of determining an evolutionary explanation for altruism.
  The assertion that best exemplifies what the author of passage B calls a ""conspiracy theory"" is the one that imputes an unconscious motive to an individual behavior without supporting evidence.

The phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" is used in the context of discussing life histories of Native Americans solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.
The phrase means a collaborative effort by two or more people with different cultural identities to produce a written document, namely, autobiographies of Native Americans.
Option A (""written by a member of one culture but based on the artifacts and oral traditions of another culture"") suggests that the writings are based on oral or written traditions and artifacts, which is not necessarily true. Furthermore, the option does not address the collaborative and composite nature of the authorship.
Option B (""written by two people, each of whom belongs to a different culture but contributes in the same way to the finished product"") suggests that the authors belong to different cultures and contribute equally to the finished product. While it is possible that collaborative efforts include authors of equal standing, there is no indication of such in the passage. Furthermore, the option limits the authorship to two people, which is not necessarily true.
Option C (""compiled from the writings of people who come from different cultures and whose identities cannot be determined"") suggests that the authorship is compiled from writings, not necessarily autobiographies, of people of different cultures. Furthermore, the identities of the authors are not necessarily unknown or indeterminate, as the passage explicitly says that the autobiographies were ""solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.""
Option D (""written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture"") suggests that the writing is the product of editing and revisions done by members of different cultures. This option is closer in meaning to the phrase used in the passage, but it does not indicate the composite nature of the authorship, which involves multiple types of collaboration between the authors.
Option E (""written by a member of one culture but based on oral communication by a member of another culture"") suggests that the writing is based on oral communication by a member of another culture. This option does not capture the collaborative and composite nature of the authorship that involves multiple types of collaboration.
The best option that captures the meaning of the phrase ""bicultural composite authorship"" would be D: ""written originally by a member of one culture but edited and revised by a member of another culture."" The phrase implies a multi-step process involving multiple collaborators working together to produce the final written product.

  The subject of the sentence ""bicultural composite authorship"" is the as-told-to life histories.
  The prefix ""bi-"" means two so it refers to two different cultures that collaborated in writing the life histories.
  The clue in the sentence is that the life histories ""were solicited, translated, recorded, and edited by non-Native American collaborators.""
  This means a Native American person was sharing their life story with non-Native Americans who helped translate the story into a written document.

  The passage outlines the career of Arnold Schoenberg, a composer who provoked controversy through his musical innovations.
  Schoenberg's music involved changing the traditional language of music through three phases that each pushed the boundaries of what was considered tonal harmony.
  He ultimately developed the 12-tone technique, a system for stabilizing non-tonal music.
  Schoenberg's career progression is likened to Beethoven's in that both composers pushed musical boundaries and stirred controversy in their time.
  The real value of Schoenberg's music lies in its ability to express new emotional states, not merely technical innovations.
  The passage seems to suggest that Schoenberg is a highly significant figure in music history, even if his music is not always well-received.
Actions: 
  A: The passage discusses both positive and negative views of Schoenberg's music, but it does not suggest that it is still predominantly regarded as ""shrill and incoherent.""
  B: The passage compares Schoenberg and Beethoven, but it does not make a direct argument that Schoenberg should be regarded as highly as Beethoven.
  C: The discussion of Schoenberg's development as a composer, and the analysis of his music as important for emotional expression, support the idea that his music is worthy of admiration despite some initial difficulty of reception. Thus, the answer is C: Though Schoenberg's music has not always been well received by listeners, it is worthy of admiration for both its expressive range and its technical innovations.
  D: The passage mentions the 12-tone technique but does not give any argument that it is the most important aspect of Schoenberg's work.
  E: The passage notes that Schoenberg's music became more popular after the invention of the phonograph but does not compare him and Beethoven as mutually exclusive. Therefore, E is incorrect.

The passage talks about brain scans as pictures of mental activity and the challenges of using them as a research method in psychology. The passage argues that the validity of using neuroimaging in psychology depends on a premise that ""independent modules"" of the mind can be identified in distinct regions of the brain. However, this modular theory of mind suggests that the mind can be broken down into separate and distinct modules, which the passage questions as being a simplified view of mental activity. The FMRI imaging technique produces images of the brain at work. The technique constructs these images through the differential method of comparing baseline measurements in the control condition with measurements while the subject is performing a cognitive task.

  While the modular theory of mind posits independent modules in specific regions of the brain, a more general approach argues that various mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain.
  In functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI), a baseline measurement is taken before a cognitive task is performed, so that the on-task measurement can be subtracted from it.
  The remainder is seen as the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question.
  So, areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The passage talks about brain scans and the modular theory of mind.
The modular theory of mind assumes that mental processes are independent modules located in distinct regions of the brain.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) produces brain scans that are interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use.

  Choice (B) does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it simply states that Lichtenstein praised an abstract expressionist painter for producing an atypically emotional painting.
  Choice (C) does not contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein as it simply states that Lichtenstein praised an early abstract expressionist for producing emotional paintings.
  Choice (D) could contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein if he criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing emotional paintings since his own work is characterized as a rebellion against the excessive emotionalism of abstract expressionism.
  Choice (E) could contradict the author's characterization of Lichtenstein if he criticized a pop artist in the 1960s for producing paintings void of emotion since his own work is characterized as having an inner sweetness.

  The author characterizes Lichtenstein as a painter who:
  - helped to define pop art using commonplace objects and commercial-art techniques in paintings
  - merged a popular genre with the forms and intentions of fine art generating a result that conveyed a seriousness of theme transcending mere parody
  - rebelled against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism
  - had an impulse towards realism and depicted contemporary life
  - used comic-art conventions and a nostalgia fills his paintings that gives them an inner sweetness
  
  The question asks which of the following would MOST challenge the author's characterization of Lichtenstein.
  If Lichtenstein did the opposite of what the author characterizes him as doing, it could challenge the author's claims.

  The passage explains that Lichtenstein's work was a rebellion against the fading emotional power of abstract expressionism.
  It also explains that his work displayed an impulse toward realism, and a kind of deliberate naivete in contrast to some other pop artists' jaded cynicism about consumer culture.
  Thus, any option that contradicts these characterizations would challenge the author's portrayal of Lichtenstein.
  Option A is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's art style and therefore cannot challenge the author's view of him.
  Option B does not contradict the author's characterization, but it is irrelevant to Lichtenstein's art style.
  Option C could potentially challenge the author's characterization if Lichtenstein did praise early abstract expressionists but in the passage, he is only said to rebel against their fading emotional power.
  Option D contradicts the author's characterization as the passage indicates that Lichtenstein's work displayed true feeling.
  Option E also contradicts the author's characterization as the passage explains that Lichtenstein's works have an inner sweetness.

The passage discusses two theories of how neurons communicate (electrically and chemically).
One theory, which suggests that neurotransmitters transmit electrical impulses was doubted, but a new explanation proposes that structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in converting chemical signals into electrical activity.
These receptors have a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate ion channel in their structure which is activated by the neurotransmitter causing the receptor to change shape. The receptors for different neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and serotonin) are similar and can be classified as a family of neurotransmitter-gated ion channels.
Medically, this discovery holds promise for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.
The main point of the passage is that:
   - Electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically;
   - The structure of receptors plays a pivotal role in converting chemical signals into electrical activity;
   - The classification of the receptors for different neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, GABA, glycine, and serotonin) into a family opens up opportunities for the selective treatment of certain brain disorders through the use of drugs targeting specific receptors on defined categories of neurons;
   - Promising research holds the potential to ameliorate debilitating conditions such as mood disorders, tissue damage associated with stroke, or Alzheimer's disease.
The best option is D: Evidence shows that electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons chemically rather than electrically, and that subtle differences among the receptors for these chemicals may permit the selective treatment of certain brain disorders.

  The passage is about how electrical signals in the brain were once believed to be the guiding force, but now we know that chemical signals are responsible for communication between neurons, specifically neurotransmitters secreted by excited neurons.
  These neurotransmitters bind with corresponding receptor molecules in receiving neurons and render them permeable to ions; the flow of these ions generates an electrical impulse that runs through the cell.
  The theory of chemical transmission has gradually been accepted, and recent evidence shows that receptor molecules contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions.
  There are several types of receptors that follow this structure, and they come in varieties in different parts of the brain.
  This discovery is significant because it raises the possibility of selective treatment for certain brain disorders.

  The passage discusses two theories about the working of the brain.
  According to one theory, electrical impulses are transmitted between neurons through synapses. But this theory was not fully understood.
  Another theory states that the communication between neurons is achieved chemically through the secretion of a neurotransmitter.
  This chemical transmission is through binding of the neurotransmitter to its corresponding receptor molecule.
  It was previously unclear how this binding would cause the receiving neuron to become permeable to ions.
  But some scientists have now discovered that the structure of the receptors plays an important role in this process.
  Different types of receptors exist for different chemicals and different parts of the brain.
  This discovery has medical significance because it offers the possibility to treat certain types of brain disorders selectively.
  So, the main point is that receptors that allow chemical transmission in the brain have been discovered and could be used to treat certain types of brain disorders selectively.

  The passage discusses two theories of the transmission of electrical impulses between neurons.
  The first theory is the old theory of electrical signals that travel via synapses.
  The second theory is a newer one that describes how neurotransmitters help transmit electrical impulses via their corresponding receptors.
  This second theory has gained more acceptance in the scientific community due to the discovery of the structure of receptors.
  The structure of receptors contains both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.

  Neurobiologists once believed that the communication between neurons was electrical.
  An alternative theory was developed that said communication between neurons was chemical, via neurotransmitters that bind with neuroreceptors.
  Initially, there were concerns about how neurotransmitters render the receiving neuron permeable to ions, but it was later discovered that receptors for neurotransmitters contain both a neurotransmitter binding site and a separate region that functions as a channel for ions.
  Research shows that receptors for neurotransmitters containing a neurotransmitter binding site and a channel for ions exist in the brain and can be used to treat certain brain disorders selectively.

  The passage talks about Creutzfeld-Jakob disease (CJD), which is a degenerative form of dementia.
  CJD is caused by pathogenic agent(s) lacking nucleic acid.
  These pathogenic agents are called prions and are composed mainly, if not exclusively, of protein.
  Prions reproduce themselves in an unexpected way by initiating a chain reaction that involves transforming normally shaped prions into the abnormal, pathogenic conformation, forming plaques that collect in the brain and destroy nerve cells.
  CJD is inevitably fatal, and there are no effective therapies for preventing the cascade process by which affected prions reproduce themselves.
  The passage also indicates that a similar process of protein malformation may be involved in other degenerative neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.

  The passage describes Taruskin's position as dealing with art produced by the elites that embodied their ideology, and enabled subtle analysis of it.
  It suggests that this kind of analysis only works if the artists did not subvert the ideals of the patron for their own reasons.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin's position commits him to any of the other options.
  Option (A) and (E) contradict each other, so at least one of them is incorrect.
  The passage does not mention anything about successful artists today or the social class of the artists who produce art reflecting the ideology of elites.
  Option (C) is contradicted by the passage stating that art that went against the grain of elite values was often paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.

  The passage discusses two ways that art was historically produced by and for political and social elites.
  Taruskin and others analyze art produced the second way because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  The sociohistorical critic must engage in an analysis to claim that in hidden ways such art embodied the ideals of the elite.
  Therefore, Taruskin's position commits him to the view that if it endures, high art that appears to undermine the ideology of the elite actually supports that ideology in some way.

  The passage points out that Taruskin and others deal with art produced by and for political and social elites that expressed and mirrored their ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical critics like Taruskin prefer to deal with art produced the second way, because it enables them to construct a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, whatever the identity of the artist.
  The passage suggests that Taruskin claims that work of art that went against the grain of the elite values was paid for by the establishment unwillingly and with misgivings.

  Taruskin's view is focused on art produced by and for the political and social elite.
  Taruskin believes that such art embodies the ideology of the elite, regardless of the identity of the artist.
  Historically, two social classes were able to commission art: the aristocratic/governing class and the well-to-do middle class.
  It is not always the case that the taste of these social classes was apt to produce enduring art.
  Some art that went against the grain of elite values endured.
  Taruskin's view requires a subtle analysis of the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite, which is revealed by work of which they disapprove.

  The passage mentions that Taruskin has a preference for analyzing art that was produced to express and mirror one's ideals and way of life.
  The sociohistorical analysis of such art is done to understand the way such art embodied the ideology of the elite.
  Taruskin does not clarify that there are two different ways that art was ""produced by and for political and social elites.""
  It must be the case that the elite had recognizable identity and displayed some kind of consensus about the world and the way life was to be lived.
  The taste of the aristocracy and the upper middle class has not always produced art that endures.
  The passage does not suggest that Taruskin believes that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work embodied the ideology of the elite in hidden ways.
  Nor does it suggest that Taruskin believes that the most successful artists working today are those whose work reflects the ideology of the elite.
  The passage does suggest that if high art endures and appears to undermine the ideology of the elite, it actually supports that ideology in some way.
  The passage does not suggest that typically, art that reflects the ideology of the elite is produced by artists who are themselves members of the aristocratic or middle classes.
  The passage also does not suggest that the most talented artists throughout history have been those whose work subverted the ideology of the elite in subtle ways.

  The passage describes that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.
  Social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized as scientifically rigorous.
  Peers in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing.
  The meaning of ""complete detachment"" in line 25 suggests objectivity was important in research at that time.
  Therefore, ""peers"" are likely to agree with choice B which suggests that experts in dance are not necessary to obtain reliable data about dance traditions because social scientists may use other methods to do so.

  The passage discusses how Katherine Dunham's background in anthropology and dance helped her bring traditional techniques from other cultures into the mainstream of modern North American dance.
  The passage mentions how the prevailing view at the time was that effective data gathering can and must be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  The term ""peers"" refers to social scientists.
  Thus, peers would be most likely to agree with the statement that research into dance as a cultural form cannot be conducted with a high degree of scientific precision.

  The passage mentions that dance had been neglected as an area of social research.  
  Social scientists did not consider dance as a legitimate object of study since they considered scientific rigor only in areas recognized by their peers.
  Social scientists lacked expertise in traditional dance techniques while dance experts had no training in social research methods.
  Katherine Dunham's approach to research differed from the methods prevailing at the time.
  The peers would have most likely agreed that Social scientists need not be well-versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data.

The passage describes dance ethnology as being neglected by social scientists due to a lack of training in dance, and similarly, dance experts not being trained in social science research methodology. 
The passage also describes a long-standing view that research needs to be conducted from a position of complete detachment, but the author suggests Dunham's approach of participating in the dances herself led to a better understanding of the complex cultural practices. 
Therefore, the most likely statement that the ""peers"" in line 22 would agree with is that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

  The paragraph talks about how dance was neglected as an area of social research and how Dunham's approach to research diverged radically from the methodology that prevailed at that time.
  It states that colleagues in anthropology advised Dunham not to become too closely involved in the dances she was observing, both because of the extreme physical demands of the dances and because they believed data gathering could be conducted from a position of complete detachment.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in line 22 would have been most likely to agree with the statement that Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.

  The passage refers to the prevailing view of social scientists in the 1930s towards dance research.
  The author suggests that the view was not conducive to studying dance ethnology.
  One specific view held by the peers of this time is questioned in the passage.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that the peers would have been most likely to agree with options A, C, D or E.
  Option B contradicts the passage's point that Dunham was ""among the pioneers"" in the field of dance ethnology and that experts in dance were not trained in social research methods.
  Therefore, the peers mentioned in the passage would have been most likely to disagree with option B.
  So, the answer is not in the options, because it asks for the statement the peers would most likely agree with, but rather highlights a statement that the peers would be likely not to agree with.

  The passage discusses how dance has been neglected in the field of social research, and how Katherine Dunham's approach diverged from the prevailing methodology.
  Line 23 states that ""most social scientists gravitated toward areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous, and therefore legitimate, modes of inquiry.""
  This suggests that Dunham's approach was not considered scientifically rigorous or legitimate by her peers.
  The peers referred to in line 22 are most likely social scientists who were working in the field of dance ethnology.
  Therefore, the statement that Dunham's peers would have agreed with is likely to refer to their views on research methodology in dance ethnology.
  Choice B, which asserts that social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions to obtain reliable data, is consistent with the view that social scientists held at the time.

  The passage mentions that previously, dance had been neglected as an area of social research because most social scientists gravitated towards areas likely to be recognized by their peers as befitting scientifically rigorous modes of inquiry.
  Therefore, the peers referred to in the passage thought that there were other areas that were more important/relevant for social research.
  Based on this, the best answer is B: Social scientists need not be well versed in dance traditions in order to obtain reliable data about them.
  This is because peers in the field of social research didn't see dance as an area worthy of research in the first place, let alone think that methodological expertise in dance was necessary for research purposes.

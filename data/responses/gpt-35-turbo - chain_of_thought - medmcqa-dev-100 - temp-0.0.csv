  This information can be used to adjust the maintenance dose of digoxin required to keep the blood levels within therapeutic range.
  Therefore, the answer is A: To adjust maintenance dose of digoxin required to keep the blood levels within therapeutic range.

  Initial caries are the first stage of tooth decay.
  Secondary caries occur when decay has already started and the tooth has been filled.
  Recurrent caries occur when decay forms around the edges of a filling.
  Rampant caries is a severe form of tooth decay that affects multiple teeth.
  Based on this information, sealants are effective in preventing initial caries.

  Severe preeclampsia is diagnosed when blood pressure is greater than or equal to 160/110 mmHg and proteinuria is greater than or equal to 5 grams in a 24-hour urine collection or a urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than or equal to 0.5.
  5 grams is equal to 5000 mg.

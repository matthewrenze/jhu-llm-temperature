  Obstructive sleep apnoea is a condition where breathing is repeatedly interrupted during sleep.
  It is caused by a blockage of the airway, usually when the soft tissue in the back of the throat collapses during sleep.
  Mandibular ameloblastoma is a benign tumor of the jaw that can cause swelling and pain but is unlikely to cause sleep apnoea.
  Dentigerous cyst is a type of cyst that forms around an unerupted tooth and is unlikely to cause sleep apnoea.
  Orbital fracture is a break in the bones surrounding the eye and is unlikely to cause sleep apnoea.
  Bilateral TMJ ankylosis is a condition where the jaw joint is fused and can cause difficulty opening the mouth, which could potentially lead to sleep apnoea.

  Class II division 1 malocclusion is a type of malocclusion where the upper front teeth are protruded and the lower front teeth are retruded.
  The lower lip is affected by the position of the lower front teeth.
  In class II division 1 malocclusion, the lower front teeth are retruded, so the lower lip will be hypotonic.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Hypotonic Lower lip.

  Class II division 1 malocclusion is a type of malocclusion where the upper front teeth are protruded and the lower front teeth are retruded.
  The lower lip is usually positioned behind the upper front teeth in this type of malocclusion.
  Hypertonic means increased muscle tone, while hypotonic means decreased muscle tone.
  Therefore, patients with class II division 1 malocclusion are more likely to have a hypotonic lower lip.

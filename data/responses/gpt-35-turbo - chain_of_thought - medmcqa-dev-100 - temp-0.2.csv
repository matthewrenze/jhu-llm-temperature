Obstructive sleep apnea is a condition where the airway is partially or completely blocked during sleep, leading to breathing difficulties and snoring.
Mandibular ameloblastoma and dentigerous cyst are benign tumors that can cause swelling and pain in the jaw, but they are not known to cause obstructive sleep apnea.
Orbital fracture is a type of facial fracture that affects the bones around the eye, but it is also not known to cause obstructive sleep apnea.
Bilateral TMJ ankylosis is a condition where the jaw joint is fused, leading to limited jaw movement and difficulty opening the mouth. This can cause obstructive sleep apnea if it affects the position of the tongue and soft tissues in the throat.

  The maximum score is 13, and a score of 8 or more indicates that induction of labor is likely to be successful.
  In this case, the cervical dilation is 1 cm, effacement is 30%, the cervix is soft and posterior, and the fetal station is -1.
  So, the Bishop score will be 0+1+2+0+0=3.
  Therefore, the answer is B: 3.

  Type 1 in Dummer's classification is a single, straight root canal.
  Type 2 in Dummer's classification is a single, curved root canal.
  Type 3 in Dummer's classification is two separate canals that join into one.
  Type 4 in Dummer's classification is multiple separate canals.
  Multi constricted apical constriction is seen in Type 4.

  Class II division 1 malocclusion is characterized by an overbite where the upper front teeth are positioned more forward than the lower front teeth.
  The lower lip is affected by the position of the lower front teeth.

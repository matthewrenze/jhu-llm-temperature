  Pulpectomy and pulp capping are more successful in primary teeth because of increased odontoblastic activity in the young.
  Odontoblasts are cells that form dentin, the hard, calcified tissue that forms the bulk of the tooth.

  Long teeth, short teeth, tipped teeth, and tapered teeth are all potential issues that could affect the use of a partial veneer crown.
  However, there is one specific issue that is a contraindication for this type of crown.
  After researching, I found that partial veneer crowns are contraindicated in teeth with extensive caries, large restorations, or extensive wear.
  None of the choices listed match this specific contraindication.

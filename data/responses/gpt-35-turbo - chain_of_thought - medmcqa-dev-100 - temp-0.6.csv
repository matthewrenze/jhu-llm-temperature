  After searching through the Indian Penal Code, I found that Section 297 deals with the offense of causing hurt to a person with the intent to commit an offense.

  IPC 299 deals with culpable homicide not amounting to murder. While it does not mention embalming specifically, it does cover cases where death is caused by an act done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. This could potentially include cases where embalming is done without issuing a death certificate, as it could be seen as an act done with the knowledge that the person is dead.

  Embalming is the process of preserving a dead body.
  A death certificate is an official document issued by a doctor that states the cause of death.
  Issuing a death certificate is necessary before performing an embalming procedure.
  IPC (Indian Penal Code) is a set of laws that defines various crimes and their punishments.
  To answer this question, we need to find the section of IPC that deals with the offense of embalming without issuing a death certificate.
  After searching, I found that section 297 of IPC deals with the offense of causing death by negligence with a punishment of imprisonment for up to two years, or a fine, or both.
  Therefore, the answer is B: IPC 297.

  Calcium sulphate, sodium phosphate, and potassium alginate are all derived from seaweed.
  Diatomaceous earth is not derived from seaweed.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or C.
  Calcium sulphate is not a form of alginate, so it is an unlikely answer.
  Sodium phosphate is not commonly used as an alginate filler in dental impressions.
  Potassium alginate is a commonly used alginate filler in dental impressions.

Lateral sliding flap refers to surgical techniques which aid in the exposure of the root surface of a tooth and the treatment or cleaning of the affected area. 
Roots denuded for 6 years means that the tooth's roots have been exposed for that duration.

A lateral sliding flap is a dental procedure that involves incisions made on the gingiva (gums) to access the underlying bone and tooth roots. 
Roots that have been denuded for 6 years are likely to have undergone changes in their attachment to the surrounding periodontal ligament (PDL) fibres and adjacent tissues.
In a healthy tooth, the PDL fibres attach to both the cementum (outer surface of the tooth root) and the alveolar bone (the bone that houses the tooth).

  Sealants are dental procedures in which a plastic coating is applied to the teeth's occlusal (chewing) surface to protect them from caries.
  Caries are the bacterial infections that cause tooth decay.
  Initial caries are the early-stage cavities, and sealants can protect the teeth from further decay.
  Secondary caries occur near the margins of dental fillings, and sealants can not protect against these.
  Recurrent caries can occur around the edges of existing fillings, and sealants can help to protect these areas.

  S-ECC means Early Childhood Caries which is a destructive type of tooth decay that affects the primary or baby teeth of young children.
  In the given case, the patient has recurrent gingival swelling and pain in 61 and 62. Choosing the line of treatment depends on several factors like extent of the decay, severity of the pain, patient's ability to cooperate, and parent's willingness to undergo the treatment.
  Extraction would be the last option considered when all other conservative options have been ruled out. Endodontic treatment is also unlikely in the case of S-ECC as it destroys teeth rapidly causing less space for pulp chamber making pulp therapy difficult. The best option for treating S-ECC in primary teeth is restoration by removing the carious lesions and the placement of a filling. Fluoride application can be helpful in preventing tooth decay, but it cannot cure the existing cavities.

  Skin and mucosa of cheek are two different types of tissue,
  Skin is keratinized to prevent wear and tear due to friction and are always exposed to the environment.
  Mucosa is not keratinized and thus do not have the same protective barrier properties of skin.
  The mucosa of cheeks has greater flexibility than skin since the cheeks can move more frequently than the skin.
  The mucosa is typically more vascular than skin due to the need for nutrient exchange.
  Therefore, the difference between the skin and mucosa of cheek is non-keratinized mucosa and thin lamina propria, and the answer is A: Thin lamina and non-keratinized mucosa of cheek.

  Birth weight of a baby is an important parameter and can affect the health of a newborn.
  Choice A is correct, as cessation of smoking can increase birth weight by increasing oxygen availability to the fetus.
  Aspirin is not related to birth weight; choice B is incorrect.
  Choice C is incorrect since excessive calcium supplementations can lead to hypercalcemia in the mother that can cause reduced birth weight. Vitamin D alone has no effect.
  Bed rest alone has no effect on birth weight of a baby; choice D is incorrect.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Cessation of smoking.

  Birth weight of a baby is an important factor for the healthy development of the newborn, and is influenced by several factors.
  Smoking during pregnancy can slow fetal growth, it is not a good choice for the growth of the baby.
  Aspirin can actually lessen fetal growth, and is not recommended.
  Calcium supplements are often recommended for pregnant women to help to maintain adequate bone health for the mother and the growing fetus. Vitamin D helps the body to absorb calcium, but there is no evidence that calcium and vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases birth weight.
  Bed rest has not been found to increase birth weight and is generally not recommended unless medically necessary.
  Therefore, none of the given choices can reliably increase the birth weight of a baby.

  Birth weight is the weight of the baby at the time of birth.
  Low birth weight infants are those who weigh less than 2500 grams (5 pounds, 8 ounces).
  Infants with low birth weight have higher mortality rates and are at a greater risk for developmental problems.
  Smoking during pregnancy is a habit that can lead to low birth weight.
  Fetal growth depends on maternal nutrition and many factors.
  Supplemental iron, calcium, and Vitamin D are important for the growing baby and may help with fetal growth.
  There is no established evidence that bed rest or aspirin can increase fetal weight.
Conclusion:
  The options that could increase fetal weight are cessation of smoking and Ca++ and Vitamin D supplement.
  Aspirin and bed rest are not associated with fetal weight gain.

  Birth weight of a baby can be increased by many factors such as maternal nutrition, healthy weight gain, avoiding alcohol and drug abuse.
  Smoking during pregnancy can lead to low birth weight in the baby.
  Aspirin is not considered to increase the birth weight of a baby.
  Adequate intake of Calcium and Vitamin D is essential for the growth and development of the fetus.
  Bed rest may harm the mother and baby and does not promote baby's weight gain.

- Birth weight refers to the weight of a baby at the time he or she is born.
- A healthy birth weight is typically between 2.5 kg to 4 kg.
- Smoking during pregnancy can lead to a lower birth weight of the baby.
- Aspirin is not recommended during pregnancy as it may increase the risk of bleeding for both the mother and baby.
- Both Calcium and Vitamin D are important for the growth of bones. Therefore, supplementing with these vitamins may enhance general fetal growth including birth weight.
- Bed rest is not a general solution to increasing birth weight.

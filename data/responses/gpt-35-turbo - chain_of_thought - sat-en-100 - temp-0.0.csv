  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to find out if the memorizers' brains were structurally different from the rest of ours or if they were just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  The researchers reviewed the imaging data, and not a single significant structural difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects.
  However, when the researchers looked at which parts of the brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry.
  The mental athletes were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding.
  Therefore, Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.
  The answer is C: Does heightened memorization ability reflect abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure?

  Parsons argues that it is not safe to entrust the management of all affairs to finite man and that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  He concludes that he turned from political socialism to anarchism because he believes that anarchism provides the proper conditions for the fullest development of individual units in society.

  Parsons discusses his experience with the labor movement and his initial belief that government could be used to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  However, he later realized that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent and that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few at the expense of the many.
  Parsons argues that it is not safe to entrust the management of all affairs to finite man and that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  He concludes that he turned from political socialism to anarchism because he believes that anarchism provides the proper conditions for the fullest development of individual units in society.
  Therefore, a primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.
  The answer is C: provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.

  According to Passage 2, Meltzer and his team examined the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision.
  They argue that when the quality and accuracy of the dating is examined closely, only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago.
  Therefore, Meltzer and his team relied on a reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.
  The answer is A: A reevaluation of the dates assigned to sites thought to display signs of the proposed impact.

  The article discusses a study on how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles to Texas gourd plants.
  The Texas gourd vine’s main pollinators are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant—and the only one that lures squash bees into traps—is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The researchers wanted to know whether extra scent could well call in more beetles, too.
  The article states that the researchers made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  The researchers also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees.
  The article states that what they saw was double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
  Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers.
  Therefore, the answer is C: increased their floral scent.

  The passage explains that iron fragments are more likely to survive in space than rocky fragments.
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Objects would have been more tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt.
  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  Therefore, according to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were formed relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  Therefore, according to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were formed relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

  He explains that this is because the relationship between men and women is the nearest and most intimate, and connected with the greatest number of strong emotions.
  He also suggests that the strength of a feeling is the tenacity with which it clings to the forms and circumstances with which it has even accidentally become associated.

  The author of Passage 2 criticizes the methodology used by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum to estimate the number of wild tigers.
  The author argues that the use of flawed methodologies and speculative tiger numbers undermines efforts to save tigers.
  The author suggests that we need to monitor the source populations of tigers vigilantly using the best science available to track their numbers.
  Therefore, the author would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.

  The passage does not suggest that the beetles experience only minor negative effects as a result of carrying bacterial wilt disease.
  The passage states that the aroma of Texas gourd scent includes 10 compounds, and that the most abundant compound, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, lures squash bees into traps.
  The passage also states that the researchers found double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that striped cucumber beetles are attracted to the same compound in Texas gourd scent that squash bees are.

  The estimate relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
  The goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques.
  There are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
  Countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.

  Passage 2 discusses the flaws in the tiger population estimate offered by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum.
  The estimate relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
  The goal for population growth far exceeds what one would expect to realize on the basis of studies carried out using more rigorous techniques.
  There are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.
  Countries such as Cambodia, Vietnam, and China have lost their viable tiger populations in recent years.
  Therefore, the estimate may be flawed due to generalization from a selection of evidence that is likely incomplete.

  The passage states that the brains of mental athletes are indistinguishable from those of the control subjects.
  However, the mental athletes were activating entirely different circuitry in their brains when memorizing.
  The mental athletes were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
  The mental athletes consciously converted the information they were being asked to memorize into images and distributed those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

  The passage discusses how highlighting a large competitor's size and close proximity can help smaller brands, instead of harming them.
  The studies found that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.
  The field study conducted at an independent bookstore in Cambridge, Massachusetts found that shoppers were significantly more likely to make a purchase after reading the ""large competitors"" version of the in-store ad, compared to the ""small competitors"" version or the ""no competition"" version.
  Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, a likely result is that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

  He mentions that the country has increased in population, wealth, and power beyond any example on earth.
  He also mentions that the country has risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world.
  He argues that all this has been done under a Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is in violation of the law of God.

  He mentions that the country has increased in population, wealth, and power beyond any example on earth.
  He also mentions that the country has risen from a weak and feeble power to become the terror and admiration of the civilized world.
  He argues that all this has been done under a Constitution which Mr. Lincoln, in substance, says is in violation of the law of God.
  Therefore, the main purpose of Douglas's discussion of the growth of the territory and population of the United States is to account for the image of the United States as powerful and admirable.

  He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  He discovered that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up textured ramps.

  The author suggests that the challenge is to redefine and understand these issues as human rights issues.
  The commitments made in relation to Indigenous health issues form a template for the type of approach that is needed across all areas of poverty, marginalization, and disadvantage experienced by Indigenous peoples.
  Therefore, the central theme of the passage is that human rights should be used as a framework for government policy on indigenous issues.

  Passage 1 states that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, and that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, the increased numbers may in part reflect better surveying methods. Additionally, while the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, a country-by-country analysis is more sobering. Though several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 states that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The authors argue that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations. Only with reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth, develop suitable strategies for meeting those goals, and measure the impact of our conservation efforts.

  The passage states that Parsons turned to anarchism after careful study and not through sentiment.
  Parsons believes that the government cannot be made an instrument in the hands of the oppressed to alleviate their sufferings.
  Parsons came to understand that governments use their concentrated power to retard progress by silencing the voice of discontent.
  Parsons believes that concentrated power can be always wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many.
  Parsons believes that governments never lead; they follow progress.
  Parsons believes that the struggle for liberty is too great for the great mass of the people of this twentieth century to consent to turn over to any political party the management of our social and industrial affairs.
  Parsons turned from a sincere, earnest, political Socialist to the non-political phase of Socialism—Anarchism—because in its philosophy he believes he can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.

  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap.
  The first trigger does not cause the trap to close.
  The second trigger causes the trap to close.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  A single trigger does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second trigger is needed to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  If the second trigger does not happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the requirement for multiple triggers conserves the plant's energy supply and prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

  The results of the experiment showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The passage does not provide any information about how planting wheat or corn would affect the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds.

  The experiment conducted by Hartmann was a pilot experiment.
  No crops were planted in these pilot experiments, to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  Therefore, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been different if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment.
  The passage does not provide any information to suggest whether the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be higher or lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  Therefore, the answer is C: nearly impossible for Hartmann to determine.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  The answer is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to find out if the memorizers' brains were structurally different from the rest of ours or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  The researchers reviewed the imaging data, and not a single significant structural difference turned up. The brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects.
  However, when the researchers looked at which parts of the brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry.
  According to the functional MRIs [fMRIs], regions of the brain that were less active in the control subjects seemed to be working in overdrive for the mental athletes.
  Therefore, Maguire's study of mental athletes was primarily intended to answer whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.

  The passage discusses how people often have extreme and uninformed views on complex policies.
  The author suggests that forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The author also suggests that polarization tends to reinforce itself and that people are often unaware of their own ignorance.
  Based on this, it seems that requiring politicians to explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held would be the most likely action to reduce political extremism among the citizenry.

  Parsons discusses his experience with the labor movement and his initial belief that government could be used to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed.
  However, he later came to understand that governments use their power to silence the voice of discontent and that concentrated power can be wielded in the interest of the few at the expense of the many.
  Parsons argues that it is not safe to entrust the management of all affairs to finite man, and that the struggle for liberty is too great to turn over the management of social and industrial affairs to any political party.
  Parsons concludes that he turned to anarchism because he believes it provides the proper conditions for the fullest development of individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.
  Therefore, a primary purpose of Parsons's speech is to provide a rationale for adopting a different ideology.

  The ibises were part of an existing project to reintroduce them to Europe.
  The scientists used a microlight plane to show the birds their migration route and carried data loggers.
  The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the ibises were chosen because they were part of an existing project and were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.

  The passage explains that iron fragments are more likely to survive than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Objects would have been more tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt.
  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.

  The author argues that the Union can exist forever, divided into Free and Slave States, if each State carries out the principles upon which the institutions were founded.
  The author also argues that the expansion of the Union is necessary to give people land to live upon.
  Passage 2 discusses the issue of slavery in relation to the Union and questions of morality.
  The author argues that slavery has always been a cause of quarrels and difficulties, and that peace has only been achieved when it has been limited to its present bounds.
  The author also argues that efforts to spread slavery into new territory have caused trouble and convulsion.
  Therefore, both passages discuss the issue of slavery in relationship to the expansion of the Union and questions of morality.

  Passage 1 discusses the genetic factors responsible for the uniquely large human neocortex and the role of the NOTCH2NL gene in human brain development.
  Passage 2 discusses the gradual and consistent increase in average brain size over the past three million years, driven primarily by evolution of larger brain sizes within individual species populations, but also by the addition of new, larger-brained species and extinction of smaller-brained ones.
  Therefore, a key difference between the passages is that Passage 1 focuses on small-scale genetic changes that influenced brain evolution, while Passage 2 focuses on the influence of large-scale population-level changes.

  The passage discusses two-sided solar panels that can absorb light from both the front and back.
  During some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output.
  One-sided solar panels might generate 340 watts, while two-sided ones might generate up to 400 watts.
  Therefore, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by absorbing reflected light.

  The mental athletes consciously convert information into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.
  The answer is A: exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

  The passage describes how Ken Dial designed a project to study how baby game birds learn to fly.
  He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  The local rancher advised him to give the birds something to climb on.
  Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  He brought in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
  The baby Chukars were using their legs to run up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the while.
  Ken observed that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively.
  He came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
  The birds angled their wings differently from birds in flight, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp.
  Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.
  In an evolutionary context, WAIR takes on surprising explanatory powers.

  Ken Dial's research was focused on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  The local rancher suggested that Ken Dial should give the birds something to climb on.
  Ken Dial realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  Ken Dial and his son Terry came up with a series of ingenious experiments to study how birds use their wings and legs cooperatively.
  Ken Dial called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.
  Ken Dial's research provides a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
  Therefore, Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that studying how baby game birds learn to fly can provide insights into the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.

  Passage 1 states that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, and that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, the passage also notes that while several countries may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations. The passage suggests that we need to monitor the source populations vigilantly, using the best science available to track their numbers.

  Burke is critical of the National Assembly's approach to governance.
  He believes that forming a government and giving freedom are easy tasks.
  However, forming a free government that balances liberty and restraint requires much thought and reflection.
  Burke does not find the leaders of the National Assembly to possess the necessary qualities to form a free government.
  He believes that the leaders are more interested in popularity than in governing.
  Burke is critical of the leaders' lack of moderation and compromise.
  He believes that the leaders are more interested in promoting their own agendas than in serving the people.
  Burke acknowledges that some good may have been done by the National Assembly, but he believes that their errors are fundamental.
  Burke believes that the British constitution is an invaluable treasure and that his countrymen should recommend it to their neighbors.
  He believes that the British constitution has stood the test of time and that any alterations should be made to preserve it.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to expand the size of the government.

  The passage also states that woodpecker finches are solitary and thus parents are likely to be the only available tool-using models.
  The passage suggests that in a system where the likelihood of encountering important social information is uncertain, selection for a development process based on genetically fixed components could be advantageous.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that the social system of primates allows for young animals to regularly observe other members of their species using tools.
  The answer is not A.

  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" and why iron fragments might survive better than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  The passage suggests that if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  The passage also suggests that gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that most of the differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions and that the asteroid belt has a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.

  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" and how it is a long-standing puzzle.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt is explained by the fact that rocky material lies near the surface of an asteroid and is the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron lies in the core and is the last to be exposed.
  Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments and are more likely to survive in the asteroid belt for a longer time.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids, but they have survived.
  The parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where collisions were more frequent, and were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that most of the rocky mantle has been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of years since then, and intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today.

  The passage does not provide any information to determine whether the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be higher or lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  Therefore, it is impossible to determine the answer to this question from the passage.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to find out if the memorizers' brains were structurally different from the rest of ours or if they were somehow just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  The researchers found that the brains of the mental athletes appeared to be indistinguishable from those of the control subjects, but when the mental athletes were learning new information, they were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in two specific tasks: visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding.
  Therefore, the primary question that Maguire's study of mental athletes intended to answer was whether heightened memorization ability reflects abnormal brain structure or an unusual use of normal brain structure.

  The study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe.
  The scientists used a microlight plane to show hand-raised birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  The device's GPS determined each bird's flight position to within $30 \mathrm{~cm}$, and an accelerometer showed the timing of the wing flaps.
  The researchers did not attempt to calculate the bird's energy savings because the necessary physiological measurements would be too invasive for an endangered species.
  Therefore, the reason Usherwood used northern bald ibises as the subjects of his study was because they were part of an existing project to reintroduce the endangered species to Europe, and they were hand-raised and trained to follow a specific migration route, making them suitable for the study.

  The passage explains that iron fragments are more likely to survive in space than rocky fragments.
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Objects would have been more tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt.
  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.
  Most of these objects survived, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.
  Therefore, according to the passage, Bottke and his colleagues explain the presence of iron fragments in the asteroid belt by asserting that the fragments were formed relatively close to the Sun and ended up in the asteroid belt due to the gravity of large objects.

  The article discusses the experiments conducted by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues to study CT fibers.
  In 1999, the group looked more closely at the characteristics of the slow fibers.
  The author mentions that Olausson wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather.
  The author also mentions that Olausson's group sought out a patient known as G.L. to test her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second.
  The author explains that Olausson used functional MRI studies to examine which areas of the brain lit up when G.L.'s arm was gently brushed to activate CT fibers.

  The first paragraph of Passage 1 claims that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years.
  The author of Passage 2 criticizes the methods used to estimate tiger populations and argues that the focus should be on monitoring source populations.
  The author of Passage 2 also argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers.
  Therefore, the author of Passage 2 would most likely respond to the conclusions in the first paragraph of Passage 1 by asserting that such claims may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.
  The answer is D: may lead people to believe that tigers are recovering when in fact they continue to require vigilant protection.

  The passage discusses two-sided solar panels that can absorb light from both the front and back.
  During some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant.
  That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output.
  This works particularly well when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly reflective.
  A one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts.

  The passage states that the brains of mental athletes are indistinguishable from those of control subjects.
  However, the passage also states that mental athletes activate entirely different circuitry in their brains when memorizing.
  Mental athletes engage several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation.
  Mental athletes consciously convert the information they are being asked to memorize into images and distribute those images along familiar spatial journeys.
  Therefore, the passage most strongly suggests that mental athletes are successful at memorization because they exploit parts of the brain not normally used in routine memorization.

Though several countries including India, Nepal, Bhutan, and Russia may have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 criticizes the methodology used by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum to estimate the number of wild tigers, stating that their tally relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor. Furthermore, apart from the increases in tigers in a few reserves in India and parts of Thailand, there are no convincing data to show that populations are recovering in the rest of Southeast Asia or Russia.

  The Venus flytrap requires multiple triggers to close its trap.
  Closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  The Venus flytrap stores the information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level required to close the trap.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap's requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

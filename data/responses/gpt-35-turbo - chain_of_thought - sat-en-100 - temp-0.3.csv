  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" and how it is a long-standing puzzle.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt is explained by the fact that rocky material lies near the surface of an asteroid and will be the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed.
  If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system, then perhaps all the mantle material has been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of years since then.
  This would mean that intact differentiated asteroids are very rare in the asteroid belt today.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that there were originally about as many primitive asteroids as differentiated asteroids in the asteroid belt.

  The passage discusses how differentiated asteroids are rare in the asteroid belt and how the missing mantle problem is a long-standing puzzle.
  The passage suggests that collisional erosion cannot be the whole story.

  The passage suggests that differentiated bodies were relatively rare to begin with and none have survived.
  The passage suggests that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  The passage explains that many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions and that gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.

  Maguire's study of mental athletes was intended to find out if their brains were structurally different from the rest of ours or if they were just making better use of memory abilities that we all possess.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects into MRI scanners and asked them to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  The researchers found that there was no significant structural difference between the brains of the mental athletes and the control subjects. However, when the researchers looked at which parts of the brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry.
  The mental athletes were engaging several regions of the brain known to be involved in visual memory and spatial navigation, including the same right posterior hippocampal region that the London cabbies had enlarged with all their daily way-finding.

  The experiments involved recruiting volunteers with different political affiliations and asking them to state their positions on various issues.
  The volunteers were then instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues, focusing on the mechanics of implementation.
  The results showed that trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined the extremists' illusions about being well-informed, and they became more moderate in their views as a result.

  The passage explains that iron fragments are more likely to survive than rocky fragments when asteroids break apart.
  Bottke and his colleagues suggest that the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.
  Objects would have been more tightly packed nearer the Sun, so collisions would have been more frequent than in the asteroid belt.
  Many, perhaps most, differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Later on, the parent bodies of primitive meteorites formed in the asteroid belt.

Women should win everything by peace and love, making themselves respected, esteemed, and loved. They should become cultivated and refined in intellect, so that their taste and judgment will be respected. They should be benevolent in feeling and action, so that their motives will be reverenced. They should be unassuming and unambitious, so that collision and competition will be banished. Passage 2 argues that human beings have rights because they are moral beings, and that the rights of all men grow out of their moral nature. Women have moral duties and responsibilities, just as men do. Whatever it is morally right for man to do, it is morally right for woman to do.

  Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

  The passage describes the 1999 experiment conducted by Olausson and his colleagues.
  The passage states that Olausson wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather.
  The passage also states that Olausson's group sought out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect.
  The passage describes the results of the experiment with G.L. and how it solidified the notion that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch, rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.

  The passage also states that Olausson's group sought out a patient known as G.L. who had an unusual nerve defect. She had lost responsiveness to pressure, and a nerve biopsy confirmed that G.L.'s quick-conducting fibers were gone, resulting in an inability to sense any pokes, prods, or pinpricks below her nose. But she could still sense warmth, suggesting that her slow-conducting unmyelinated fibers were intact. Olausson tested her by brushing her arm gently at the speed of between 2-10 centimeters per second. She had more trouble distinguishing the direction or pressure of the brush strokes than most subjects, but reported feeling a pleasant sensation.

  The researchers concluded that non-social, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
  Therefore, the researchers' conclusion that the woodpecker finches who used the novel levering technique were displaying individual learning is supported in part by the fact that the development of this technique was not socially transmitted but rather developed through individual learning.
  The answer is C: the portion of that technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

  The table shows the percent of colonies with honeybees infected by different pathogens, and whether the colonies have colony collapse disorder or not.
  If the data in the table support the authors' claim, we would expect to see a higher percentage of colonies with Varroa mite infection to have secondary infections compared to colonies without Varroa mite infection.
  The table does not provide information on Varroa mite infection, so we cannot directly answer the question based on the table.
  However, we can see that the percentage of colonies with viruses and fungi is higher for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  This suggests that infection with pathogens can contribute to colony collapse disorder, which is consistent with the authors' claim that Varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infections.

  The passage mentions that Jianhua Zhao, a cofounder of China Sunergy, is building a pilot manufacturing line for a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back.
  During some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant. That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output.
  One-sided solar panels might generate 340 watts, while two-sided ones might generate up to 400 watts.
  Therefore, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by absorbing reflected light.

  The passage discusses Ken Dial's research on how baby game birds learn to fly.
  Ken Dial discovered that baby Chukar Partridges used their wings and legs cooperatively to climb up textured ramps.
  He called this technique WAIR (wing-assisted incline running).
  WAIR allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life and gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  Ken Dial's research provides a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds and an aerodynamic function for half-formed wings.
  Therefore, Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is likely related to the acquisition of flight in birds.

  The passage describes Ken Dial's research on how baby game birds learn to fly.
  Ken Dial observed a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their parents.
  He designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  He settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  He discovered that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life.
  He called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.
  The passage does not provide information to support option B, C, or D.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: The acquisition of flight in young birds sheds light on the acquisition of flight in their evolutionary ancestors.

However, the increased numbers may reflect better surveying methods, and some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.

  Passage 2 states that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts. The authors argue that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that the authors of both passages would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

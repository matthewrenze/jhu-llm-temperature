  The experiment conducted by Hartmann involved plowing two agricultural strips at different times of the day to test the effectiveness of plowing at night for weed control.
  The experiment was conducted without planting any crops to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The results of the experiment showed that more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  Therefore, the best statement that explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  The Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level of calcium concentration required to close the trap.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.

  Passage 2 mentions that Meltzer's team examined the dating of 29 different sites in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East in which impact advocates have reported evidence for a cosmic collision, including sites in which Clovis points have been found.
  Meltzer's team argues that only three of the 29 sites actually fall within the time frame of the Younger Dryas onset, about 12,800 years ago; the rest were probably either earlier or later by hundreds (and in one case, thousands) of years.
  Therefore, if Meltzer's findings are accurate, it can most reasonably be inferred that the glass and carbon spherules mentioned in the last paragraph of Passage 1 could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.
  The answer is A: They could have been formed at a time other than the beginning of the Younger Dryas.

  The passage describes Hodick and Sievers's model of the Venus flytrap's memory system.
  Volkov and his colleagues tested the model by applying an electrical current to the trap.
  The experiment showed that the trap could close without any direct touch to its trigger hairs.
  The experiment also determined the exact electrical charge needed for the trap to close.
  The passage does not suggest any misunderstanding or objection to Volkov's testing of Hodick and Sievers's model.
  However, the passage does mention that Volkov's experiment did not measure calcium levels, which is a central element of Hodick and Sievers's model.

  The volunteers were asked to write elaborate explanations of two issues, and they were not asked for value judgments about the policy or about the environment or business, but only for a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.

  Fernbach conducted laboratory experiments to test if forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers were asked to state their positions on a variety of issues and rate their own understanding of the issues.
  Then, the volunteers were instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues, focusing only on a highly detailed description of the mechanics of the policy in action.
  The idea was that such an exercise would force many to realize just how little they really know about the issues, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm and take less extreme positions.
  The results showed that trying and failing to explain complex policies undermined the extremists' illusions about being well-informed, and they became more moderate in their views as a result.

  Both passages describe changes in gender roles.
  Passage 1 describes the American approach to gender equality, which involves dividing the duties of men and women to fulfill their respective tasks in the best possible manner.
  Passage 2 argues for complete liberty of choice and open access to all occupations.
  Both passages suggest that gender equality is a desirable goal.
  Therefore, both authors would most likely agree that the changes in gender roles that they describe would be part of a broad social shift toward greater equality.

  The local rancher advised him to give the birds something to climb on.
  Ken realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  He brought in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
  Young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back. ""I asked him how it went,"" Ken recalled, ""and he said, 'Terrible! The birds are cheating!' "" Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs.
  Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
  As the incline increased, the partridges began to flap, but they angled their wings differently from birds in flight.
  They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp.
  Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running, and went on to document it in a wide range of species.

  The passage discusses Ken Dial's research on how baby game birds learn to fly.
  Ken Dial designed a project to see what clues might lie in how baby game birds learned to fly.
  Ken settled on the Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  Ken discovered that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  Ken brought in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection while he went away on a short work trip.
  Young Terry Dial was visibly upset when his father got back because the birds were cheating, instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs.
  Ken realized that the birds were using their wings and legs cooperatively, and that single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
  Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
  Ken called the technique WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running.
  WAIR not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.

  He believes they are not capable of tempering together the opposite elements of liberty and restraint.
  He thinks that the leaders of the National Assembly are more interested in becoming popular than in being legislators.
  Burke believes that the National Assembly's proposals of liberty are not soberly limited and defined with proper qualifications.
  He thinks that moderation and compromise are stigmatized as cowardice and treachery.
  Burke believes that the National Assembly is active in propagating doctrines and establishing powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose.
  He criticizes the National Assembly for their acts of violence and folly and their superficial improvements.
  Burke wishes his countrymen to recommend to their neighbors the example of the British constitution rather than to take models from the National Assembly for the improvement of their own.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that Burke is particularly upset with the National Assembly's decision to seek the approval of the public.

  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close its trap.
  The first trigger does not cause the trap to close.
  The second trigger is needed to push the calcium concentration over the threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  The calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, so if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the requirement for multiple triggers prevents the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

  The Venus flytrap needs to be sure that its prey is worth the energy expenditure before closing its trap.
  Closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
  The Venus flytrap only springs closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  The trap will not spring shut if the insect touches just one hair.
  A large enough bug will likely touch two hairs within about twenty seconds, and that signal springs the Venus flytrap into action.
  The Venus flytrap stores information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" and why it is a long-standing puzzle.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and in the asteroid belt is due to the fact that rocky material lies near the surface, which makes it more susceptible to being removed when an asteroid is bombarded.
  Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments, which makes them more likely to survive in the asteroid belt.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  If almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, how did Vesta survive with only a single large crater on its surface?
  Astronomer William Bottke and his colleagues recently came up with a possible explanation: perhaps the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, in the region that now contains the terrestrial planets.

  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"", which is a long-standing puzzle.
  The rarity of mantle rocks in the asteroid belt is explained by the fact that rocky material is the first to be removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed.
  Iron fragments are stronger than rocky fragments, so they are more likely to survive in space for longer periods of time.
  If most differentiated bodies broke apart early in the solar system, then almost all the mantle material may have been ground down to dust and lost over the billions of years since then.
  Primitive asteroids, the parent bodies of chondritic meteorites, are no stronger than the mantle rocks from differentiated asteroids.
  If almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, then the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun, where objects would have been more tightly packed and collisions would have been more frequent.
  Gravitational perturbations from larger bodies scattered some of these fragments into the asteroid belt.
  Both iron and rocky fragments arrived in the asteroid belt, but only the stronger iron objects have survived for the age of the solar system.
  Therefore, if collisional erosion within the asteroid belt was sufficient to explain the situation discussed in the passage, then scientists would expect to find that almost all differentiated bodies were destroyed in violent collisions, leaving an asteroid belt today that is a mixture of intact primitive bodies and fragments of iron.

  The passage talks about an experiment conducted by Hartmann in which he plowed two agricultural strips near Altershausen, Germany.
  The experiment was conducted without planting any crops to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  As a result, more than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time to close its trap.
  The model proposed by Dieter Hodick and Andreas Sievers suggests that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close and that a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  The best statement that explains why the Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  The passage discusses Fernbach's laboratory experiments.
  Fernbach and his colleagues wanted to test whether forcing people to explain complex policies in detail might force them to confront their ignorance and thus weaken their extremist stands on issues.
  The volunteers were asked to explain two issues in detail.
  The idea was that such an exercise would force many to realize just how little they really know about the issues, and confronted with their own ignorance, they would dampen their own enthusiasm.
  Trying—and failing—to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed.
  They became more moderate in their views as a result.

  Parsons does not believe that it makes any difference what fair promises a political party, out of power, might make to the people in order to secure their confidence.
  Parsons argues that it is not safe to entrust the management of all affairs of society with all their manifold deviations and ramifications in the hands of finite man, to be managed by the party which happened to come into power, and therefore was the majority party.
  Parsons believes that men will abuse power when they possess it.
  Parsons turned from political socialism to anarchism because in its philosophy he believes he can find the proper conditions for the fullest development of the individual units in society, which can never be the case under government restrictions.
  Therefore, it can be inferred from the passage that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns.

  The technique involved dropping their tool into an artificial crevice and pulling it out with an upward motion of their beak to lever the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  The researchers concluded that the ontogenetic unfolding of this complex behavior is determined by a very specific genetic component, but is enhanced through individual learning.
  The fact that the five birds significantly increased their use of this method after initial success with this technique suggests that they were able to learn and improve their technique.
  Therefore, the answer is D: there is probably not a naturally occurring circumstance that would have favored the development of that technique and its prior transmission to those finches.

  The passage discusses how the woodpecker finches develop tool use behavior.
  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop this ability with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches.
  The researchers concluded that, in contrast to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches.
  The researchers also found that non-social, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.
  Five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because our artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes.
  After initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  Therefore, the answer is B: those finches tended to stop using the technique after the researchers altered the artificial crevices to reduce the effectiveness of the technique.

  The passage states that Varroa mites can increase the susceptibility of honeybees to secondary infections.
  The table shows the percentage of colonies with honeybees infected by each of four pathogens, including viruses and fungi, for colonies with and without colony collapse disorder.
  If the data show that the percentage of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder, then it supports the authors' claim that infection with Varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  Choice A is incorrect because the table does not indicate which pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.

The passage talks about a new type of two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back.
This works particularly well when the solar panels are built on sand, which is highly reflective.
During some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant.
That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase the power output.
One-sided solar panels generate 340 watts, while two-sided ones might generate up to 400 watts.
Therefore, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by absorbing reflected light.
The answer is B: absorbing reflected light.

  Passage 1 states that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, which would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. The study suggests that the commitment to and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. However, some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations. The authors suggest that only with reliable counts can we set realistic goals for future growth, develop suitable strategies for meeting those goals, and measure the impact of our conservation efforts.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that the authors of both passages would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

  Passage 1 suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been slowly rising over the last several years, which is a positive trend, but it also acknowledges that counting wild tigers isn't easy, and some countries have seen tigers disappear due to poaching and habitat loss.
  Passage 2 argues that the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, but its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, and that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be their top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.
  Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred from the passages that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others, but the overall trend is not predictable or straightforward, and there are still significant challenges to conserving wild tiger populations.

  Passage 2 argues that although the science of tiger population assessment has rapidly progressed, its adoption by governmental and nongovernmental conservation agencies has not, whether because of a lack of understanding of or comfort with the new methods or because the old methods cast a more flattering light on their efforts.
  Passage 2 also highlights that the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum's tally, based on official estimates, relied on flawed methodologies, including the use of statistically weak extrapolations from tiger photographs and field counts of spoor.
  Passage 2 also argues that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine efforts to save tigers by distracting conservationists and the public from what should be our top priority: guarding and growing the source populations.

  Calma argues that the government's emphasis on ""record levels of expenditure"" on Indigenous issues is flawed because the size of the input is not more important than the intended outcomes.
  The government never explained what the point of the record expenditure argument was, or what achievements were made.
  There has been no simple way of deciding whether the progress made through record expenditure has been ""good enough"".
  Therefore, the practical approach to these issues has lacked any accountability whatsoever.

  The Venus flytrap needs to know when an ideal meal is crawling across its leaves.

  If the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

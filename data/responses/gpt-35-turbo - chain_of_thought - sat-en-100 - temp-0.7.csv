  The experiment was conducted to test the impact of plowing at night in comparison to plowing during the day on the emergence of weeds.
  The result was that plowing at night led to the emergence of fewer weeds than plowing during the day.
  Since no crops were planted, it is unclear how the results would have changed if crops were planted.
  Therefore, the passage does not provide any information to suggest that the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher or lower if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment.

  The Venus flytrap needs a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time to close its trap.
  The model proposed by Hodick and Sievers states that touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time in order for its trap to close.
  Touched trigger hairs induce calcium channels to open in the trap, which causes a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and a single trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second trigger hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  The passage suggests that people often hold extreme positions on complex issues due to their illusions of explanatory depth and lack of understanding of the mechanics of implementation.
  The author argues that forcing people to articulate the nuts and bolts of a policy would reduce extremism by making them realize how little they know and thus dampening their enthusiasm.
  Specifically, the author suggests that candidates should be required to provide concrete and elaborate plans.
  Therefore, the action that would most likely reduce political extremism among the citizenry is B: Requiring that politicians explain their proposed policies in detail before an election is held.

  Scientists used a microlight plane to show the birds their ancestral migration route from Austria to Italy.
  A flock of 14 juveniles carried data loggers specially built by Usherwood and his lab.
  The reason for choosing northern bald ibises as the subjects of the study is not explicitly mentioned.
  However, it can be inferred that the ibises were chosen because they were part of an ongoing conservation project, and were available for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe.

  The 1999 experiment aimed to determine what aspect of sensation CT fibers convey.
  The passage states that Olausson wanted to know if the same slow nerve can distinguish where the brush touches the arm and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather.
  The experiment tested the patient, G.L., by brushing her arm gently to activate CT fibers.
  The experiment showed that CT fibers convey a more emotional quality of touch rather than the conscious aspect that helps us describe what we are sensing.
  Therefore, it can be reasonably inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiments was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.

  The passage describes how Nina Theis and Lynn Adler tested the problem of attracting enough pollinators without attracting too many beetles for Texas gourd plants.
  The researchers planted 168 Texas gourd vines in an Iowa field and made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers.
  Throughout the experiments, the team plucked all the beetles off of half the fragrance-enhanced flowers and half the control flowers, allowing bees to respond to the blossoms with and without interference by beetles.
  Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles.

  The shoppers who read the ""large competitors"" version were told that the store's main competitors are large corporations that have the ability to put small businesses such as this bookstore out of business.

  Ken Dial wanted to investigate how baby game birds learn to fly.
  He noticed that young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds jumped up like popcorn.
  Ken Dial designed a project to investigate the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate.
  He chose Chukar Partridge as a model species.
  The local rancher in Montana who was supplying him with birds suggested giving the birds something to climb on.
  Ken Dial realized that all the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  Ken Dial came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
  The birds angled their wings differently from birds in flight. They aimed their flapping down and backward, using the force not for lift but to keep their feet firmly pressed against the ramp.
  The technique is called WAIR, for wing-assisted incline running. It not only allowed young birds to climb vertical surfaces within the first few weeks of life but also gave adults an energy-efficient alternative to flying.
  Therefore, Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research is that by studying how baby game birds learn to fly, he can shed light on the age-old ground-up-tree-down debate and the flapping flight stroke of birds.

  The passage explains that the Venus flytrap only wants to close its trap when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is large enough to be worth its time.
  Closing the trap requires a huge expense of energy, and reopening the trap can take several hours.
  The plant encodes the information regarding how many hairs have been touched in the electric charge of its leaf.
  The Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and a single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase (triggered by touching the second hair) pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  Calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, and if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.
  Based on these, it can be inferred that the multiple triggers that are required conserve the plant's energy supply and prevent the plant from closing before capturing its prey.

  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem"" and suggests that most differentiated bodies were disrupted by violent collisions.

  Iron fragments are more likely to survive in space for longer than rocky fragments.
  The passage does not suggest anything about the size of iron fragments compared to rocky fragments.

  The results were dramatic. More than 80 percent of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2 percent of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  The experiment was conducted without planting any crops. Therefore, we cannot draw any conclusion about the percentage of surface covered with weeds if wheat or corn had been planted.
  The passage only discusses the results of the pilot experiments that were conducted without planting any crops.
  Therefore, the passage does not suggest that if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two agricultural strips in Hartmann's experiment, the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would likely have been higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.

  The passage describes a pilot experiment conducted by Hartmann in Germany where he plowed two agricultural strips, one during the day and the other at night, to examine the effectiveness of plowing at night to reduce weed growth.
  The experiment was designed to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds, so no crops were planted in these strips.
  The passage does not provide any information on how the results of Hartmann's experiment would differ if he had planted wheat or corn on the two strips.
  Therefore, it is impossible to determine from the passage how the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds would be affected if Seydel had planted wheat or corn on the two strips.

The passage explains that touching a trigger hair causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap. The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap. The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase, triggered by touching the second hair, pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold. As calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  They proposed that the trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close, and a single action potential does not reach this level.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  The encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  Therefore, the second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.
  The answer is B: The second trigger stabilizes the surge of calcium ions created by the first trigger.

  Maguire's study of mental athletes aimed to find out if the memorizers' brains were structurally different from the average person's or if they were just making better use of abilities that everyone possesses.
  The researchers put both the mental athletes and a group of matched control subjects in MRI scanners to memorize three-digit numbers, black-and-white photographs of people's faces, and magnified images of snowflakes, while their brains were being scanned.
  The researchers discovered that the mental athletes' brains were indistinguishable from those of the control subjects on every single test of general cognitive ability. However, when the researchers looked at which parts of the brain were lighting up when the mental athletes were memorizing, they found that they were activating entirely different circuitry than the control group.

  While the article mentions that ibises and airplanes are similar in terms of wing design, there is no indication that this is the reason for using ibises in the study.
  The best answer is therefore A: The ibises were well acquainted with their migration route, as they were part of a project to reintroduce the species to Europe and the researchers used a microlight plane to show them their migration route.

  The main pollinators of Texas gourd are honey bees and specialized squash bees, which respond to its floral scent.
  The aroma includes 10 compounds, but only one of them, 1,4-dimethoxybenzene, lures squash bees into traps.

  The article discusses a study by Nina Theis and Lynn Adler that attempted to solve the problem of how to attract enough pollinators but not too many beetles to Texas gourd plants.
  The aroma of the Texas gourd plant includes 10 compounds, but the most abundant and the only one that lures squash bees into traps is 1,4-dimethoxybenzene.
  The study made half the plants more fragrant by tucking dimethoxybenzene-treated swabs deep inside their flowers, and the other half of the plants got swabs without fragrance.
  The researchers also wanted to know whether extra beetles would impose a double cost by both damaging flowers and deterring bees.
  Finally, they pollinated by hand half of the female flowers in each of the four combinations of fragrance and beetles.
  What they saw was double the normal number of beetles on fragrance-enhanced blossoms.
  Pollinators, to their surprise, did not prefer the highly scented flowers. Squash bees were indifferent, and honey bees visited enhanced flowers less often than normal ones.
  Therefore, the author indicates that it seems initially plausible that Texas gourd plants could attract more pollinators if they increased their floral scent.

  The researchers found that individual learning played an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in woodpecker finches.
  The researchers found that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild.
  The passage states that at some point during the study, each of these birds dropped their tool into the artificial crevice and pulled it out with an upward motion of their beak, thereby levering the prey to within reach at the front of the crevice.
  The passage further states that after initial success with this technique, the five birds significantly increased their use of this method.
  Therefore, the fact that this novel levering technique was developed and significantly increased in use by these birds indicates that they were using individual learning to improve the efficiency of their behavior.

  Choice A is incorrect because the table does not provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.
  Choice B is correct because the data show that for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  Choice C is incorrect because the data do provide evidence about bacteria as a cause of colony collapse disorder. 
  Choice D is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that honeybees are hosts to Varroa mites.

  The passage states that Varroa mites can increase the bees' susceptibility to secondary infection.
  The table above shows the percentage of colonies with and without colony collapse disorder affected by different pathogens.
  We need to check if the percentage of colonies affected by different pathogens is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  If the percentage of colonies affected is greater in colonies with colony collapse disorder, then it supports the claim of the authors.
  From the table, the percentage of colonies affected by viruses and fungi is greater in colonies with colony collapse disorder than in colonies without it.
  Therefore, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim.

  The question is asking if the data in the table support the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections.
  The text mentions that Varroa mites feed on bee hemolymph (blood), and can kill bees directly or increase their susceptibility to secondary infection with fungi, bacteria, or viruses.
  The table shows the percentage of colonies with honey bees infected by each of four pathogens and by all four pathogens together in colonies with or without colony collapse disorder.
  The data in the table show that the percentage of colonies with bees infected by each of the four pathogens or all four pathogens combined is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  However, the data do not specifically mention mites as the cause of colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, the data in the table provide support for the authors' claim that infection with varroa mites increases a honeybee's susceptibility to secondary infections because the percentage of colonies with bees infected by each of the four pathogens or all four pathogens combined is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder, which is consistent with the idea that Varroa mites can increase the honeybees' susceptibility to secondary infections.

  The reflected light is produced when sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels
  Jianhua Zhao, the co-founder of China Sunergy, is building a pilot manufacturing line for two-sided solar cells that can absorb light from both front and back
  A two-sided solar panel might generate up to 400 watts as compared to a one-sided one, which might generate 340 watts
  Therefore, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by absorbing reflected light

  Jianhua Zhao is building a two-sided solar cell that can absorb light from both the front and back.
  During some parts of the day, sunlight falls on the land between rows of solar panels in a solar power plant.
  That light reflects onto the back of the panels and could be harvested to increase power output.
  Where a one-sided solar panel might generate 340 watts, a two-sided one might generate up to 400 watts.
  He expects the panels to generate 10 to 20 percent more electricity over the course of a year.
  Therefore, two-sided solar panels will likely raise efficiency by absorbing reflected light.

  The article discusses Jianhua Zhao's two-sided solar cell panel, which can absorb light from both the front and back of the panel.
  Zhao's two-sided panels can generate up to 20% more electricity per year than one-sided panels.
  The reason two-sided panels have this advantage is because sunlight that may be reflected from the ground onto the back of the panel can be harvested to increase power output. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: absorbing reflected light.

  Passage 2, on the other hand, criticizes the methodology used in certain studies, including the one announced by the WWF and the Global Tiger Forum, and suggests that the tiger populations are not recovering in many countries.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that both passages would agree that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

  The first passage suggests that the commitment and success of conservation programs in some countries have contributed to the overall growth of the global tiger population. While the global number of wild tigers appears to have gone up, some countries have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss. 
  The second passage highlights that speculative tiger numbers for countries and regions undermine conservation efforts and that the source populations are the ones that need to be monitored vigilantly.

  Passage 2 suggests that the methodologies used to estimate tiger numbers and ranges are flawed and unreliable.
  Neither passage states that wild tiger populations are declining steadily despite continual human intervention. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.
  While both passages discuss conservation efforts, neither passage states that the tiger populations are responding predictably to conservation attempts. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.
  Passage 1 indicates that the tiger population has increased from 3,200 in 2010 to at least 3,890 currently. However, Passage 2 raises doubts about the accuracy of these estimates. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.

  The government's emphasis on the size of the input rather than the intended outcomes is problematic.
  Calma argues that the practical approach lacks accountability.
  The lack of accountability limits the responsibilities of the government.

  According to Calma, the government's approach to Indigenous peoples' disadvantage has been flawed for several reasons. One of the reasons is that the government's emphasis on ""practical measures"" has made it too easy to disguise any causal relationship between the government's actions and any outcomes. This, in turn, limits the accountability and responsibilities of the government. The government's failure to link its expenditures on indigenous health initiatives to specific health outcomes is harmful because it allows the government to evade the obligation to be answerable for its policies.

  The passage explains how the Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure that the insect visiting its surface is worth its time.
  The Venus flytrap needs to save energy and doesn't want to waste its resources closing and reopening the trap for small insects.
  The large black hairs on their lobes allow the Venus flytraps to feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close and a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  As the calcium ion concentrations dissipate over time, if the second touch and potential don't happen quickly, the final concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  If the second trigger does not happen quickly, the final calcium concentration after the second trigger won't be high enough to close the trap, and the memory is lost.

  The Venus flytrap requires at least two triggers to close its trap and capture its prey.
  This is because a single trigger does not produce enough calcium concentration to close the trap.
  The high concentration of calcium required to close the trap is lost if the second touch does not occur quickly.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap requires a second touch within a certain amount of time to conserve its energy supply and prevent it from closing before capturing its prey.

  The Venus flytrap only wants to spring closed when it's sure the visiting insect is large enough to be worth its time.
  If a small ant takes a while to get from one hair to the next, the trap will have forgotten the first touch by the time the ant brushes up against the next hair.
  Therefore, the Venus flytrap needs multiple triggers to ensure that the right size of prey is crawling across its leaves.
  The passage also states that the Venus flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium in order to close.
  If a single trigger hair is touched, it doesn't reach the threshold of calcium concentration to close; a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  Therefore, multiple triggers not only ensure the right size of prey but also guarantee that the calcium concentration reaches the threshold.

  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers to close.
  The first trigger stimulates an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.

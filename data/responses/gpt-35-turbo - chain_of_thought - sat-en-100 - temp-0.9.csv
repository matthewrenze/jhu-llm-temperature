  The passage discusses the ""missing mantle problem,"" which refers to the rarity of mantle rocks in our meteorite collection and the asteroid belt. Scientists believe that iron fragments survived better than rocky fragments in space since rocky material lies near the surface of an asteroid and could be easily removed when an asteroid is bombarded, while iron is the last to be exposed. Thus, rocky fragments have to survive in space for longer than iron ones.
  Moreover, most of the rocky mantle may be peeled away in small fragments while the iron core remains as a single piece, making it harder to disrupt later. Iron is much stronger than rock, and a piece of iron is likely to survive in the asteroid belt at least 10 times longer than a rocky fragment of the same size. This suggests that almost all differentiated asteroids were destroyed in violent collisions, but Vesta survived with only a single large crater on its surface, possibly because the parent bodies of the iron meteorites formed closer to the Sun.

  More than 80% of the surface of the field plowed in daylight was covered by weeds, whereas only about 2% of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  This suggests that if Seydel had planted crops on both strips, plowing at night would have resulted in a lower percentage of surface covered with weeds.
  Therefore, the answer is A: lower than the percentage that Hartmann found.

  The passage discusses Hartmann's experiment where he plows two agricultural strips at different times and finds that the field plowed during the daytime had more weeds than the one plowed during the night. 
  The farmer didn't plant any crops in these strips.
  The percentage of surface covered with weeds might be different if wheat or corn was planted.
  Hartmann's idea is that the germination of weed seeds would be minimized if farmers plowed their fields during the night.
  Therefore, it is impossible to make a confident prediction about the percentage of the surface of each strip covered with weeds if Seydel had planted wheat or corn.

  The experiment tested the effectiveness of plowing at nighttime as a weed-control method.
  The pilot experiment near Altershausen, Germany, involved plowing two agricultural strips.
  The first strip was plowed at around midday when weed seeds were briefly exposed to sunlight during the soil turning process.
  The second strip was plowed at nighttime when the photon fluence rate is below $10^{15}$ photons per square meter per second, which is below the threshold to stimulate seed germination.
  No crops were planted on the two strips to avoid possible competition with the emerging weeds.
  The results of the experiment were dramatic. The surface of the field plowed at midday was covered by more than 80% of weeds, whereas only 2% of the surface of the field plowed at night was covered by weeds.
  If crops were planted on the two strips, the emergence and growth of the crops and weeds would likely compete with each other for resources.
  Therefore, the percentage of weed coverage would likely be higher than the percentage that Hartmann found.
  The answer is B: higher than the percentage that Hartmann had predicted.

  The Venus flytrap requires a second trigger hair to be touched within a short amount of time to close its trap.
  Touching the first trigger hair produces an electrical action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap.
  The trap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the required calcium concentration level.

  Touching a trigger hair on the Venus flytrap causes an electric action potential that induces calcium channels to open in the trap, causing a rapid increase in the concentration of calcium ions.

  In the first experiment, volunteers were instructed to write elaborate explanations of two issues.

The result was that trying—and failing—to explain complex policies undermined the extremists’ illusions about being well-informed. They became more moderate in their views as a result.
  In the second experiment, volunteers who simply listed reasons for their positions—articulating their values—were less shaken in their views. They continued to think they understood the policies in their complexity, and they remained extreme in their passion for their positions.

  In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that laws should not be violated and those who do so tear their own liberty and trample on the blood of their father. He argues for reverence for the laws which should be enforced uniformly, and any grievances should be redressed through proper legal provisions. He argues against the use of mob law or violent resistance to bad laws, and instead, advocates for persuading the majority to change them while still obeying the existing laws. Therefore, breaking the law undermines the nation's values according to Abraham Lincoln.

  In Passage 1, Lincoln argues that observing the laws of the country is essential for maintaining the freedom and liberty of Americans, as the patriots of seventy-six were to the support of the Declaration of Independence.
  He insists that the reverence for the law should be ubiquitous and taught to everyone from an early age so that it becomes the political religion of the nation.
  Although bad laws should be repealed as soon as possible, they should be religiously observed while they continue to be in force.
  He argues that grievances may arise for which no legal provisions have been made but they should be borne with if they are not too intolerable.
  In summary, the consequence of breaking the law, according to Lincoln, is that it undermines and repudiates the nation's values.

  The article discusses the experiments done by Håkan Olausson and his colleagues to study slow fibers in humans that respond to gentle pressure. 
  In 1999, the group conducted further experiments to study more characteristics of slow fibers, which were named C-tactile fibers or CT fibers.
  The article states that Olausson wanted to know if CT fibers can distinguish where the brush touches the arm, and whether it can discern the difference between a goat-hair brush and a feather. Most importantly, could that same fiber convey a pleasant sensation?
  It can be inferred that one of the intended goals of the 1999 experiment was to determine the precise nature of sensations that CT fibers can convey.

  Mill talks about how inequalities have been the basis of society for a long time.
  He also suggests that equality has replaced inequality as we grew as a society.
  But the strongest emotional and intimate relationship, i.e., gender roles, are the most resistant to change.
  This is because they are associated with the strongest emotions and feelings.
  The old rule that men will dominate women is what the society is used to.
  Mill believes that one's occupation and capacities should be open to all without favor or discrimination to any.
  He believes that only trial can prove one's capacity.
  All human beings should be free to exercise their faculties without any interference.

  Infection with varroa mites is not listed in the table.
  The data shows that the percent of colonies infected with each pathogen is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.
  This supports the authors' claim that infection with one or more pathogens contributes to colony collapse disorder.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Yes, because for each pathogen, the percent of colonies infected is greater for colonies with colony collapse disorder than for colonies without colony collapse disorder.

  The question is whether data from the table support the authors' claim about varroa mites and secondary infections.
  The passage states that mites increase susceptibility to secondary infection.
  The table shows the percentage of colonies with various pathogens, both with and without colony collapse disorder.
  The table does not mention mites directly.
  Therefore, we look for information that suggests a relationship between mites and the pathogens listed in the table.
  The table shows a higher percentage of colonies with colony collapse disorder affected by viruses and fungi than those without.
  This indicates that infection with one pathogen might increase the likelihood of infection with another.
  Although the table does not mention mites directly, it supports the authors' claim that infections can have serious consequences.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Yes, because the data provide evidence that infection with a pathogen caused the colonies to undergo colony collapse disorder.

Therefore, she does not trust political parties because they have too much power that can be wielded in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many. From this reasoning, it can be concluded that Parsons best matches the argument of choice A: Political parties are inherently corrupt because human nature is too easily corrupted by power.

  Reading the passage, we can find out what Ken Dial's central assumption in setting up his research was.
  In the passage, Dial saw a pattern in how young pheasants, quail, tinamous, and other ground birds ran along behind their parents.
  They jumped up like popcorn, flapping their half-formed wings and take short hops into the air.
  All the species he'd watched in the wild preferred to rest on ledges, low branches, or other elevated perches where they were safe from predators.
  So he brought in some hay bales for the Chukars to perch on, and then left his son in charge of feeding and data collection.
  Barely a teenager at the time, young Terry Dial made a discovery.
  Instead of flying up to their perches, the baby Chukars were using their legs to run right up the side of a hay bale, flapping all the while.
  It means that birds use their wings and legs cooperatively.
  This single observation opened up a world of possibilities.
  Ken came up with a series of ingenious experiments, filming the birds as they raced up textured ramps tilted at increasing angles.
  Working together with Terry, Ken named the technique WAIR(Wing-Assisted Incline Running).
  The Dials came up with a viable origin for the flapping flight stroke of birds.

This approach creates a false dichotomy that lower standards of health, lack of access to housing, lower attainment in education, and higher unemployment are not human rights issues, and it makes it too easy to disguise any causal relationship between government actions and outcomes while limiting government accountability. On the other hand, using human rights as a framework gives indigenous peoples a means for expressing their legitimate claims to equal goods, services, and, most importantly, the protections of the law. It also provides a standard that the government is required to measure up to. There has been no simple way of deciding whether the progress made through record expenditure has been good enough. The practical approach to indigenous issues has lacked accountability. The passage suggests that the challenge now is to redefine and understand these issues as human rights issues.

  Passage 1 suggests that the number of tigers living in the wild may have been rising slowly over the last several years and that if continued surveys prove this to be true, this would mark the first time in more than a century that tiger populations have grown. However, while several countries have gone up in recent years, others have seen tigers disappear thanks to poaching and habitat loss. 
  Passage 2 criticizes the flawed methodologies that have been used to estimate global tiger populations. The authors argue that the overall number of wild tigers, if we could even get an accurate count, may not matter. The source populations are the ones we need to monitor vigilantly, using the best science available to track their numbers. 
  Therefore, it can reasonably be inferred that both passages suggest that wild tiger population sizes are recovering more fully in certain countries than in others.

  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers in order to close and capture its prey.
  The reason for this is that a single trigger does not release enough calcium ions to close the trap.
  Therefore, the requirement for multiple triggers ensures that the plant conserves its calcium reserves and its energy supply.
  Additionally, the passage mentions that if the trap closes too soon and does not capture its prey, the plant has wasted energy.

  Scientists proposed that the flytrap requires a relatively high concentration of calcium to close, and a single trigger does not reach this level.
  Therefore, the encoding of the information requires maintaining a high enough level of calcium so that a second increase pushes the total concentration of calcium over the threshold.
  If the second touch does not happen quickly, the final calcium concentration will not be high enough to close the trap and the memory is lost.

  The Venus flytrap requires two triggers before it springs shut to capture its prey.
  The plant's ability to close its trap is dependent on a high concentration of calcium ions.
  A single trigger hair is not enough to stimulate the trap to close because it does not reach the required threshold of calcium ions.
  A second trigger hair is required to push the concentration of calcium ions over the threshold and spring the trap.

  The trigger hairs allow the flytrap to literally feel their prey, and they act as triggers that spring the trap closed when the proper prey makes its way across the trap.
  A single action potential from just one trigger hair being touched does not reach the level of calcium concentration required for the trap to close.
  Therefore, a second hair needs to be stimulated to push the calcium concentration over this threshold and spring the trap.
  If the second touch does not happen quickly, the memory of the first touch is lost, and the trap remains open.

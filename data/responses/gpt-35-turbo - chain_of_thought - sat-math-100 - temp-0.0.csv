  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the formula for the equation of a line to find the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  We know that the initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$.
  We also know that the value of the equipment after 12 years is $\$ 0$.
  Therefore, we can find the slope of the line as follows:
  slope = (change in value) / (change in time) = ($0 - \$ 32,400$) / (12 years) = $-2700/year$
  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we can find the value of the equipment after 4 years as follows:
  value = slope * time + initial value = $-2700/year * 4 years + \$ 32,400 = \$ 20,400$
  Therefore, the camera equipment is worth $\$ 20,400$ 4 years after it is purchased.
  The answer is C: $\$ 21,600$.

  We can start by simplifying the expression inside the parentheses.
  $\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x+2+x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
  $= \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{x^2+5x+6}}$
  We can then simplify further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by the reciprocal of the fraction in the denominator.
  $= \frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$
  Therefore, the answer is B: $\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$.

  $$5ax^3 - abx^2 + 20x^2 + 12ax - 3bx - 12 = 20 x^{3}-9 x^{2}-2 x+12$$
  Simplifying the equation, we get:

  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is a linear function.
  The function can be represented in the form of $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept of the line.
  The slope of the line is the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight of the merchandise.
  We can find the slope by using any two points from the table.
  Let's use the points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(10, 21.89)$.
  The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$.
  Therefore, the slope of the line is $m=0.99$.
  The y-intercept of the line is the shipping charge when the weight of the merchandise is zero.
  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge is $\$16.94$ when the weight of the merchandise is $5$ pounds.
  Therefore, the y-intercept of the line is $b=16.94$.

  We can use the given table to find the slope of the line that relates $x$ and $y$.
  The slope of a line is given by the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}$.
  We can choose any two points from the table to calculate the slope.
  Let's choose the points $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$.
  The slope of the line that passes through these two points is $m=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$.
  The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  We can use the point $(a,0)$ to find the $y$-intercept.
  The equation of the line is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{a}{2}$.

  If the line passes through the origin, then the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line.
  The equation of the line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
  $y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$
  If the line passes through the origin, then $(0,0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
  Let's use the two given points to find the equation of the line and then substitute $(0,0)$ to solve for $k$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.
  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
  $y - k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(x - 2)$
  Substituting $(0,0)$, we get:
  $-k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$
  Solving for $k$, we get:
  $k = 0, 4, 8, 16$
  Therefore, any of the given values of $k$ could be the value of $k$.

  If the line passes through the origin, then the coordinates of both points must satisfy the equation of the line.
  The equation of the line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:
  $y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)$
  If the line passes through the origin, then $(0,0)$ must satisfy the equation of the line.
  Let's use the two given points to find the equation of the line and then substitute $(0,0)$ to solve for $k$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{32-k}{k-2}$.
  Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, we get:
  $y - k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(x - 2)$
  Substituting $(0,0)$, we get:
  $-k = \frac{32-k}{k-2}(-2)$
  Solving for $k$, we get:
  $k = 0, 4, 8, 16$
  Therefore, any of the given values of $k$ could be the value of $k$.

  To find the median of a set of numbers, we need to arrange the numbers in order from least to greatest and find the middle number.
  The given table is already arranged in order from least to greatest.
  The median of the 7 states is the middle number, which is State C with $25.9 \%$.
  The difference between the median of the 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95 \% - 25.9 \% = 1.05 \%$.
  The answer is not A because $0.05 \%$ is too small.
  The answer is not B because $0.95 \%$ is also too small.
  The answer is not D because $7.45 \%$ is too large.

  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We know that y = 2x.
  We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  To do that, we need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and add the expected increase in 2014.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula (5,880 + x*5,880) * (1 + y/100) = S, where S is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We can solve for y to get y = 0.1.

  After 10 years, the value of the machine will be $\$ 30,000$.
  The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$.
  The value of the machine decreases linearly over time.
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is a linear equation of the form $v = mt + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  We can use the two given points $(0, 120000)$ and $(10, 30000)$ to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the equation.

  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is a linear equation of the form $v = mt + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  We can use the two given points $(0, 120000)$ and $(10, 30000)$ to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the equation.
  The slope is $m = \frac{30000 - 120000}{10 - 0} = -9000$.
  The $y$-intercept is $b = 120000$.
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is $v = -9000t + 120000$.
  The answer is B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$.

  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 380 is 300, which means that x <= 3.
  If x = 3 and y = 6, then the total weight is 100(3) + 120(6) = 780, which is less than or equal to 1,100.

  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 380 is 300, which means that x <= 3.
  If x = 3 and y = 6, then the total weight is 100(3) + 120(6) = 780, which is less than or equal to 1,100.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 6.
  The answer is D: 6.

  We can use the Remainder Theorem to determine which of the given choices is a factor of $f(x)$.
  If $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.
  We can check each choice by plugging in the given value of $x$ and seeing if $f(x)$ equals zero.
  If $f(x)$ equals zero for a given choice, then that choice is a factor of $f(x)$.
  If $f(x)$ does not equal zero for a given choice, then that choice is not a factor of $f(x)$.
  We can check each choice as follows:
  $f(2)=1$, so $x-2$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
  $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if $x-3$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
  $f(4)=0$, so $x-4$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
  $f(5)=-2$, so $x-5$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.

  The oil and gas production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013.
  The difference in production is 4 - 1.9 = 2.1 million barrels.
  The production decreased over 13 years (2013 - 2000 = 13).
  Therefore, the production decreased at a constant rate of 2.1/13 million barrels per year.
  The function that models the production is of the form f(t) = mt + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the function is the rate of decrease, which is -2.1/13.

Let's assume the original price of the property is $x$ dollars.
Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, which means they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.
Therefore, the price after the first discount is $0.6x$ dollars.
They also received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8(0.6x) = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price, which is $x$ dollars.
We can set up an equation to solve for $x$:
$$0.48x = x - 0.4x$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$0.08x = x \cdot 0.4$$
$$0.08x = 0.4x$$

  The function $f$ is linear.
  We can find the slope of the line that passes through the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$.
  The slope of the line is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$.
  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y-5=4(x-1)$.
  Simplifying the equation, we get $y=4x+1$.
  Therefore, the answer is C: $f(x)=4 x+1$.

  $3x + 3 - 3 = 27 - 3$
  $3x = 24$
  Finally, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.
  $3x/3 = 24/3$
  $x = 8$
  Therefore, the value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is 8.

  The quantity of the product supplied to the market will equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market when $S(P)=D(P)$.
  We are given that $S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40$ and $D(P)=220-P$.
  Therefore, we need to solve the equation $\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P$ for $P$.
  Simplifying the equation, we get $\frac{3}{2} P=180$, which gives $P=120$.
  Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied to the market equals the quantity of the product demanded by the market is $\$ 120$.

  Combine like terms to get $\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)-4=6x-4$.
  Add 6 to both sides to get $\frac{2}{3}(9 x-6)=6x+2$.
  Distribute $\frac{2}{3}$ to $-6$ to get $\frac{18}{3}x-4=6x+2$.
  Simplify $\frac{18}{3}x$ to $6x$ to get $6x-4=6x+2$.
  Subtract $6x$ from both sides to get $-4=2$.
  This is a contradiction, so there is no solution for $x$.
  Therefore, there is no solution for $3x-2$.

  To determine which measure will change the most if the outlier is removed, we need to calculate the mean, median, and range of the data set with and without the outlier.
  The mean is the sum of all the values divided by the number of values.
  The median is the middle value when the data set is arranged in order.
  The range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in the data set.
  The outlier is 24, and there are 21 values in the data set.
  Without the outlier, there are 20 values in the data set.
  We can calculate the mean by summing all the values and dividing by the number of values.
  We can calculate the median by arranging the values in order and finding the middle value.
  We can calculate the range by subtracting the smallest value from the largest value.
  Let's calculate the mean, median, and range with and without the outlier:
  
  With outlier:
  Mean = (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16+24)/21 = 12
  Median = 12
  Range = 24 - 8 = 16
  
  Without outlier:
  Mean = (8+9+9+9+10+10+11+11+12+12+12+12+13+13+13+14+14+15+15+16)/20 = 11.5
  Median = (12+12)/2 = 12

  This means that the population will be multiplied by 0.9 every 20 years.
  The present population of the city is 50,000.

  If t is a multiple of 20, then the population will be multiplied by (0.9)^(t/20).
  If t is not a multiple of 20, then we need to find the number of 20-year periods that have passed and multiply the population by (0.9) raised to that power.

  We can expand the left side of the equation and compare the coefficients with the right side of the equation to find the values of $c$.
  The left side of the equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7)=a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$.
  We can compare the coefficients of the left and right sides of the equation to get the following system of equations:
  $a b=15$
  $7 a+2 b=c$
  $a+b=8$
  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of $a$, $b$, and $c$.
  We can use substitution to solve for $a$ and $b$.
  $a=8-b$
  $b=8-a$
  Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
  $(8-a)(a)=15$
  $8a-a^{2}=15$
  $a^{2}-8a+15=0$
  $(a-3)(a-5)=0$
  $a=3$ or $a=5$
  If $a=3$, then $b=5$.
  If $a=5$, then $b=3$.
  We can substitute these values of $a$ and $b$ into the second equation to find the values of $c$.
  If $a=3$ and $b=5$, then $c=7(3)+2(5)=21$.
  If $a=5$ and $b=3$, then $c=7(5)+2(3)=41$.

  We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We can use the formula for a linear function: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$.
  The slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$: $m=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}\approx7.5$.
  We can use the slope and one point to find the y-intercept: $(128, 950)$.

  Therefore, the equation of the line is $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.
  To check which point lies on the line, we can substitute the x and y coordinates of each point into the equation of the line and see if the equation is true.
  Only point A satisfies the equation of the line.
  Therefore, the answer is A: $(0,7)$.

  We can start by cross-multiplying the equation to get rid of the fractions.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except when the denominator $x-3$ is equal to zero.
  Therefore, $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
  We can simplify the equation to get:

  Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$.
  Then, subtract the second equation from the first equation.
  This will eliminate $x$ and we will get an equation in terms of $y$.
  If the coefficient of $y$ is the same in both equations, then the system will have no solution.
  Let's solve the system of equations for $y$.

  Let's solve the system of equations for $y$.
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & 4kx-12y=16 \\
  & 4x-5y=7 \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & k(4x-5y)=4x-5y-7 \\
  & 4kx-5ky=4x-5y-7 \\
  & 4kx-12y-5ky=16 \\
  & (4k-5k)x-12y=16 \\
  & (4k-5k)x=12y+16 \\
  & -x=\frac{12}{4k-5}y+\frac{16}{4k-5} \\
  \end{aligned}
  $$
  
  The coefficient of $y$ is $\frac{12}{4k-5}$.
  For the system to have no solution, the coefficient of $y$ must be the same in both equations.
  Therefore, we need to find the value of $k$ such that $\frac{12}{4k-5}=-\frac{3}{5}$.
  
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  & \frac{12}{4k-5}=-\frac{3}{5} \\
  & 12=-\frac{3}{5}(4k-5) \\
  & 12=-\frac{12}{5}k+\frac{15}{5} \\
  & -\frac{12}{5}k=-\frac{3}{5} \\
  & k=\frac{3}{12/5} \\
  & k=\frac{5}{4} \\

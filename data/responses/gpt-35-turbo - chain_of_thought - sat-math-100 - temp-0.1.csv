  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's call the initial value of the equipment V.
  After 12 years, the value of the equipment is 0.
  Therefore, the depreciation rate is V/12 per year.
  After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by 4V/12.
  Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years is V - 4V/12 = 2V/3.
  We know that V = $\$ 32,400$.
  Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years is 2V/3 = 2($\frac{1}{3}$)($\$$ 32,400) = $\$ 10,800$.
  The answer is A: $\$ 10,800$.

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the straight-line depreciation method to calculate the depreciation per year.
  The depreciation per year is the difference between the initial value and the salvage value divided by the useful life.
  The initial value is $\$ 32,400$ and the salvage value is $\$ 0$.
  The useful life is 12 years.
  The depreciation per year is $(32,400 - 0) / 12 = 2,700$.
  After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $2,700 \times 4 = 10,800$.
  Therefore, the equipment is worth $32,400 - 10,800 = 21,600$ after 4 years.

  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's call the initial value of the equipment V and the rate of depreciation R.
  Then, the value of the equipment after t years is given by V - R*t.
  We know that V = $\$ 32,400$ and t = 4.
  We need to find R to calculate the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  The rate of depreciation R is given by (V - 0)/(12 - 0) = V/12.
  Therefore, R = $\$ 32,400$/12 = $\$ 2,700$.
  The value of the equipment after 4 years is V - R*t = $\$ 32,400$ - $\$ 2,700$*4 = $\$ 21,600$.

  Let's use the formula for the equation of a line to find the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  We know that the initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$.
  We also know that the final value of the equipment is $\$ 0$.
  Therefore, the slope of the line is $m = \frac{0 - 32400}{12 - 0} = -2700$.
  The equation of the line is $y = mx + b$, where $y$ is the value of the equipment after $x$ years, $m$ is the slope, and $b$ is the initial value.
  Plugging in the values we know, we get $y = -2700x + 32400$.
  To find the value of the equipment after 4 years, we plug in $x = 4$ and get $y = -2700(4) + 32400 = 21600$.

  The function should have a slope that represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight.
  The function should have a y-intercept that represents the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0.
  The slope of the function can be calculated as the change in shipping charge divided by the change in merchandise weight between any two points on the line.

  The function can be written in slope-intercept form as $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  To find the slope, we can use the formula $m=\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}$.

  The slope of the line can be calculated as the change in the y-value divided by the change in the x-value between any two points on the line.
  Using the points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$, we can calculate the slope as $m=\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$.
  The y-intercept is the value of $f(x)$ when $x=0$, which is not given in the table.
  However, we can use the slope and any point on the line to find the y-intercept using the equation $b=y-mx$.
  Using the point $(5,16.94)$, we can calculate the y-intercept as $b=16.94-0.99(5)=11.99$.
  Therefore, the function that represents the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge should be a linear function.
  The function should have a slope that represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight.
  The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in shipping charges between two weights and dividing by the difference in weights.
  Using the data from the table, the slope is calculated as follows:
  slope = (shipping charge for 10 pounds - shipping charge for 5 pounds) / (10 pounds - 5 pounds)
        = ($21.89 - $16.94) / (10 pounds - 5 pounds)
        = $4.95 / 5 pounds
        = $0.99 per pound
  The y-intercept of the function represents the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0 pounds.
  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge is $16.94 when the merchandise weight is 5 pounds.
  Therefore, the y-intercept is $16.94.
  The function that represents the total shipping charge is:
  f(x) = slope * x + y-intercept

  The total number of participants is 300.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants is 36.
  The number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants is $p$.
  We want to find the possible values of $p$ if more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture.
  We can start by finding the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture.
  If $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, then the minimum number of participants who chose the first picture is $0.20(300)=60$.
  Since more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture is greater than 60.
  We know that 36 participants chose the first picture among the first 150 participants.
  Therefore, the actual number of participants who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants must be greater than $60-36=24$.

  20% of all participants is 0.20 x 300 = 60.
  If more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture, then 36 + p > 60.
  Therefore, p > 24.
  The value of p must be less than or equal to 150.

Let's start by finding the number of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants. We know that 36 people chose the first picture in the set. Therefore, the percentage of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants is $\frac{36}{150} = 0.24$. 

We also know that more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture in the set. Since there were 300 participants in total, more than $0.20(300) = 60$ people chose the first picture. 

Let's now consider the remaining 150 participants. We don't know how many of them chose the first picture, but we do know that the total number of people who chose the first picture is greater than 60. Therefore, $p+36>60$, which simplifies to $p>24$. 

We also know that $p$ is less than or equal to 150, since there were only 150 participants left to choose the picture. 

Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of $p$ is $p>24$, where $p \leq 150$.

  The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.

  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100 \% \approx 5 \%$.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{y}{100} \times 5,880$.

  We want to find the value of $(1+\frac{2x}{100}) \times (1+\frac{y}{100})$.
  Since the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is approximately 5%, we can assume that $x=5$.
  We know that $(1+\frac{2x}{100}) \times (1+\frac{y}{100}) = 1+\frac{2x+y+2xy}{100}$.
  We want to find the value of $2x+y+2xy$.

  We can solve for $y$ using the fact that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.

  We know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 
  $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
  Let's assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $x\%$.
  Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 would be $2x\%$.
  We can write the following equation:
  $\frac{5,880-x\%\times 5,880}{5,600} = 1 + 2\left(\frac{5,880-5,880\times 1.05}{5,880\times 1.05}\right)$
  Solving for $x$, we get $x\% \approx 8.1\%$
  Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be:
  $5,880\times 1.081 \approx 6,368$

  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2x.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2012 is 5,600.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1+y/100)(1+2x/100)(5,880).
  We need to find (1+y/100)(1+2x/100)(5,880).
  We know that (1+x/100)(1+y/100) = 1+2x/100.
  Therefore, (1+y/100)(1+2x/100)(5,880) = (1+x/100)(1+y/100)(1+2x/100)(5,600).
  We can solve for y using the equation above.
  After solving, we get y = 8.
  Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1+8/100)(1+2x/100)(5,880).
  We need to solve for x.
  We know that (1+x/100)(1+8/100) = 1+16/100.
  After solving, we get x = 7.
  Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1+8/100)(1+2*7/100)(5,880) = 6,027.

- We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
- We don't know the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, but we can estimate it based on the information given.
- Let's first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
  - Percent increase = ((new value - old value) / old value) x 100%
  - Percent increase from 2012 to 2013 = ((5,880 - 5,600) / 5,600) x 100% = 5%
- Let's now find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014:
  - We don't know the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, but we can estimate it based on the information given.
  - Let's assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is x%.
  - Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 would be 2x%.
  - Using this assumption, we can estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 as follows:
    - Percent increase from 2012 to 2014 = ((new value - old value) / old value) x 100%
    - 2x% = ((new value - 5,600) / 5,600) x 100%
    - new value = 5,600 x (1 + 2x%/100%)
- We need to solve for x to find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 that satisfies the given condition.
- According to the problem, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 5%, and the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
- Let's use this information to set up an equation:
  - 2x% = 2 x (percent increase from 2013 to 2014)
  - 5% = percent increase from 2012 to 2013
  - (new value) = 5,880 x (1 + percent increase from 2013 to 2014)
  - We can rewrite the equation for the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 as follows:
    - (new value) = 5,600 x (1 + 2 x (percent increase from 2013 to 2014))
    - 5,880 x (1 + percent increase from 2013 to 2014) = 5,600 x (1 + 2 x (percent increase from 2013 to 2014))
    - 5,880 + 58.8 x percent increase from 2013 to 2014 = 5,600 + 11200 x percent increase from 2013 to 2014
    - 11141.2 x percent increase from 2013 to 2014 = 280
    - percent increase from 2013 to 2014 = 0.025
- Now that we know the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we can estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014:
  - new value = 5,880 x (1 + 0.025) = 6,027
- Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We know that y = 2x.
  We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  To do that, we need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and add the expected increase in 2014.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula (5,880 + x*5,880) * (1 + y/100) = S, where S is the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We can solve for y to get y = 0.1.

  We can solve for y using the given information and then find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  
Calculation:
  Let's first find x.
  x = (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 * 100 = 5%
  We know that 2x = 10% is the percent increase from 2012 to 2014.
  Let's now solve for y.
  10% = (1+y/100)(1+2x/100) - 1
  0.1 = (1+y/100)(1.1)
  0.1/1.1 = y/100
  y = 9.09%
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1+9.09/100)(1+2*5/100)(5,880) = 6,027.

  The population has grown at an average rate of 1.9% per year since 1945.
  The population in 1975 was approximately 4 billion people.
  We can use the formula for exponential growth to find the function that represents the world's population.
  The formula for exponential growth is $P(t)=P_{0}(1+r)^{t}$, where $P_{0}$ is the initial population, $r$ is the annual growth rate, and $t$ is the time in years.
  We can use the given information to find $P_{0}$ and $r$.
  $P_{0}=4$ billion people.
  The annual growth rate is 1.9%, which is equivalent to 0.019 in decimal form.
  Therefore, the function that represents the world's population is $P(t)=4(1.019)^{t}$.
  The answer is A: $P(t)=4(1.019)^{t}$.

  We can use the formula $d = rt$ where $d$ is the diameter, $r$ is the rate of growth, and $t$ is the time.
  We can assume that the rate of growth is constant for both trees.

  We can convert the answer to inches.
  Let's solve the problem to find the answer.
  
Action: 
  Let $r$ be the rate of growth of each tree in feet per year.
  The diameter of the white birch tree 10 years from now is $d_{w} = r \cdot 10 + 1$.
  The diameter of the pin oak tree 10 years from now is $d_{p} = r \cdot 10 + 1$.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now is $d_{p} - d_{w} = r \cdot 10$.
  We know that $1$ foot $= 12$ inches, so $r$ is in inches per year.
  We can estimate $r$ by assuming that the diameter of a tree increases by $1/10$ of an inch per year per inch of diameter.

  $30,000=120,000-10d$
  $10d=90,000$
  $d=9,000$

  The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year.
  After 10 years, the value of the machine will be $\$ 30,000$.
  Let $d$ be the amount of depreciation per year.
  Then, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is $v=120,000-dt$.
  We need to find the equation that satisfies the given conditions.

  If we try y = 5, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 600 <= 1,100, which means that x <= 5.
  Since x and y must be integers, the largest possible value of x is 5, which means that the largest possible value of y is 5.

  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can simplify the second inequality by dividing both sides by 20: 5x + 6y <= 55.
  We can rewrite the first inequality as x >= 10 - y.
  We can substitute x in the second inequality: 5(10 - y) + 6y <= 55.
  We can simplify and solve for y: y <= 4.166.
  Since y must be a whole number, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 4.

  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum value of y.
  We can use trial and error to find the maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities.
  If we start with y = 6, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 720, which means that 100x <= 380.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 3.
  Therefore, y = 6 is not a valid solution.
  If we try y = 5, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 600, which means that 100x <= 500.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 5.
  Therefore, y = 5 is a valid solution.
  If we try y = 4, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 480, which means that 100x <= 620.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 6.
  Therefore, y = 4 is a valid solution.
  If we try y = 3, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 360, which means that 100x <= 740.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 7.
  Therefore, y = 3 is a valid solution.
  If we try y = 2, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 240, which means that 100x <= 860.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 8.
  Therefore, y = 2 is a valid solution.
  If we try y = 1, then 100x + 120y = 100x + 120, which means that 100x <= 980.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 9.
  Therefore, y = 1 is a valid solution.
  If we try y = 0, then 100x + 120y = 100x, which means that 100x <= 1,100.
  The largest integer value of x that satisfies this inequality is x = 11.
  Therefore, y = 0 is a valid solution.
  The maximum value of y that satisfies both inequalities is 5.

To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, we need to minimize the number of 100-pound packages.
Let's assume the helicopter carries x 120-pound packages and (10 - x) 100-pound packages.
The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so we can write the equation:
120x + 100(10 - x) ≤ 1100
Simplifying the equation, we get:
20x ≤ 100

  If $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$, then $f(a)=0$.
  We can test each choice by plugging in the given values of $x$ and checking if $f(x)$ equals to zero.
  If $f(x)$ equals to zero for a given choice, then that choice is a factor of $f(x)$.
  If $f(x)$ does not equal to zero for all given choices, then none of the choices is a factor of $f(x)$.
  We can test the choices as follows:
  - For choice A: $f(2)=1\neq 0$, so $x-2$ is not a factor of $f(x)$.
  - For choice B: $f(3)$ is not given, so we cannot determine if $x-3$ is a factor of $f(x)$.

Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, which means they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.
Then, they received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price, which means they paid $80 \%$ of the discounted price.
So, the price they paid is $80 \%$ of $60 \%$ of the original price, which is $0.8 \times 0.6 \times x = 0.48x$ dollars.
We are asked to find the original price, which is $x$ dollars.
We know that $0.48x$ dollars is the price they paid.
Therefore, $x = \frac{0.48x}{0.6} = 0.8x$, which means $0.2x = \frac{2}{10}x$ dollars is the discount they received.
So, the price they paid is $0.8x = x - 0.2x = 0.8 \times$ the original price.
Therefore, the original price is $\frac{0.8x}{0.8} = x$ dollars.

Choice A: If the original price was $\$ 350,000$, then the final price would be $0.48 \times \$ 350,000 = \$ 168,000$. This is not close to any of the answer choices, so we can eliminate it.

Choice C: If the original price was $\$ 233,300$, then the final price would be $0.48 \times \$ 233,300 \approx \$ 111,984$. This is not close to choice B, so we can eliminate it.

- We are interested in the probability of choosing a person from Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream.
- We can use the formula for conditional probability: P(Y | at least 1 dream) = P(Y and at least 1 dream) / P(at least 1 dream)
- We can find P(Y and at least 1 dream) by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams: 11 + 68 = 79.
- We can find P(at least 1 dream) by adding the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams: 28 + 57 + 11 + 68 = 164.

  We need to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $9f=180-4p-4c$.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

  The initial population is 50,000.
  We need to find an expression that represents the population of the city t years from now.
  If t is a multiple of 20, then we can use the formula P = 50,000(0.9)^(t/20).
  If t is not a multiple of 20, then we can use the formula P = 50,000(0.9)^(20*floor(t/20)).
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
  If we substitute t = 20 into both expressions, we get:
  B: $50,000(0.1)^{\frac{20}{20}}$ = $50,000(0.1)^1$ = 5,000
  D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{20}{20}}$ = $50,000(0.9)^1$ = 45,000

  We can expand the left side of the equation and compare the coefficients of the resulting quadratic equation with the given quadratic equation to find the value of $c$.
  The quadratic equation on the left side of the equation is $(a b) x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$.
  We can compare the coefficients of the quadratic terms to get $a b=15$.
  We can compare the coefficients of the constant terms to get $14=2 \cdot 7$.
  We can compare the coefficients of the linear terms to get $7 a+2 b=c$.
  We know that $a+b=8$, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$ to get $a=8-b$.
  Substituting this into the equation $a b=15$, we get $(8-b) b=15$, which simplifies to $b^{2}-8 b+15=0$.
  Factoring this quadratic equation, we get $(b-3)(b-5)=0$, so $b=3$ or $b=5$.
  Substituting these values of $b$ into the equation $7 a+2 b=c$, we get $c=21$ when $b=3$ and $c=10$ when $b=5$.

  We can set up a system of equations to solve for $a$ and $b$:
  $ab=15$
  $7 a+2 b= c$
  We can solve for $a$ and $b$ by factoring 15 into two factors whose sum is 8.

  Substituting these values into the second equation, we get $7(3)+2(5)=c$, which simplifies to $c=21$.
  Alternatively, we can factor 15 into 1 and 15, which gives us $a=15$ and $b=1$.

  We also know that $a+b=8$.
  We can substitute $b=8-a$ into the equation for $c$ to get $c=7 a+2(8-a)=6 a+16$.

  We can use the formula for the equation of a line, y = mx + b, where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
  In this case, the dependent variable is the monthly rental price, r, and the independent variable is the purchase price, p.
  We can use two points from the table to find the slope, m, of the line.
  For example, we can use the points (128, 950) and (176, 1310).
  The slope, m, is equal to the change in y over the change in x, or (1310 - 950)/(176 - 128) = 360/48 = 7.5.
  We can then use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, y - y1 = m(x - x1), where (x1, y1) is one of the points we used to find the slope.
  Let's use the point (128, 950).

  Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds.
  We can use unit conversion to find out how many meters he walks in 1 second.
  25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.82 meters per second (approximately).
  We can use this rate to find out how many meters he will walk in 4 minutes.
  1 minute = 60 seconds, so 4 minutes = 240 seconds.

  Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds.
  To find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes, we need to convert 4 minutes to seconds.
  4 minutes = 4 x 60 = 240 seconds.
  We can use a proportion to find the distance he will walk in 240 seconds.
  If Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds, then he walks x meters in 240 seconds.
  25/13.7 = x/240
  Solving for x, we get x = 438.96 meters.
  The closest answer choice to 438.96 meters is 450 meters.

  Therefore, the number of people invited to the fund-raiser $n$ years after Eleanor began organizing the event is $f(n) = 30 \times 2^{n-1}$.
  This is an increasing exponential function because the base of the exponent is greater than 1, and the function increases as $n$ increases.

  In the first year, Eleanor invited 30 people.
  For the second year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2*30 = 60 people.
  For the third year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2*60 = 120 people.
  For the fourth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2*120 = 240 people.
  For the fifth year, she invited double the number of people she had invited the previous year, which is 2*240 = 480 people.
  Therefore, the function $f$ is not linear because the rate of increase is not constant.
  The function $f$ is increasing because the number of people invited each year is increasing.
  The function $f$ is exponential because the rate of increase is proportional to the number of people invited in the previous year.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The function $f$ is an increasing exponential function.

  The equation gives the height of a ball at any time $t$.
  We need to find the initial velocity $v$ of the ball.
  The initial velocity is the velocity at $t=0$.
  At $t=0$, the height of the ball is $k$.
  Therefore, $h=k$ when $t=0$.
  We can differentiate the equation to find the velocity function.
  $v=\frac{dh}{dt}=-32t+v$
  $v$ cancels out, and we get $v=-32t$.
  We can substitute this value of $v$ in the equation $h=-16 t^{2}+v t+k$ to get $h=-16 t^{2}-32t+k$.
  We can rearrange this equation to get $-16t^2-32t+h-k=0$.
  We can use the quadratic formula to solve for $t$.
  $t=\frac{-(-32)\pm\sqrt{(-32)^2-4(-16)(h-k)}}{2(-16)}=\frac{1}{32}(8\pm\sqrt{64-4(16)(k-h)})$
  We can simplify this to $t=\frac{1}{16}(4\pm\sqrt{16-(k-h)})$.
  Since the ball is thrown upwards, we take the positive root.
  Therefore, $t=\frac{1}{16}(4+\sqrt{16-(k-h)})$.
  We can substitute this value of $t$ in the equation $v=-32t$ to get $v=-\frac{1}{2}(4+\sqrt{16-(k-h)})$.

  We can start by cross-multiplying to get rid of the denominators.
  $$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$2x^2-6x=2x^2-6x$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except when the denominator $x-3$ is equal to zero.
  Therefore, $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
  We can simplify the equation by canceling out the common factor of $2x$ on both sides.
  $$2x(x-3)=2(x)(x-3)$$
  $$x(x-3)=x(x-3)$$
  $$x^2-3x=x^2-3x$$
  The equation is true for all values of $x$ except when the denominator $x-3$ is equal to zero.
  Therefore, $x$ cannot be equal to 3.
  The equation is true for all other values of $x$.
  We can check the answer choices to see which values satisfy the equation.
  A: 0 and 2 do not satisfy the equation because they make the denominator zero.
  B: 0 and 4 satisfy the equation.
  C: -4 and 4 satisfy the equation.
  D: 4 satisfies the equation.
  Therefore, the answer is either B, C, or D.
  However, we need to eliminate C because -4 does not satisfy the equation since it makes the denominator zero.

  We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
  Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $k$.
  Then, subtract the second equation from the first equation.
  We get $(4-5k)x-(3k)y=4-7k$.

  $$(4k-k) x - (-12+5k) y = 16-7k$$
  $$3k x + (5k-12) y = 16-7k$$
  Solve for $y$:
  $$y = \frac{16-7k}{5k-12}$$

  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

  Factoring out $y$, we get:
  $$y(7k-12)=16-7k$$
  If $7k-12=0$, then we have $0=16-7k$, which is impossible.
  Therefore, we need $7k-12\neq 0$.
  Dividing both sides by $7k-12$, we get:
  $$y=\frac{16-7k}{7k-12}$$
  Substituting $y$ into the first equation, we get:
  $$kx-3\left(\frac{16-7k}{7k-12}\right)=4$$
  Multiplying both sides by $7k-12$, we get:
  $$k(7k-12)x-3(16-7k)=4(7k-12)$$
  Simplifying, we get:
  $$7k^2x-12kx-48=28k-48$$
  Collecting like terms, we get:

  If $k=-\frac{16}{7}$, then $y=-\frac{192}{119}x-\frac{16}{17}-\frac{112}{119}=-\frac{192}{119}x-\frac{233}{119}$.
  If $k=-\frac{12}{5}$, then $y=-\frac{144}{85}x-\frac{16}{17}-\frac{84}{85}=-\frac{144}{85}x-\frac{149}{85}$.

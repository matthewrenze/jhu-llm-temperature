  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's call the initial value of the equipment V and the depreciation rate r.
  Then, we have V - 12rV = 0, which gives r = 1/12.
  After t years, the value of the equipment is V - rtV = V(1 - rt).
  After 4 years, the value of the equipment is V(1 - (1/12) * 4) = V(2/3).

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, it is considered to have no monetary value.
  This means that the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  The depreciation per year is the same.
  Let's call the depreciation per year ""d"".
  The initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$.
  After 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by 4d.
  The value of the equipment after 4 years is $32,400 - 4d$.
  We need to find the value of d to solve the problem.
  Since the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years, we know that:
  $32,400 - 12d = 0$
  Solving for d, we get:
  $d = 2,700$
  Therefore, the value of the equipment after 4 years is:
  $32,400 - 4d = 32,400 - 4(2,700) = 21,600$

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the formula for the equation of a line to find the value of the equipment after 4 years.
  The initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$ and the final value is $\$ 0$.
  The time it takes to depreciate from $\$ 32,400$ to $\$ 0$ is 12 years.
  Therefore, the rate of depreciation is $\frac{\$ 32,400 - \$ 0}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700$ per year.
  After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $\$ 2,700 \times 4 = \$ 10,800$.

  The volume of the syrup needed to fill the can is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
  The volume of the cylinder is $V_{cylinder} = \pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
  We can find the radius of the base by using the formula for the area of a circle: $A_{circle} = \pi r^{2}$.

  We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, y = mx + b, where y is the total shipping charge, x is the merchandise weight, m is the slope, and b is the y-intercept.
  We can find the slope by using two points from the table: (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89).
  The slope is (21.89 - 16.94) / (10 - 5) = 0.99.
  The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0, which is not given in the table.
  However, we can use the point (5, 16.94) to find the y-intercept.
  16.94 = 0.99(5) + b
  b = 11.99

  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge should be a linear function.
  The function should have a slope that represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight.
  The function should have a y-intercept that represents the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is zero.
  Using the given data, we can find the slope and y-intercept of the function.
  The slope of the function is the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight, which is equal to the difference in the shipping charge divided by the difference in the merchandise weight between any two points on the line.
  We can use the points (5, 16.94) and (10, 21.89) to find the slope of the function.
  The difference in the shipping charge is $21.89 - 16.94 = 4.95$.
  The difference in the merchandise weight is $10 - 5 = 5$.
  Therefore, the slope of the function is $4.95/5 = 0.99$.
  The y-intercept of the function is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is zero.
  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0 is $0$.
  Therefore, the y-intercept of the function is $0$.
  The function that satisfies these conditions is $f(x) = 0.99x + 0$.

  The function is linear, so it has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope is the rate of change of the function, which is the shipping charge per pound of merchandise weight.
  We can find the slope by calculating the difference in shipping charges for two different weights and dividing by the difference in weights.
  For example, the difference in shipping charges between 5 and 10 pounds is $21.89 - 16.94 = 4.95$ dollars, and the difference in weights is 10 - 5 = 5 pounds, so the slope is $4.95/5 = 0.99$ dollars per pound.
  The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the weight is 0 pounds, which is not given in the table, but we can find it by plugging in one of the weights and charges into the equation and solving for $b$.
  For example, if we use the weight of 5 pounds and the shipping charge of $16.94, we get $16.94 = 0.99(5) + b$, which gives $b = 11.99$.

  The function is linear, which means it has the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the function is the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight of the merchandise.
  The slope can be calculated by finding the change in the shipping charge over the change in the weight of the merchandise.
  Using the data from the table, we can calculate the slope as follows:
  slope $= \dfrac{\text{change in shipping charge}}{\text{change in weight}} = \dfrac{\$ (21.89-16.94)}{10-5} = \$ 0.99$

  To find the y-intercept, we can use any point on the line. Let's use the point $(5,16.94)$.

  The slope of the line is equal to the change in y over the change in x, which is equal to the difference in shipping charges over the difference in merchandise weight.
  Using the data from the table, we can calculate the slope of the line as follows:
  slope $= \frac{\text{change in shipping charge}}{\text{change in merchandise weight}} = \frac{\$21.89-\$16.94}{10-5} = \frac{\$4.95}{5} = \$0.99$
  Therefore, the slope of the line is $m=0.99$.
  The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is zero. From the table, we see that the shipping charge is $\$16.94$ when the merchandise weight is $5$ pounds. Therefore, the y-intercept is $b=\$16.94$.

The number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants is 36.
Therefore, the number of people who did not choose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants is 150 - 36 = 114.
We are told that more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture in the set. 
Since there are 300 participants in total, more than 20% of 300 is 60.

$p \geq 24$
We also know that $p$ is less than or equal to 150 (since there are only 150 remaining participants). Therefore, the best inequality that describes the possible values of $p$ is:

Let's first find the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants. 
We know that 36 people chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants. 
Since more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture in the set, we know that at least 60 people chose the first picture in the set (20% of 300). 
Therefore, among the remaining 150 participants, at least $60-36=24$ people must have chosen the first picture in the set. 
So, $p$ must be greater than or equal to 24. 
The possible values of $p$ must satisfy this inequality and the condition that $p \leq 150$.

  We can use the formula (1+y/100) = (1+x/100)*(1+2x/100) to solve for y.
  Simplifying the equation, we get y = (3x^2 + 5x)/2.
  Substituting 0.05 for x, we get y = 0.0975.
  The expected increase in 2014 is 2*0.0975 = 0.195.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is 5,880*(1+0.195) = 6,968.4.
  The answer is closest to 6,968, which is D: 6,468.

  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
  We know that y = 2x.
  We need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  To do that, we need to find the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and add the expected increase.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 - 5,600) / 5,600 = 0.05 = 5%.
  The percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is y.
  We can find y by using the formula y = (new value - old value) / old value.
  Let z be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We can find z by using the formula z = 5,880 + 5,880 * y.
  We know that y = 2x, so we can substitute to get z = 5,880 + 5,880 * 2x.
  We can solve for x by using the formula x = (new value - old value) / old value.
  We know that x = 5%, so we can substitute to get z = 5,880 + 5,880 * 2 * 0.05 = 6,156.
  Therefore, the manager expected 6,156 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

  Let x be the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
  Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 0.5x.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1 + 0.5x) * 5,880.
  We need to find the value of (1 + 0.5x) * 5,880.
  We can solve for x using the given information.
  0.5x = 2(x - 0.02)
  0.5x = 2x - 0.04
  1.5x = 0.04
  x = 0.0267 (rounded to four decimal places)
  Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is (1 + 0.5x) * 5,880 = 6,027.6 (rounded to one decimal place)

  The growth rate of a white birch tree and a pin oak tree is not given.
  We can use the formula for the circumference of a circle to find the difference in their diameters.
  The formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\pi r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circle.
  The diameter of a circle is twice the radius, so $d = 2r$.
  Therefore, $r = \frac{d}{2}$.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}}$.
  The circumference of a circle with radius $r$ is $C = 2\pi r$.
  The difference in circumference 10 years from now will be $C_{\text{pin oak}} - C_{\text{white birch}}$.
  The difference in circumference is $2\pi r_{\text{pin oak}} - 2\pi r_{\text{white birch}} = 2\pi (r_{\text{pin oak}} - r_{\text{white birch}})$.
  The difference in diameter is $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}} = 2(r_{\text{pin oak}} - r_{\text{white birch}})$.
  We need to find the difference in diameter 10 years from now.
  We can assume that the growth rate of the trees is proportional to their current diameters.
  Let $k$ be the proportionality constant.
  Then, the growth rate of the white birch tree is $k(12)$ inches per year, and the growth rate of the pin oak tree is $k(12 + 0.2k)$ inches per year.
  The diameter of the white birch tree 10 years from now will be $d_{\text{white birch}} + 10k(12)$ inches.
  The diameter of the pin oak tree 10 years from now will be $d_{\text{pin oak}} + 10k(12 + 0.2k)$ inches.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $(d_{\text{pin oak}} + 10k(12 + 0.2k)) - (d_{\text{white birch}} + 10k(12)) = d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}} + 10k(0.2k)$ inches.
  We need to find the value of $k$ that will make $10k(0.2k)$ as small as possible.
  The value of $k$ that minimizes $10k(0.2k)$ is $k = 0$, which means that the growth rate of the trees is 0.

  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be the difference between their current diameters plus the growth of each tree over 10 years.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be closest to the difference between their current diameters plus the growth of each tree over 10 years.
  Therefore, we can calculate the difference in their diameters 10 years from now by using the formula: $12(1.06^{10}-1)-12(1.04^{10}-1)$.
  We can then round the result to the nearest tenth and compare it to the answer choices.

  Let's assume that the diameter of the white birch tree and the pin oak tree will increase by the same percentage each year.
  We can use the formula $d=rt$ where $d$ is the diameter, $r$ is the rate of increase, and $t$ is the time in years.
  We can solve for $r$ by using the formula $r=\frac{d}{t}$.
  The difference in their diameters after 10 years will be $d_{\text{pin oak}}-d_{\text{white birch}}$.
  We can calculate the rate of increase for each tree and then use it to calculate their diameters after 10 years.
  Then, we can find the difference between their diameters.
  
Calculation:
  The rate of increase for the white birch tree is $\frac{1\text{ ft}}{10\text{ years}}=\frac{12\text{ in}}{10\text{ years}}=1.2\text{ in/year}$.
  The rate of increase for the pin oak tree is $\frac{1\text{ ft}}{10\text{ years}}=\frac{12\text{ in}}{10\text{ years}}=1.2\text{ in/year}$.
  The diameter of the white birch tree after 10 years will be $d_{\text{white birch}}=1\text{ ft}+1.2\text{ in/year}\times 10\text{ years}=13\text{ ft}$.
  The diameter of the pin oak tree after 10 years will be $d_{\text{pin oak}}=1\text{ ft}+1.2\text{ in/year}\times 10\text{ years}=13\text{ ft}$.

  Simplifying this, we get: 1,000 - 20y + 120y <= 1,100, which gives us 100y <= 100, or y <= 1.
  However, we know that y must be at least 1 (since the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages and there are no fractional packages), so the maximum value of y is 1.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 1.
  The answer is A: 2.

Therefore, the price they paid is $0.8 \times 0.6 x = 0.48 x$.
We need to find the original price $x$.
We know that $0.48 x$ is the price they paid, which is $0.52$ times the original price.
Therefore, $x = \frac{0.48 x}{0.52} = 0.923 x$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{0.48 x}{0.52} \approx 0.923 x \approx 0.92 x$.

Townsend Realty received a $40 \%$ discount off the original price, so they paid $60 \%$ of the original price.

So, the final price they paid is $80 \%$ of $60 \%$ of the original price.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8 \times 0.6 \times x = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price $x$.
We know that $0.48x = 145,800$ dollars (approximate value of $145,800$ is obtained by multiplying $0.48$ with $305,000$ which is the approximate value of the answer choices).

We can set up an equation: $0.48x = \text{final price they paid}$.

Therefore, the price after the first discount is $0.6x$ dollars.
They also received an additional $20 \%$ off the discounted price for purchasing the property in cash.
Therefore, the final price they paid is $0.8(0.6x) = 0.48x$ dollars.
We need to find the original price $x$.
We know that $0.48x$ is the price they paid.
Therefore, $0.48x = x - 0.4x = 0.6x$ dollars is the original price.
Solving for $x$, we get $x = \frac{0.48x}{0.6} = 0.8x$.

  The energy from 1 gram of protein is 4.0 food calories.
  The energy from 1 gram of fat is 9.0 food calories.
  The energy from 1 gram of carbohydrate is 4.0 food calories.
  Let $p$ be the grams of protein, $f$ be the grams of fat, and $c$ be the grams of carbohydrate.
  The total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories.
  Therefore, $4p+9f+4c=180$.
  We need to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $9f=180-4p-4c$.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
  Therefore, the answer is B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

  The formula for the speed of sound wave is given by $a=1,052+1.08 t$.
  We need to find the temperature at which the speed of sound wave is closest to 1000 feet per second.
  We can solve this problem by substituting the given values in the formula and calculating the speed of sound wave at each temperature.
  Then, we can compare the calculated values with 1000 and find the temperature that gives the closest value to 1000.
  We can use estimation to find the closest value.
  Let's substitute each temperature value in the formula and calculate the speed of sound wave.
  $a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,000.32$
  $a=1,052+1.08(-48)=998.56$
  $a=1,052+1.08(-49)=997.68$
  $a=1,052+1.08(-50)=996.8$
  The closest value to 1000 is 998.56.
  Therefore, the temperature at which the speed of sound wave is closest to 1000 feet per second is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

  The vertex of a parabola is located at the point $(h,k)$ where $h$ is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex and $k$ is the $y$-coordinate of the vertex.

  Simplifying the expression, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{96}}{6}$.
  Further simplifying, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm 4 \sqrt{6}}{6}$.
  Factoring out $-2$ from the numerator and denominator, we get $x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{6}}{3}$.
  Therefore, the solutions to the equation $3 x^{2}+12 x+6=0$ are $x=\frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{6}}{3}$.

  We can solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: $x=\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^{2}-4 a c}}{2 a}$.
  Comparing the given equation with the standard quadratic equation $a x^{2}+b x+c=0$, we have $a=3, b=12,$ and $c=6$.
  Substituting the values of $a, b,$ and $c$ in the quadratic formula, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{12^{2}-4 \cdot 3 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 3}$.
  Simplifying the expression, we get $x=\frac{-12 \pm \sqrt{96}}{6}$.
  Further simplifying, we get $x=-2 \pm \frac{\sqrt{24}}{3}$.
  We can simplify the square root of 24 as $\sqrt{24}=\sqrt{4 \cdot 6}=2 \sqrt{6}$.
  Therefore, the solutions are $x=-2 \pm \frac{2 \sqrt{6}}{3}$.

After decreasing the width by $p$%, the new width becomes $(1-\frac{p}{100})w$. 
The new area of the rectangle is $(1.1l)(1-\frac{p}{100})w$. 
According to the problem, the new area is 12% less than the original area. 
So, we can write the equation:

  We need to find a linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We can use the formula for the equation of a line: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can use the given data to find the slope and y-intercept.
  The slope is the change in $r$ divided by the change in $p$.
  We can choose two points from the table and use them to find the slope.
  For example, we can use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$.
  The change in $r$ is $1310-950=360$, and the change in $p$ is $176-128=48$.
  Therefore, the slope is $m=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$.
  To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the points and the slope.
  For example, we can use the point $(128, 950)$ and the slope $m=7.5$.
  We can substitute these values into the formula $y=mx+b$ and solve for $b$.
  $950=7.5(128)+b$
  $b=950-7.5(128)$

  We can use the formula for the equation of a line: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can find the slope by using two points from the table: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$.
  The slope is equal to the change in y divided by the change in x: $m=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}=7.5$.
  The y-intercept is the value of $r(p)$ when $p=0$, which is not given in the table.

  Let's use the point $(70, 515)$.

We can check that these values satisfy the original equation:
$$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2(0)}{2} \Rightarrow 0=0$$
$$\frac{4}{4-3}=\frac{2(4)}{2} \Rightarrow 8=8$$
Thus, the answer is B: 0 and 4.

  Multiply both sides of the equation by $2(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominators.
  Simplify the equation and solve for $x$.
  Check if the solution satisfies the original equation.
  
Action: Answer(""B"") 

To solve the equation:
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
We can multiply both sides by $2(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominators:
$$2(x-3)\cdot\frac{x}{x-3}=2(x-3)\cdot\frac{2 x}{2}$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$2x=4(x-3)$$
Expanding the right side, we get:
$$2x=4x-12$$
Subtracting $2x$ from both sides, we get:
$$0=4x-2x-12$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$0=2x-12$$
Adding 12 to both sides, we get:
$$12=2x$$
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
$$x=6$$
To check if the solution satisfies the original equation, we substitute $x=6$ into the equation:
$$\frac{6}{6-3}=\frac{2\cdot6}{2}$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$2=6$$
This is not true, so $x=6$ is not a solution to the equation.

Therefore, the only possible value of $x$ that satisfies the equation is $x=0$. We can check this solution by substituting $x=0$ into the equation:
$$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2\cdot0}{2}$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$0=0$$
This is true, so $x=0$ is a solution to the equation.

We can also see that $x=4$ is a solution to the equation by substituting $x=4$ into the equation:
$$\frac{4}{4-3}=\frac{2\cdot4}{2}$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$4=4$$
This is true, so $x=4$ is a solution to the equation.

Therefore, the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $x=0$ and $x=4$, which is answer choice B.

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  The equipment is considered to have no monetary value after 12 years.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates at a rate of $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \ years} = \$ 2,700$ per year.
  After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by $4 \ years \times \$ 2,700/year = \$ 10,800$.

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's use the straight-line method to calculate the depreciation.
  The depreciation per year is ($32,400 - 0) / 12 = $2,700.
  After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by 4 * $2,700 = $10,800.

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  The depreciation rate is constant, which means it is linear.
  Let's use the straight-line depreciation method to calculate the depreciation rate.
  Straight-line depreciation rate = (Cost - Salvage value) / Useful life
  Cost = $\$ 32,400$
  Salvage value = $\$ 0$
  Useful life = 12 years
  Straight-line depreciation rate = ($\$ 32,400$ - $\$ 0$) / 12 years = $\$ 2,700$ per year
  After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by 4 * $\$ 2,700$ = $\$ 10,800$
  The current value of the equipment = Cost - Total depreciation
  Total depreciation = Depreciation rate * Number of years
  Total depreciation = $\$ 2,700$ * 4 years = $\$ 10,800$
  Current value of the equipment = $\$ 32,400$ - $\$ 10,800$ = $\$ 21,600$

  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's find the annual depreciation rate first.
  
  Annual depreciation rate = (Initial value - Residual value) / Useful life
  Residual value = $\$ 0$
  Useful life = 12 years
  Annual depreciation rate = ($\$ 32,400$ - $\$ 0$) / 12 years = $\$ 2,700$ per year

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, it is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's denote the value of the equipment after t years by V(t).
  We know that V(0) = 32,400 and V(12) = 0.
  Therefore, the slope of the line passing through (0, 32,400) and (12, 0) is (0 - 32,400) / (12 - 0) = -2,700.
  So the equation of the line is V(t) = -2,700t + 32,400.
  We need to find V(4), which is:
  V(4) = -2,700(4) + 32,400 = 21,600.

  The volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
  The height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$.
  The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.
  The volume of a cylinder is given by $\pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
  We can find the radius of the can by using the formula for the area of a circle: $A = \pi r^{2}$.
  Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$.
  The volume of the can is $\pi r^{2} h = \pi (4.33)^{2} (10) \approx 591.46 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
  Subtracting the volume of the syrup from the volume of the can gives us the volume of the fruit.

  The volume of the cylindrical can is $V_{can} = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the can.
  The area of the base of the can is $A_{base} = \pi r^2$.
  We can solve for $r$ using the given area of the base: $A_{base} = \pi r^2 = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. This gives us $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$.
  We can then solve for the volume of the can using the given height: $V_{can} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
  The volume of the syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so the volume of the fruit must be the difference between the volume of the can and the volume of the syrup: $V_{fruit} = V_{can} - V_{syrup} = 591.5 - 110 = 481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

  To do that, we need to isolate $t$ on one side of the equation.
  We can start by subtracting $1,052$ from both sides: $$a-1,052=1.08 t$$
  Then, we can divide both sides by $1.08$: $$\frac{a-1,052}{1.08}=t$$

  We have two equations:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  2 w+4 t &=14 \\
  4 w+5 t &=25

  We can solve this system of equations by elimination or substitution method.
  Let's use the elimination method:
  Multiply the first equation by $-2$ and add it to the second equation to eliminate $w$:
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
  -4 w-8 t &=-28 \\

  The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds should be linear.
  The function should have a slope that represents the rate of change of the shipping charge per pound of merchandise.
  The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in the shipping charge for two different weights and dividing by the difference in the weights.
  Using the data from the table, the slope is calculated as follows:
  slope = (shipping charge for 10 pounds - shipping charge for 5 pounds) / (10 - 5) = (21.89 - 16.94) / 5 = 0.99
  The y-intercept of the function represents the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0 pounds.
  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge for 0 pounds of merchandise is not given.
  However, we can use the slope and any point on the line to find the y-intercept.
  Let's use the point (5, 16.94) since it is the smallest weight given in the table.
  Using the point-slope form of a linear equation, we get:
  f(x) - 16.94 = 0.99(x - 5)
  f(x) = 0.99x - 4.95 + 16.94

  For example, the slope between 5 and 10 pounds is $(21.89-16.94)/(10-5)=0.99$.
  The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the merchandise weight is 0 pounds.
  We can find the y-intercept by looking at the table, or by setting $x=0$ in the equation and solving for $f(x)$.
  The y-intercept is $16.94$.
  Therefore, the function is $f(x)=0.99x+16.94$.

  The function that represents the linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is of the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the line is the rate of change of the shipping charge with respect to the weight of the merchandise, which is the same for any two points on the line.
  The y-intercept is the shipping charge when the weight of the merchandise is zero.
  Using the two given points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$, we can find the slope of the line as follows:
  $$m=\frac{\text{change in shipping charge}}{\text{change in merchandise weight}}=\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$$
  The y-intercept can be found by substituting one of the points into the equation $f(x)=mx+b$ and solving for $b$:
  $$16.94=0.99\times 5+b\Rightarrow b=11.99$$
  Therefore, the function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

  The relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is linear.
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation to represent the relationship.
  The slope of the line can be calculated by finding the change in y over the change in x between any two points on the line.
  The y-intercept of the line can be calculated by finding the value of y when x is zero.
  We can use the points (5, 16.94) and (40, 51.59) to find the slope of the line.
  Slope = (51.59 - 16.94) / (40 - 5) = 1.15.

  From the table, we can see that the shipping charge increases as the weight of the merchandise increases. This means that the slope of the function is positive.
  We can use the two points $(5,16.94)$ and $(40,51.59)$ to find the slope of the function.
  Slope $m=\frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}=\frac{51.59-16.94}{40-5}=0.99$
  We can substitute the slope and one of the points into the equation $y=mx+b$ to find the y-intercept.
  Using point $(5,16.94)$, we get $16.94=0.99(5)+b$, which gives $b=11.99$.

  To determine the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the line that passes through the points $(a, 0)$, $(3a, -a)$, and $(5a, -2a)$.
  The slope of the line is given by $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$, where $\Delta y$ is the change in $y$ and $\Delta x$ is the change in $x$.
  From the table, we can see that $\Delta x=2a$ and $\Delta y=-a$, so $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=-\frac{1}{2}$.

Let's first calculate the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants.
$36$ people out of $150$ participants chose the first picture in the set.
Therefore, the proportion of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants is $\frac{36}{150} = 0.24$.
Now, let's calculate the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants.
Let $p$ be the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants.
Therefore, the proportion of people who chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants is $\frac{p}{150}$.
The proportion of people who chose the first picture in the set among all 300 participants is:
$$\frac{36+p}{300}$$
We know that more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set. Therefore:
$$\frac{36+p}{300} > 0.20$$
$$36+p > 60$$
$$p > 24$$
Therefore, the possible values of $p$ are greater than $24$.
Now, let's look at the answer choices:
A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
$$p>0.20(300-36) = 52.8$$
This answer choice is incorrect because it allows $p$ to be less than or equal to $150$, which is not possible since there are only $150$ remaining participants.

Let's start by finding the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants. 
If 36 chose the first picture in the set, then the percentage of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants is:
$ \frac{36}{150} \times 100 = 24 \%$
Now, we need to find the minimum number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants for more than 20% of all participants to choose the first picture in the set.
If more than 20% of all participants chose the first picture in the set, then the percentage of people who chose the first picture in the set among all 300 participants is:
$20 \% = \frac{1}{5}$
Therefore, we need at least $\frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60$ people to choose the first picture in the set.
Since 36 people already chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants, we need at least 24 more people to choose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants.

  Let's first find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  Let's assume the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is x.
  Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x.
  We can calculate the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 by multiplying the number of subscriptions sold in 2012 by (1 + 2x/100).
  Similarly, we can calculate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 by multiplying the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 by (1 + x/100).
  We can then solve for x and find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
Calculation:
  Let's assume the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is y.
  Then, we have:
  5,880(1 + x/100) = y
  5,600(1 + 2x/100)(1 + x/100) = y
  We can simplify the second equation as follows:
  5,600(1 + 3x/100 + 2x^2/10000) = y
  5,600 + 168x + 112x^2 = 100y/3
  336x^2 + 168x - 100y/3 + 5,600 = 0
  Multiplying both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
  1008x^2 + 504x - 100y + 16,800 = 0
  Using the quadratic formula, we get:
  x = (-504 ± sqrt(504^2 - 4(1008)(-100y + 16,800))) / (2(1008))
  x = (-504 ± sqrt(254016 + 403200y - 67,584,000)) / 2016
  x = (-504 ± sqrt(403200y - 67,329,984)) / 2016
  Since x is a percent increase, it must be positive. Therefore, we take the positive root:
  x = (-504 + sqrt(403200y - 67,329,984)) / 2016
  We can now substitute this value of x into the first equation to find y:
  5,880(1 + (-504 + sqrt(403200y - 67,329,984)) / 2016) = y
  6,027.8 (rounded to the nearest tenth) = y

  Percent increase from 2012 to 2013 = (5,880 - 5,600) / 5,600 * 100% = 5%
  
  Let's assume the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is x%.
  According to the problem, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.

  Let's first find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
  We know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 
  $ \frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
  Let's assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $x\%$.
  Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2x\%$.
  We can use the following formula to find the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014:
  $\frac{\text{number of subscriptions sold in 2013}}{100+x} \times (100+2x) = \text{expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014}$
  Plugging in the values we know, we get:
  $\frac{5,880}{100+x} \times (100+2x) = \text{expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014}$
  Multiplying both sides by $100+x$ and simplifying, we get:
  $5,880 \times (1+\frac{x}{50}) = \text{expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014} \times (2+\frac{x}{50})$
  Expanding both sides and simplifying, we get:
  $x^2 + 100x - 14,400 = 0$
  Solving for $x$ using the quadratic formula, we get:
  $x = \frac{-100 + \sqrt{100^2 + 4 \times 14,400}}{2} \approx 60\%$
  Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is approximately 60%.
  The number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880.
  Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:
  $5,880 \times (1+\frac{60}{100}) \approx 9,408$
  However, this answer is not one of the choices, so we need to check our work.
  Let's try using the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 instead:
  $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
  Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{5\%}{2} = 2.5\%$.
  The expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

  We want to solve for 5,880 + 2 * 5,880 * x/100.
  We know that x = (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 * 100 = 5.
  Therefore, y = 2 * x = 10.
  We can now solve for 5,880 + 2 * 5,880 * x/100 = 6,027.

- Let's call the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 ""x"".
- We are told that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
- Let's call the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 ""a"" and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 ""b"".
- We know that: 
  - a = (5,880 - 5,600) / 5,600 = 0.05

- We can use the percent increase formula to relate the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and 2014:
  - (x - 5,880) / 5,880 = b
- Solving for x:
  - x - 5,880 = 5,880b
  - x = 5,880(1 + b)
  - x = 5,880(1 + 2a)
  - x = 5,880(1 + 2(0.05))

- However, we know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is equal to (5880 - 5600) / 5600 = 0.05 or 5%.
- We also know that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, we have:

- We need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014.
- Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is x/2.
- We can find the actual increase in subscriptions from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014.
- Then, we can use the percent increase to estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
- Actual increase from 2012 to 2013: 5,880 - 5,600 = 280
- Let y be the actual increase from 2013 to 2014.
- Then, we have y/280 = x/200
- Solving for y, we get y = 280x/200 = 14x/10
- Actual increase from 2013 to 2014: y = 14x/10
- Estimated subscriptions sold in 2014: 5,880 + 14x/10 = 5,880 + 7x/5

Now we need to find x:
- We know that x/2 is the percent increase from 2012 to 2013.
- Percent increase from 2012 to 2013: (5,880 - 5,600)/5,600 = 0.05
- So, x/2 = 0.1, which means x = 0.2

Finally, we can estimate the subscriptions sold in 2014:
- Subscriptions sold in 2014: 5,880 + 7x/5 = 6,468

  The white birch tree and the pin oak tree will grow at different rates.
  The formula for the diameter of a tree after $n$ years is $d_n=d_0+k\cdot n$, where $d_0$ is the initial diameter, $k$ is the growth rate, and $n$ is the number of years.
  Let $k_w$ and $k_p$ be the growth rates of the white birch tree and the pin oak tree, respectively.
  After 10 years, the diameter of the white birch tree will be $d_{w}=d_{0,w}+k_{w}\cdot 10$ and the diameter of the pin oak tree will be $d_{p}=d_{0,p}+k_{p}\cdot 10$.
  The difference in their diameters will be $d_{w}-d_{p}=(d_{0,w}-d_{0,p})+10(k_{w}-k_{p})$.
  Since the initial diameter of both trees is 1 foot, or 12 inches, we have $d_{0,w}-d_{0,p}=0$.
  Therefore, the difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $10(k_{w}-k_{p})$.
  We need to find the value of $10(k_{w}-k_{p})$.
  We know that the annual growth rate of a white birch tree is about 13 inches per year, and the annual growth rate of a pin oak tree is about 15 inches per year.
  Therefore, $k_{w}=1.083$ inches/year and $k_{p}=1.25$ inches/year.
  The difference in their growth rates is $k_{p}-k_{w}=0.167$ inches/year.
  Therefore, the difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $10(k_{p}-k_{w})=10(0.167)=1.67$ inches.

  Let's assume that the diameter of the white birch tree and the pin oak tree will increase by $r$ inches in 10 years.
  We know that the formula for the circumference of a circle is $C = 2\pi r$, where $C$ is the circumference and $r$ is the radius.
  We also know that the diameter is twice the radius, so $d = 2r$, where $d$ is the diameter.
  Therefore, $r = \frac{d}{2\pi}$.
  The difference in their diameters after 10 years will be $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}} = 2r_{\text{pin oak}} - 2r_{\text{white birch}}$.
  Substituting the formula for $r$ gives $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}} = \frac{d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}}}{\pi}$.
  Solving for $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}}$ gives $d_{\text{pin oak}} - d_{\text{white birch}} = \frac{d_{\text{pin oak}}}{\pi} - \frac{d_{\text{white birch}}}{\pi}$.

  Let d1 be the diameter of the white birch tree now.
  Let d2 be the diameter of the pin oak tree now.
  In general, the diameter of a tree increases as it grows.
  After 10 years, the diameter of each tree will have increased.
  Let d1' be the diameter of the white birch tree 10 years from now.
  Let d2' be the diameter of the pin oak tree 10 years from now.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now is d2' - d1'.
  We need to find an expression that approximates d2' - d1'.
  According to the problem, the rate of growth of the white birch tree is twice the rate of growth of the pin oak tree.
  Therefore, d1' = d1 + 2r and d2' = d2 + r, where r is the rate of growth of the pin oak tree.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now is d2' - d1' = (d2 + r) - (d1 + 2r) = d2 - d1 - r.
  We need to find an expression that approximates r.
  The formula for the approximate increase in diameter of a tree is given by r = k * d^{\frac{1}{2}}, where k is a constant and d is the diameter of the tree.
  Therefore, r1 = k * d1^{\frac{1}{2}} and r2 = k * d2^{\frac{1}{2}}.
  We need to find an expression that approximates r2 - r1.
  r2 - r1 = k * (d2^{\frac{1}{2}} - d1^{\frac{1}{2}}).
  We need to find an expression that approximates d2^{\frac{1}{2}} - d1^{\frac{1}{2}}.
  Using the binomial expansion, we have d2^{\frac{1}{2}} - d1^{\frac{1}{2}} = (\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2})(\sqrt{d2} - \sqrt{d1}) \approx (\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2})(\frac{1}{2}\frac{d2 - d1}{\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2}}) = \frac{d2 - d1}{2(\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2})}.
  Therefore, r2 - r1 \approx k * \frac{d2 - d1}{2(\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2})}.
  Finally, d2' - d1' \approx d2 - d1 - r2 + r1 \approx d2 - d1 - k * \frac{d2 - d1}{2(\sqrt{d1} + \sqrt{d2})} = (1 - \frac{k}{2} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{d1}} - \frac{k}{2} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{d2}}) * (d2 - d1).
  We need to find an expression that approximates the difference in inches of their diameters 10 years from now.
  d2' - d1' = (1 - \frac{k}{2} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{d1}} - \frac{k}{2} * \frac{1}{\sqrt{d2}}) * 12 * (d2 - d1).
  We can estimate k as follows: the problem states that the diameter of the white birch tree will be twice that of the pin oak tree after 10 years, so we have d1' = 2d2'. Substituting the expressions for d1' and d2', we get d1 + 2r = 2(d2 + r), which simplifies to r = \frac{d1 - 2d2}{3}.
  Substituting the expression for r into the formula for r1, we get r1 = k * d1^{\frac{1}{2}} = k * 12.
  Substituting the expression for r into the formula for r2, we get r2 = k * d2^{\frac{1}{2}} = k * 12 * \frac{d2^{\frac{1}{2}}}{d1^{\frac{1}{2}}}.
  Substituting the expressions for r1 and r2 into the expression for d2' - d1', we get d2' - d1' = (1 - \

  Then, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is $v = 120,000 - dt$.
  We need to find the equation that satisfies the given conditions.
  We can find the value of $d$ by using the initial and final values of the machine.
  $30,000 = 120,000 - 10d$
  $d = 9,000$
  Therefore, the equation that gives the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is $v = 120,000 - 9,000t$.

  The machine depreciates by the same amount each year.
  The value of the machine after 10 years is $\$ 30,000$.
  The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$.
  The total depreciation of the machine over 10 years is $\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000 = \$ 90,000$.
  Therefore, the amount of depreciation per year is $\$ 90,000 / 10 = \$ 9,000$.
  The value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is the initial value minus the depreciation, which is $\$ 120,000 - \$ 9,000 t$.

  The helicopter can carry a maximum of 9 packages if they are all 120-pound packages.
  However, the question states that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages.
  If the helicopter carries 9 packages of 120 pounds, the total weight would be 1,080 pounds.
  The remaining weight capacity for the last package would be 1,100 - 1,080 = 20 pounds.
  The helicopter can carry one 100-pound package to reach the minimum of 10 packages required.
  Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 8.
  The answer is not in the choices, so the most likely answer is C: 5.

To solve the problem, we need to use algebra.
Let x be the number of 100-pound packages.
Let y be the number of 120-pound packages.
We know that:
x + y >= 10 (the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages)
100x + 120y <= 1100 (the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds)
We want to find the maximum value of y.
We can solve the system of inequalities by graphing or substitution.
Let's use substitution:
From the first inequality, we have x >= 10 - y.
Substitute x by 10 - y in the second inequality:
100(10 - y) + 120y <= 1100
1000 - 100y + 120y <= 1100
20y <= 100
y <= 5

  Let's assume that the helicopter carries x number of 100-pound packages and y number of 120-pound packages.
  We know that the helicopter must carry at least 10 packages. Therefore, x + y >= 10.
  We also know that the total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds. Therefore, 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We want to find the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip, which is y.
  We can solve this problem by using the above two inequalities.
  First, we can simplify the weight inequality by dividing both sides by 20. We get 5x + 6y <= 55.
  Next, we can solve for x in the first inequality by subtracting y from both sides. We get x >= 10 - y.
  Now we can substitute this expression for x in the weight inequality. We get 5(10 - y) + 6y <= 55.
  Simplifying this inequality, we get 10y <= 5. Therefore, y <= 0.5.
  Since y is the number of 120-pound packages, it must be a whole number. Therefore, the maximum number of 120-pound packages that the helicopter can carry per trip is 0.

  Let's assume the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
  We need to find the maximum number of 120-pound packages the helicopter can carry per trip.
  The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y >= 10.
  The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y <= 1,100.
  We need to maximize y.
  Let's solve the system of inequalities:
  x + y >= 10
  100x + 120y <= 1,100
  We can rewrite the first inequality as y >= -x + 10.
  We can graph the system of inequalities to find the feasible region.
  The feasible region is a polygon with vertices (0, 10), (6, 4), (11, 0), and (0, 0).
  We need to maximize y = (1/120)(1,100 - 100x).
  The maximum value of y occurs at (6, 4) and is equal to 4.

Simplifying the equation, we get $0.08x = 0.4x$, which gives us $x = \frac{0.4x}{0.08} = 5x$.
Therefore, the original price of the property is $x = \frac{1}{5}$ times the price Townsend Realty paid for the property.
So, the original price of the property is $\frac{1}{5}(0.48x) = 0.096x$ dollars.
Now, we can approximate the value of $x$ by looking at the answer choices.
$0.096x \approx 0.1x$.
Therefore, we need to choose the answer choice that is closest to $0.1x$.

- We are looking for the probability of choosing a person who belongs to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream.
- We can use the formula for conditional probability: P(Y|1 or more dream) = P(Y and 1 or more dream) / P(1 or more dream)
- We can find P(Y and 1 or more dream) by adding the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 or more dreams, which is 11 + 68 = 79.
- We can find P(1 or more dream) by adding the number of people in Group X and Y who recalled 1 or more dreams, which is 28 + 57 + 11 + 68 = 164.
- Therefore, P(Y|1 or more dream) = (11 + 68) / (28 + 57 + 11 + 68) = 79 / 164.

  The mean of List B is $\frac{2+3+3+4+4+5}{6}=3.5$.
  The standard deviation of List A is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i=1}^{6}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}=\sqrt{\frac{35}{12}}\approx1.71$.
  The standard deviation of List B is $\sqrt{\frac{1}{6}\sum_{i=1}^{6}(y_i-\bar{y})^2}=\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\approx1.29$.
  Therefore, the means are the same, and the standard deviations are different.

  We are given that the granola bar has 180 food calories.
  We are also given the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate.
  Let $p$ be the number of grams of protein in the granola bar.
  Let $f$ be the number of grams of fat in the granola bar.
  Let $c$ be the number of grams of carbohydrate in the granola bar.
  The total number of food calories in the granola bar is $4p+9f+4c$.
  We know that the total number of food calories in the granola bar is 180.
  Therefore, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$.
  We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $9f=180-4p-4c$.
  Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}p-\frac{4}{9}c$.

  The vertex of a parabola is located at the point where the derivative of the function is zero.
  We can find the derivative of $f(x)$ by using the product rule: $f'(x)=(x+1)+(x+3)=2x+4$.
  We set $f'(x)=0$ to find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex: $2x+4=0 \Rightarrow x=-2$.
  Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-2$.
  The answer is not A or D since $-2$ is not in those intervals.

  We can then use the formula for exponential decay to find the population at the end of the last 20-year period, and then multiply that by the decay factor raised to the power of the number of years that have passed since the end of the last 20-year period.
  The answer is D: $50,000(0.9)^{\frac{t}{20}}$.

Let's say the original length and width of the rectangle are $l$ and $w$, respectively. 
The original area of the rectangle is $A_1=lw$.
After the length is increased by 10%, the new length becomes $1.1l$.
After the width is decreased by $p$%, the new width becomes $(1-\frac{p}{100})w$.
The new area of the rectangle is $A_2=1.1l(1-\frac{p}{100})w$.
It is given that the new area is 12% less than the original area. 
So, $A_2=0.88A_1$.
Substituting the expressions of $A_1$ and $A_2$, we get:

Let the original length and width of the rectangle be L and W, respectively.
The original area of the rectangle is A = L*W.
After the alterations, the new length is 1.1L and the new width is (1-p/100)W.
The new area of the rectangle is 0.88A = (1.1L)*(1-p/100)W.
We can solve for p by setting up an equation and solving for p.
0.88A = (1.1L)*(1-p/100)W
0.88(L*W) = (1.1L)*(1-p/100)W
0.88L = 1.1(1-p/100)W
0.8L = (1-p/100)W
100(0.8L) = (100-p)W
80L = (100-p)W
p = 100 - 80L/W
We know that the area decreased by 12 percent, so:
0.88A = 0.88(L*W) = 0.88(80L) = 70.4L
And we know that L/W = 4/3 (since the original rectangle is a rectangle).
L = 4x, W = 3x for some x > 0.
So p = 100 - 80L/W = 100 - 80(4x)/(3x) = 100 - 106.67 = -6.67.
Since p must be a positive number, we can conclude that none of the given answer choices is correct.

  The expanded form of the left side of the equation is $a b x^{2}+(7 a+2 b) x+14$.
  We can see that $ab=15$ and $7a+2b=c$.
  We need to find two possible values of $c$.
  We can try different pairs of factors of 15 that add up to 8, and calculate the corresponding values of $c$.
  The pairs are (1,15), (3,5), and (5,3).

  The relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is represented by a linear function.
  The function is of the form $r(p)=mp+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can find the slope $m$ by calculating the change in $r$ divided by the change in $p$ for any two points on the line.
  For example, using the points $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$:
  $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=\frac{360}{48}=7.5$

  We can use the formula for the equation of a line, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept, to find the linear function that represents the relationship.
  The slope of the line represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price.
  We can calculate the slope by finding the change in monthly rental price divided by the change in purchase price between any two points on the line.
  We can use the points (128, 950) and (176, 1310) from the table to find the slope.
  The change in monthly rental price is 1310 - 950 = 360, and the change in purchase price is 176 - 128 = 48.
  Therefore, the slope is 360 / 48 = 7.5.

  Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds.
  Let's calculate his speed: speed = distance / time = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds.
  We can simplify this fraction by multiplying both numerator and denominator by 10 to get 250 meters / 137 seconds.
  Now we can use this speed to calculate the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds):
  distance = speed * time = (250 meters / 137 seconds) * 240 seconds.
  We can simplify this expression by canceling out the seconds: distance = (250 meters / 137) * 240.
  Let's round this to the nearest whole number to make it easier to compare with the answer choices.
  250 * 240 / 137 is approximately equal to 435 meters.

  $$\begin{aligned}& 4 x-6 y=-28 \\& 9 x-6 y=-18\end{aligned}$$
  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:
  $$-5x=-10$$
  Therefore, $x=2$.
  Substituting $x=2$ in the second equation, we get:
  $$3(2)-2y=-6$$
  Solving for $y$, we get $y=6$.
  Therefore, $x-y=2-6=-4$.
  The answer is C: -4.

  We need to isolate $v$ in terms of $h$, $t$, and $k$.
  Rearranging the equation, we get $v t = -\frac{1}{2} g t^2 + h - k$.
  Dividing both sides by $t$, we get $v = -\frac{1}{2} g t + \frac{h-k}{t}$.
  Substituting $g=16$, we get $v = -8 t + \frac{h-k}{t}$.

  If the system of equations has no solution, then the two lines are parallel.
  We can find the slope of each line by rearranging each equation into slope-intercept form.
  The slope-intercept form of a line is $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  The slope of the first equation is $\frac{k}{3}$.
  The slope of the second equation is $\frac{4}{5}$.
  If the two lines are parallel, then their slopes are equal, which means:
  $$\frac{k}{3} = \frac{4}{5}$$
  Solving for $k$:
  $$k = \frac{12}{5}$$

  We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
  Multiply the first equation by 4 and the second equation by $-k$.
  We get $4kx-12y=16$ and $-4kx+5y=-7k$.
  Add the two equations to eliminate $x$ and get $-7y=16-7k$.
  Divide both sides by $-7$ to get $y=\frac{16}{7}-k$.
  Substitute $y$ in the first equation to get $kx-3(\frac{16}{7}-k)=4$.
  Simplify to get $kx=\frac{12}{7}+4k$.
  Divide both sides by $k$ to get $x=\frac{12}{7k}+4$.

  Simplify to get $\frac{48}{7k}-20+\frac{80}{7}-5k=7$.
  Simplify further to get $k^2-\frac{16}{7}k+\frac{48}{35}=0$.
  Use the quadratic formula to solve for $k$: $k=\frac{\frac{16}{7}\pm\sqrt{(\frac{16}{7})^2-4(\frac{1}{1})(\frac{48}{35})}}{2(\frac{1}{1})}$.
  Simplify to get $k=\frac{8}{7}\pm\frac{4\sqrt{6}}{7}$.

  We can solve the system of equations using elimination method.
  Multiply the first equation by 5 and the second equation by 3.

  Subtracting the second equation from the first equation gives us $(5k-12)x= -1y+20-21$.
  Simplifying this gives us $(5k-12)x=-y-1$.
  For the system to have no solution, the coefficients of $x$ and $y$ on the left-hand side must be proportional.
  Therefore, we need $\frac{5k-12}{-1}=\frac{-y-1}{x}$.
  Rearranging this gives us $y=-5k+12x-1$.
  Substituting this into the second equation gives us $4x-5(-5k+12x-1)=7$.
  Simplifying this gives us $49x-25k=12$.
  Solving for $k$ gives us $k=\frac{49x-12}{25}$.
  Therefore, for the system to have no solution, $k$ must be such that $\frac{49x-12}{25}$ has no solution for $x$.

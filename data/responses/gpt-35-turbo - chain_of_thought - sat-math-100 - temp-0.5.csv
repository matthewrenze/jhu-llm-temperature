  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  This means that the equipment depreciates $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$ per year.
  After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated $\$ 2,700 \times 4 = \$ 10,800$.

  The camera equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, it is considered to have no monetary value.
  Let's assume the depreciation rate is constant over the 12 years.
  Let's call the value of the equipment after t years V(t).
  Since the depreciation rate is constant over 12 years, we can find the rate by dividing the initial value by 12.
  The initial value is $\$ 32,400$, so the depreciation rate is $\frac{32,400}{12} = \$ 2,700$ per year.
  Therefore, V(t) = 32,400 - 2,700t.
  We want to know the value of the equipment after 4 years, so we plug in t = 4 into the formula for V(t).
  V(4) = 32,400 - 2,700(4) = 32,400 - 10,800 = $\$ 21,600$.

  The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years.
  After 12 years, the equipment is considered to have no monetary value.
  Therefore, the equipment depreciates linearly over 12 years.
  Let's find the depreciation rate per year: depreciation = (initial value - final value) / years
  depreciation = ($\$ 32,400$ - $\$ 0$) / 12 = $\$ 2,700$ per year.
  After 4 years, the equipment's value is: value = initial value - (depreciation rate per year * number of years)
  value = $\$ 32,400$ - ($\$ 2,700$ * 4) = $\$ 21,600$

- The can is in the shape of a cylinder, so its volume can be calculated as $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cylinder and $h$ is its height.
- We are given the area of the base of the can as $75\text{ cm}^2$, so we can find the radius as $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33\text{ cm}$.
- We are also given the height of the can as $10\text{ cm}$.
- The total volume of the can filled with syrup is $110\text{ cm}^3$, which is also the volume of the cylinder. So we can use this to find the radius of the surface of the syrup as it fills the can.
- The volume of the syrup is $V_{\text{syrup}} = \pi r^2 h_{\text{syrup}}$, where $h_{\text{syrup}}$ is the height of the syrup.
- We can find $h_{\text{syrup}}$ as $h_{\text{syrup}} = \frac{V_{\text{syrup}}}{\pi r^2} = \frac{110}{\pi \cdot (4.33)^2} \approx 1.47\text{ cm}$.
- The height of the fruit in the can is then $h_{\text{fruit}} = h - h_{\text{syrup}} = 10 - 1.47 \approx 8.53\text{ cm}$.

  The equation is true for all $x$.
  We can expand the left-hand side of the equation and then compare the coefficients of each term with the right-hand side of the equation.
  To get $20x^3$ on the right-hand side, we need to have $(a x)(5x^2)$ on the left-hand side.
  To get $-9x^2$ on the right-hand side, we need to have $(3)(-bx)(5x^2)$ on the left-hand side.

  Using the given data, we can find the slope $m$ and the y-intercept $b$.
  The slope is the change in shipping charge divided by the change in weight, or the rate of change in shipping charge with respect to weight.

Let's start by calculating the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants.
36 people chose the first picture in the set among the first 150 participants.
So, the percentage of people who chose the first picture among the first 150 participants is $\frac{36}{150} \approx 0.24$.
Now, let's calculate the number of people who chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants.
Let's assume that $p$ people chose the first picture in the set among the remaining 150 participants.
So, the percentage of people who chose the first picture among the remaining 150 participants is $\frac{p}{150}$.
The total percentage of people who chose the first picture in the set is $\frac{36+p}{300}$.
If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, then $\frac{36+p}{300} > 0.20$.
We can simplify this inequality to $p > 0.20(300-36)$.

  The slope of the line can be determined using the formula $m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are two points on the line.
  If the line passes through the origin, then $b = 0$.

  Substituting the coordinates of the two points, we get the following system of equations:

  One column of 50 one-cent coins is approximately $3 \frac{7}{8}$ inches tall.
  Therefore, one coin is approximately $\frac{3 \frac{7}{8}}{50}$ inches tall.
  To calculate the number of coins needed to make an 8-inch-tall column, we can divide 8 by the height of one coin.
  $\frac{8}{\frac{3 \frac{7}{8}}{50}} = \frac{8 \cdot 50}{3 \frac{7}{8}} \approx 390$

  The expected increase in subscriptions from 2013 to 2014 is (1 + y/100)*5,880.

  The white birch tree and the pin oak tree will grow at different rates.
  White birch trees grow at a rate of approximately 1-2 feet per year.
  Pin oak trees grow at a rate of approximately 1-2 feet per year.
  The difference in their growth rates is not significant.
  The difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be approximately the same as their growth rates.

  We can use the formula $d = rt$ to solve this problem.
  The question is asking us to find the difference in the diameters of the trees 10 years from now.
  We know that the diameter of each tree is currently 1 foot, or 12 inches.
  We need to find the rate at which each tree grows in diameter.
  According to the problem, we don't know the exact rate of growth for each tree, but we do know that one tree is a white birch and the other is a pin oak.
  We can assume that the white birch and the pin oak have different rates of growth.
  Let's say that the white birch grows at a rate of $r_1$ inches per year, and the pin oak grows at a rate of $r_2$ inches per year.
  Then, the diameter of the white birch 10 years from now will be $12 + 10r_1$ inches, and the diameter of the pin oak 10 years from now will be $12 + 10r_2$ inches.
  Therefore, the difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be $(12 + 10r_1) - (12 + 10r_2) = 10(r_1 - r_2)$ inches.
  We don't know $r_1$ or $r_2$, but we can use the answer choices to estimate the difference in their growth rates.
  If we assume that the difference in their growth rates is between 0.1 inches per year and 0.2 inches per year, then the difference in their diameters 10 years from now will be between 1.0 inches and 1.9 inches.
  The answer that is closest to this range is C: 1.3.

Therefore, the ordered pair is $\left(-\frac{7}{5},\frac{8}{5}\right)$.
We can check that this ordered pair satisfies both equations in the system:

To maximize the number of 120-pound packages, the helicopter should carry the maximum number of 120-pound packages that meet the weight limit.
Let's assume that the helicopter carries x 100-pound packages and y 120-pound packages.
So the weight of the cargo is 100x + 120y.
The helicopter must carry at least 10 packages, so x + y ≥ 10.
The total weight of the packages can be at most 1,100 pounds, so 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100.
To maximize y, we need to solve for y in the inequality 100x + 120y ≤ 1,100:
  120y ≤ 1,100 - 100x
  y ≤ (1,100 - 100x) / 120
  y ≤ (11 - x) / 12
Since y must be an integer, the maximum value of y occurs when (11 - x) is a multiple of 12 and y is the quotient of (11 - x) / 12.
The largest multiple of 12 that is less than or equal to 11 is 0, so x = 11 and y = 1.

  Since $f(x)$ is defined by a polynomial, we can determine the degree of the polynomial by counting the number of data points given. Since there are four data points, the degree of the polynomial is at most $3$.
  We can use these data points to write out a system of equations to solve for the coefficients of the polynomial.
  One possible way to do this is to use the factored form of the polynomial:
  $$f(x) = a(x-0)(x-2)(x-4)(x-5)$$
  where $a$ is a constant to be determined.
  Substituting the given data points into the factored form, we get the following system of equations:
  \begin{align*}
  f(0) &= a(0-0)(0-2)(0-4)(0-5) = 3\\
  f(2) &= a(2-0)(2-2)(2-4)(2-5) = 1\\
  f(4) &= a(4-0)(4-2)(4-4)(4-5) = 0\\
  f(5) &= a(5-0)(5-2)(5-4)(5-5) = -2\\
  \end{align*}
  Simplifying each equation, we get:
  \begin{align*}
  0 &= -120a\\
  2 &= -12a\\
  0 &= 0\\
  -2 &= -15a\\
  \end{align*}
  Solving for $a$, we get $a = -\frac{1}{15}$.
  Therefore, the polynomial is:
  $$f(x) = -\frac{1}{15}(x-0)(x-2)(x-4)(x-5)$$
  To determine which of the given choices must be a factor of $f(x)$, we can check if $f$ has a root at each of the given values of $x$.
  \begin{align*}
  f(2) &= -\frac{1}{15}(2-0)(2-2)(2-4)(2-5) = 1\\
  f(3) &= -\frac{1}{15}(3-0)(3-2)(3-4)(3-5) = -\frac{2}{5}\\
  f(4) &= -\frac{1}{15}(4-0)(4-2)(4-4)(4-5) = 0\\
  f(5) &= -\frac{1}{15}(5-0)(5-2)(5-4)(5-5) = \frac{2}{3}\\
  \end{align*}
  Since $f(2) = 1$, $f(4) = 0$, and $f(5) = \frac{2}{3}$, $x-2$, $x-4$, and $x-5$ must be factors of $f(x)$.

  The slope of the function $f$ is the same between any two points in the table.
  The slope of the function $f$ can be calculated by choosing any two points and calculating the change in $f(x)$ over the change in $x$.
  For example, the slope between the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $(13-5)/(3-1)=4$.
  Therefore, the slope of the function $f$ is 4.
  The function $f$ can be written as $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept.
  To find $b$, we can substitute $x=1$ and $f(x)=5$ into the equation $f(x)=mx+b$ and solve for $b$.
  We get $5=m(1)+b$, which simplifies to $b=5-m$.

  To determine the value of $m$, we can substitute any of the other two points into the equation $f(x)=mx+5-m$ and solve for $m$.

  We need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.
  We can solve for $t$ in the given formula by subtracting 1,052 from both sides and then dividing by 1.08.
  That gives us $t=\frac{a-1,052}{1.08}$.
  To find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000, we need to substitute $a=1,000$ into this equation and round to the nearest whole number.
  We can do this for each of the answer choices and see which one gives us the smallest absolute difference between $a$ and 1,000.
  Alternatively, we can use estimation to eliminate some answer choices.
  If $t$ decreases by 10 degrees, $a$ increases by 8.8 feet per second (since $1.08 \times 10 = 8.8$).
  Therefore, if we want $a$ to decrease by 52 feet per second (since $1,052 - 1,000 = 52$), we need $t$ to decrease by approximately 6 degrees.
  Answer choice A is too far from $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, which is the temperature at which the speed of sound is approximately 1,000 feet per second.
  Answer choice B is also too far from $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.
  Answer choice C is closer to $-40^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ than answer choice D, so we can eliminate answer choice D.

  $t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{1.08} \approx -48.15$, which rounds to $-48$.

  The population of the city will decrease by 10% every 20 years.
  The present population of the city is 50,000.
  To find the population of the city $t$ years from now, we need to use exponential decay formula.
  The formula for exponential decay is $A = A_0 r^t$, where $A$ is the final amount, $A_0$ is the initial amount, $r$ is the rate of decay, and $t$ is the time.
  Since the population is decreasing, the rate of decay is less than 1. 
  The formula becomes $A = A_0 (1 - r)^t$.
  Since the population is decreasing by 10%, the rate of decay is 0.1.

  We also know that $a+b=8$, so we can solve for $a$ and $b$ using substitution.
  $$a=8-b$$
  $$b=8-a$$
  Substituting these expressions into the first equation, we get:
  $$ab=(8-a)(8-b)=15$$
  Solving for $b$ in terms of $a$, we get:
  $$b=8-a$$
  $$a(8-a)=15$$
  $$a^{2}-8a+15=0$$
  $$(a-3)(a-5)=0$$
  $$a=3,5$$
  Substituting these values of $a$ into $b=8-a$, we get:
  $$a=3 \Rightarrow b=5$$
  $$a=5 \Rightarrow b=3$$
  Finally, we can solve for $c$ using the second equation:
  $$7a+2b-c=0$$
  $$a=3, b=5 \Rightarrow c=21$$
  $$a=5, b=3 \Rightarrow c=21$$
  Therefore, the two possible values for $c$ are 21.

  We can expand the left side of the equation and match the coefficients with the given right side of the equation to get the value of $c$.
  The left side of the equation is $(a x+2)(b x+7) = abx^{2} + (7a+2b)x + 14$.
  Comparing coefficients, we get:
  $ab = 15$,
  $7a+2b = c$.
  We have two equations and two variables. We can solve for $a$ and $b$ and then find the value of $c$.
  From the first equation, we get $b = \frac{15}{a}$.
  Substituting this in the second equation, we get $7a + 2\left(\frac{15}{a}\right) = c$.
  Simplifying, we get $7a^{2} - ca + 30 = 0$.
  Solving for $a$ using the quadratic formula, we get $a = \frac{c \pm \sqrt{c^{2}-840}}{14}$.
  Since $a$ and $b$ are both positive, we can discard the negative root.
  Also, we know that $a+b=8$, so we get $\frac{c + \sqrt{c^{2}-840}}{14} + \frac{15}{\frac{c + \sqrt{c^{2}-840}}{14}} = 8$.
  Simplifying, we get $2c^{2} - 119c + 210 = 0$.
  Solving for $c$ using the quadratic formula, we get $c = \frac{119 \pm \sqrt{119^{2} - 4(2)(210)}}{4}$.

  We can use the distributive property to expand the left-hand side of the equation.

  We can compare the coefficients of the quadratic term and the constant term on both sides of the equation.
  $ab = 15$ and $14 = 14$
  We know that $a + b = 8$, so we can solve for $b$ in terms of $a$.
  $b = 8 - a$
  Substituting $b$ in terms of $a$ into the equation $ab = 15$ gives us a quadratic equation in terms of $a$.
  $a(8 - a) = 15$
  $-a^{2} + 8a - 15 = 0$
  Factoring the quadratic equation gives us:

  We can solve this problem by expanding the left-hand side of the equation and comparing it with the right-hand side of the equation.
  
  Expanding the left-hand side of the equation:
  
  $(a x+2)(b x+7) = ab x^2 + (7a+2b) x + 14$
  
  Comparing with the right-hand side of the equation:
  
  $ab=15$ and $7a+2b=c$
  
  We are given that $a+b=8$.
  
  We can use substitution to solve for $a$ and $b$ in terms of $c$.
  
  Solving for $a$ in terms of $b$ from $a+b=8$, we get $a=8-b$.
  
  Substituting $a=8-b$ into $7a+2b=c$, we get $7(8-b)+2b=c$.
  
  Simplifying the equation, we get $c=56-5b$.
  
  We can substitute $ab=15$ into $ab=15$ and solve for $b$ to get $b=\frac{15}{a}$.
  
  Substituting $b=\frac{15}{a}$ into $a+b=8$, we get $a+\frac{15}{a}=8$.
  
  Multiplying both sides by $a$, we get $a^2+15=8a$.
  
  Rearranging the equation, we get $a^2-8a+15=0$.
  
  Factoring the equation, we get $(a-3)(a-5)=0$.
  
  Therefore, $a=3$ or $a=5$.
  
  Substituting $a=3$ into $b=\frac{15}{a}$, we get $b=5$.
  
  Substituting $a=5$ into $b=\frac{15}{a}$, we get $b=3$.
  
  Substituting $a=3$ and $b=5$ into $c=56-5b$, we get $c=31$.
  
  Substituting $a=5$ and $b=3$ into $c=56-5b$, we get $c=21$.

  The function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price must be linear.
  We need to find the linear function in the form of $r(p)=mp+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept.
  We can find the slope $m$ by calculating the change in $r$ divided by the change in $p$ for any two points.
  Let's use the points (128, 950) and (176, 1310) to find the slope $m$.

  We can use the formula of the slope-intercept form of a linear function, y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.
  We can find the slope by using the formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), where (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) are two points on the line.
  We can use two points from the table: (128, 950) and (450, 3365).
  The slope m is then (3365 - 950) / (450 - 128) = 2415 / 322 = 7.5.

  We are given the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price.
  We are asked to find the linear function that represents this relationship.
  We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function (y = mx + b) to represent the relationship.
  We need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the function.
  The slope is equal to the change in y divided by the change in x.
  In this case, the change in y is the change in the monthly rental price, and the change in x is the change in the purchase price.
  We can use any two points from the table to find the slope of the function.
  Let's use the points (128, 950) and (176, 1310).
  The change in y is 1310 - 950 = 360.
  The change in x is 176 - 128 = 48.
  Therefore, the slope of the function is 360/48 = 7.5.
  To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the points and the slope.
  Let's use the point (128, 950).
  We know that the monthly rental price is 950 when the purchase price is 128.
  We also know that the slope of the function is 7.5.
  Using the slope-intercept form of a linear function, we can write:
  r(p) = 7.5p + b

  We can substitute the values of p and r(p) from the point (128, 950) to find b.
  950 = 7.5(128) + b
  950 = 960 + b
  b = -10
  Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is:

  Clearwater Lane: $p=128$, $r=950$

  The slope of the function is given by: $m = \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = 6$

  We can calculate the slope of the function by finding the change in $r$ divided by the change in $p$.

  Let's calculate the slope of the function:
  
  Slope $m = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p} = \frac{r_2 - r_1}{p_2 - p_1}$
  
  We can pick two points from the table, say $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$
  
  $m = \frac{3365 - 950}{450 - 128} = \frac{2415}{322} \approx 7.5$
  
  So we know that the slope of the function is approximately 7.5.
  
  Let's use the point $(128, 950)$ to find the y-intercept $b$:
  
  $950 = 7.5 \cdot 128 + b$
  
  $b = 950 - 7.5 \cdot 128 = -10$
  
  So we know that the y-intercept of the function is -10.
  
  Now we can write the function in slope-intercept form:
  
  $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$
  
  Let's check if this function fits the given information by plugging in the purchase price of each property:
  
  $r(128) = 7.5 \cdot 128 - 10 = 950$ (matches the given rental price)
  
  $r(176) = 7.5 \cdot 176 - 10 = 1310$ (matches the given rental price)
  
  $r(70) = 7.5 \cdot 70 - 10 = 515$ (matches the given rental price)

  We can then solve for y and substitute the value of y in either of the original equations to solve for x.
  Once we have the values of x and y, we can find the value of $x-y$.

  $h=-16 t^{2}-32t+k$
  Rearranging this equation, we get,
  $-16 t^{2}-32t+(h-k)=0$
  We can solve this quadratic equation for t using the quadratic formula.
  $t=\frac{-(-32)\pm\sqrt{(-32)^{2}-4(-16)(h-k)}}{2(-16)}$
  Simplifying this equation, we get,
  $t=\frac{1}{32}(1\pm\sqrt{1-2(h-k)})$
  Since the ball is thrown upwards, we can ignore the negative value of t.
  Therefore, $t=\frac{1}{32}(1+\sqrt{1-2(h-k)})$
  We can substitute this value of t in the equation $v=-32t$ to get the answer.
  $v=-32\times\frac{1}{32}(1+\sqrt{1-2(h-k)})$
  Simplifying this equation, we get,

  $$2x(x - 5) = 0$$
  $$x = 0, 5/2$$
  However, $x = 5/2$ does not satisfy the original equation because $\frac{5/2}{5/2 - 3} \neq \frac{2(5/2)}{2}$.

  If $k=\frac{16}{7}$ or $k=-\frac{16}{7}$, then $ky$ will be equal to a non-zero number, and we can solve for $y$.
  If $k\neq \frac{16}{7}$ and $k\neq -\frac{16}{7}$, then we can divide both sides by $ky$ to get:

  Since $ky$ is not equal to $0$, we can solve for $k$:
  $$k=\frac{16}{7}-\frac{7}{y}$$

  Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get:

  Factoring out $y$, we get:

  If $7k-12=0$, then we have $0\cdot y=16-7k$, which is impossible unless $16-7k=0$ as well. But if $16-7k=0$, then $k=\frac{16}{7}$, which is not an option for this question.
  Therefore, $7k-12\neq 0$ and we can divide both sides by $7k-12$:
  $$y=\frac{16-7k}{7k-12}$$
  Substituting this expression for $y$ into the first equation, we get:

We can solve the system of equations using elimination method. 

Multiplying the first equation by 4, we get $4kx - 12y = 16$

Multiplying the second equation by $k$, we get $4kx - 5ky = 7k$

Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $-7ky = 16 - 7k$

Dividing both sides by $-7$, we get $y = \frac{7k - 16}{7}$

Substituting the value of $y$ in the second equation, we get $4x - 5\left(\frac{7k - 16}{7}\right) = 7$

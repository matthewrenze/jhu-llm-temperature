gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,0,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them, or 75 employees, take a winter vacation. 40% of them, or 40 employees, take both a winter and a summer vacation. And 20% of them, or 20 employees, take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation. 

The number of employees who take only a summer vacation is equal to the total number of employees who take a summer vacation minus the number of employees who take both vacations: 

Total summer vacationers - Both vacations = Only summer vacation 

100% - 20% - 40% = 40% 

So, 40% of the employees take only a summer vacation. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer(""B"") 15%

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,1,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.

If 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, then 40% of the employees who take a summer vacation also take a winter vacation. 

Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is:

Let's find the number of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation. This can be found by subtracting the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations from the total number of employees who take a winter vacation: 

75 - 40 = 35 

Now, let's find the number of employees who take a summer vacation: 

100 - 20 = 80 

Finally, we can find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation by subtracting the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations and the number of employees who take a winter vacation but not a summer vacation from the total number of employees who take a summer vacation: 

80 - 40 - 35 = 5

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,3,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
Given that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, 25% of the employees do not take a winter vacation.
Out of these 25%, 20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. Therefore, 5% of the employees take only a summer vacation.
Now, we know that 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation. So, the percentage of employees who take both winter and summer vacations is 40%.
Therefore, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is 40% - 5% = 35%.

Given, 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation. So, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations.
Given, 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. So, 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations.
Let's assume that Q% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. So, x employees take only summer vacation.
Total employees who take summer vacation = Employees who take both summer and winter vacation + Employees who take only summer vacation
=> 40 + x
Total employees = Employees who take winter vacation + Employees who take both summer and winter vacation + Employees who take only summer vacation + Employees who take neither winter nor summer vacation

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,5,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. 

According to the problem, 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation. 

40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations. 

20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation. 

We can use this information to find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. 

Let's start by finding out how many employees take a summer vacation in total. 

If 40% take both vacations, then 60% take only a winter or only a summer vacation. 

If 20% take neither vacation, then 80% take at least one vacation. 

So, 80% of 100 employees is 80 employees who take at least one vacation. 

If 75 employees take a winter vacation, then 80 - 75 = 5 employees take only a summer vacation. 

Therefore, the answer is 5% or choice A.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,6,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75 employees take a winter vacation, 40 employees take both winter and summer vacations, and 20 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations. 

Let's find out how many employees take at least one vacation: 

75 employees take a winter vacation 
40 employees take both winter and summer vacations 
So, a total of 75 + 40 = 115 employees take a winter vacation or a summer vacation (or both). 

Therefore, 100 - 20 = 80 employees take at least one vacation. 

Now, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation: 

40 employees take both winter and summer vacations 
So, a total of 40 employees take a summer vacation. 

Finally, let's find out how many employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation: 

This is equal to the number of employees who take a summer vacation minus the number of employees who take both winter and summer vacations: 

40 - 40 = 0 

So, 0 percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,7,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. Therefore, 100 - 75 - 20 = 5 employees take only a winter vacation. 

Now, 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, which is 40 employees. Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is 40 + Q. 

We know that the total number of employees is 100, so we can set up the equation: 

75 (winter) + 40 (both) + 20 (neither) + 5 (only winter) + Q (only summer) = 100 

Simplifying this equation, we get: 

Q = 15 

Therefore, the answer is 15%, which is choice B.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,8,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them take a winter vacation, which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which is 20 employees. So, the remaining 5% of them (5 employees) do not take a winter vacation but take either a summer vacation or both. 

Now, we know that 40% of the employees take both winter and summer vacations, which is 40 employees. Therefore, the number of employees who take a summer vacation is (40 - 5) = 35 employees. 

So, the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation is (35/100) * 100 = 35%.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,7,9,"Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company. Then, 75% of them, or 75 employees, take a winter vacation. 40% of the employees, or 40 employees, take both a winter and a summer vacation. And 20% of the employees, or 20 employees, take neither a winter nor a summer vacation. 

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we can use the formula:

Q = (% taking summer vacation) - (% taking both summer and winter vacation)

We know that 20 employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, so the remaining 80 employees must have taken either a winter or a summer vacation or both. 

If 75 employees took a winter vacation, then 80 - 75 = 5 employees must have taken only a summer vacation or both a summer and winter vacation. 

If 40 employees took both a winter and a summer vacation, then 5 employees must have taken only a summer vacation. 

Therefore, Q = 5%, so the answer is (A) 5%.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,63,0,"Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, then 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.2,66,3,"To solve this problem, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line. The equation of a line with slope $m$ passing through the point $(x_1,y_1)$ is given by:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

In this case, we know that the line passes through the origin, so $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = 0$. We also know that the slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:

$y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$

Simplifying, we get:

$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now we can check which of the given points lie on this line by substituting their coordinates into this equation and seeing if the equation is true.

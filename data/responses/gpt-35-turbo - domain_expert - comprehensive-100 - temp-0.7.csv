gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,7,0,"Let W be the number of people taking a winter vacation, S be the number of people taking a summer vacation, and N be the total number of employees in the company.
Then we have:
W + S - 0.4N = 0.75N   (75% of the employees take a winter vacation)
0.6N - S = 0.2N        (20% take neither a winter nor a summer vacation)
S - W = QN             (we want to find Q, the percent taking a summer vacation but not a winter vacation)
Solving for W and S, we get:
W = 0.35N
S = 0.4N - 0.2N = 0.2N
Substituting these into the third equation, we get:
S - W = QN
0.2N - 0.35N = QN
-0.15N = QN
Q = -0.15/-0.85 = 3/17

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,7,4,"Let's assume there are 100 employees in the company.
According to the problem:
- 75 employees take a winter vacation
- 40 employees take both a winter and a summer vacation
- 20 employees do not take either vacation

Therefore, the number of employees who take at least one of the vacations is:
75 employees who take a winter vacation + (number of employees who take ONLY a summer vacation)
= 75 + X

Also, the number of employees who take at least one of the vacations is:
40 employees who take both vacations + (number of employees who take ONLY a winter vacation) + (number of employees who take ONLY a summer vacation)
= 40 + Y + Z

Since there are 20 employees who take neither vacation, we can write:
Total number of employees = 75 + X = 40 + Y + Z + 20
Simplifying this equation, we get:
X - Y - Z = -15

We want to find the percentage of employees who take ONLY a summer vacation, which is represented by Z, as a percentage of the total number of employees. Let's call this percentage Q.

So we need to find Z as a percentage of 100:
Q% = (Z/100) x 100

We can solve for Z by using the equation we derived earlier:
X - Y - Z = -15
Z = X - Y + 15

Substituting this into the equation for Q%, we get:
Q% = [(X - Y + 15)/100] x 100

We still need to find X and Y. We know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, so:
X + Y + 40 = 75

We also know that 20% of the employees take neither vacation, so:
X + Y = 20

Solving these equations simultaneously, we get:
X = 35 and Y = -15

Substituting these values into the equation for Q%, we get:
Q% = [(35 - (-15) + 15)/100] x 100
Q% = 30/100 x 100
Q% = 30

Therefore, 30% of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,7,5,"Let's assume there are 100 employees in the company. 

So, 75% of 100 employees take a winter vacation, which equals 75 employees. 

40% of 100 employees take both winter and summer vacations, which equals 40 employees.

20% of 100 employees take neither winter nor summer vacations, which equals 20 employees.

Let X% of employees take summer vacations but not winter vacations.

So, the total number of employees who take summer vacations is:
40% (winter and summer vacations) + X% (summer vacations only) = 40 + X

The total number of employees is:
100% (total employees) = 75% (winter vacations) + 40% (winter and summer vacations) + X% (summer vacations only) + 20% (neither winter nor summer vacations)
= 75 + 40 + X + 20
= 135 + X

Since there are only 100 employees, we know that 135+X=100
Therefore, X = -35.

Since X cannot be negative, we can conclude that none of the given choices are correct.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,7,7,"Let's assume there are 100 employees in the company. 75% of them take a winter vacation which is 75 employees. 20% of them take neither a winter nor a summer vacation which is 20 employees. This means 100 - 75 - 20 = 5% of employees take only a summer vacation. 

Now, let's consider the employees who take a winter and summer vacation. We know that 40% of employees take both winter and summer vacations which is 40 employees. We can subtract this from the total number of employees who take summer vacation to get the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation. 

Therefore, Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation = (5% + 40%) - 40% = 5%.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,0,"Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Then, we can create two equations based on the given information: 
1. 20x + 25y = 340 (since the total amount she earned is $3.40 or 340 cents)
2. The number of copper coins should be minimum, which means the total number of coins should be as low as possible. Therefore, we can assume that she only brought copper coins and no brass coins. In this case, y = 0, and the equation becomes: 
20x + 25(0) = 340
20x = 340
x = 17

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 17. 

Action: Answer(""E"")
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,1,"Let's assume she brought x number of copper coins and y number of brass coins. 

We know that the value of each copper coin is $0.20, so the total value of x copper coins is $0.20x. Similarly, the total value of y brass coins is $0.25y.

We also know that the total value of all the coins is $3.40. So, we can write an equation:

$0.20x + $0.25y = $3.40

We need to find the minimum number of copper coins. Since we want to minimize the number of copper coins, let's assume that she brought the maximum number of brass coins possible. In this case, the remaining amount after subtracting the value of brass coins from $3.40 will be the value of copper coins.

Let's assume she brought y brass coins. The value of these brass coins is $0.25y. So, the remaining value (which is the value of copper coins) is:

$3.40 - $0.25y

This value must be a multiple of $0.20 (the value of each copper coin) because she only gets paid in multiples of $0.20. Therefore, we can write:

$3.40 - $0.25y = $0.20n, where n is a positive integer

We can simplify this equation:

$3.40 = $0.20n + $0.25y
$3.40/$0.05 = 4n/0.05 + (5y/0.05)
68 = 20n + 25y

We want to minimize the value of x (number of copper coins), so we need to find the maximum possible value of y (number of brass coins) such that 20n + 25y = 68 has a solution in positive integers.

We can try different values of y starting from the largest possible value (y = 2). If we substitute y = 2 in the equation, we get:

20n + 25(2) = 68
20n = 18
n = 0.9

This is not a positive integer. Therefore, we try the next value of y (y = 1):

20n + 25(1) = 68
20n = 43
n = 2.15

This is not a positive integer either. Therefore, we try the next value of y (y = 0):

20n + 25(0) = 68
20n = 68
n = 3.4

This is not a positive integer either. Therefore, we conclude that it is not possible to get exactly $3.40 with a combination of copper and brass coins.

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,5,"Let's assume the number of copper coins is x and the number of brass coins is y. 

To solve the problem, we need to form two equations. 

The first equation is based on the total value of the coins. We know that the total value of the coins is $3.40. Therefore:

0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40

The second equation is based on the fact that the number of coins must be a whole number. Therefore:

x + y = some whole number

We don't know the exact number of coins, but we know that it must be a whole number. 

To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to assume that the number of brass coins is maximum. In other words, we assume that all the coins she brought except one are brass. This gives us:

0.20x + 0.25(y-1) = 3.40

Simplifying this equation, we get:

0.20x + 0.25y - 0.25 = 3.40
0.20x + 0.25y = 3.65

We can now substitute the first equation into the second equation:

0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40
0.20x + 0.25(y-1) = 3.65

Subtracting the second equation from the first equation, we get:

0.25 = 0.25

This means that our assumption was correct, and the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 1. 

Therefore, the answer is: Answer(""D"")

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,6,"Let's assume that the coin-diver brought 'c' copper coins and 'b' brass coins. 

The total amount she got after one dive is $3.40. We can express this information in an equation: 

0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40 

We want to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought. To do this, we need to find the smallest possible value of 'c' that satisfies the above equation. 

Let's start by trying the smallest value of 'c', which is c=0. 

If she didn't bring any copper coins, then b = 3.40/0.25 = 13.6, which is not a whole number. 

Let's try the next value of 'c', which is c=1. 

0.20(1) + 0.25b = 3.40 

0.25b = 3.20 

b = 12.8 

Since 'b' has to be a whole number, this doesn't work. 

Let's try c=2. 

0.20(2) + 0.25b = 3.40 

0.25b = 3.00 

b = 12 

This works! She brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,7,"To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let's assume that the number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is ""x"" and the number of brass coins is ""y"". Then we can write two equations based on the given information:

- Equation 1: The total amount of money that the coin-diver got is $3.40. So we have:
   20x + 25y = 340   (in cents)
   
- Equation 2: The coin-diver only gets copper coins and brass coins. So we have:
   x + y = total number of coins
   
We want to find the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought. This means we want to minimize the value of ""x"". One way to do this is to eliminate ""y"" from the equations above. We can do this by multiplying Equation 2 by 25 and then subtracting it from Equation 1:

20x + 25y = 340
- 25x - 25y = -25(total number of coins)

-5x = 340 - 25(total number of coins)
x = (25(total number of coins) - 68)

Now we can see that ""x"" is minimized when ""(total number of coins)"" is minimized. Since we want a positive integer value for ""x"", we need to choose the smallest possible value for ""(total number of coins)"" that makes ""x"" an integer. The only option that works is 4 (if the total number of coins is less than 4, then ""x"" will not be an integer). So we have:

x = 25(4) - 68 = 32

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is 32.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,8,8,"First, let's assume that the diver only found copper coins. In this case, she would have found 17 copper coins (340/20=17). However, since she found both copper and brass coins, the total number of coins she found must be greater than 17. 

Let's assume that she found x brass coins. In this case, the total value of brass coins is 25x cents. The total value of copper coins is (340 - 25x) cents. 

Since each copper coin is worth 20 cents, the number of copper coins can be calculated as (340 - 25x)/20. This must be a whole number, so 340 - 25x must be a multiple of 20. 

The only multiple of 20 between 0 and 340 that leaves a remainder of 0 or 5 when divided by 25 is 320. Therefore, 340 - 25x = 320, which gives x = 8. 

So the diver found 8 brass coins and (340 - 25*8)/20 = 2 copper coins.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,69,1,"Out of the $39$ people who recalled $1$ or more dream, $68-11=57$ are from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least $1$ dream belongs to Group Y is $\frac{57}{39+57}=\frac{57}{96}=\frac{19}{32}$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}$.
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,69,2,"We want to find the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream. We can use the formula: probability = (number of desired outcomes) / (total number of outcomes). 

Out of the 39 people who recalled at least one dream, 68 - 11 = 57 people are from Group Y. So, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is:

probability = (number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream) / (total number of people who recalled at least one dream)
probability = 57 / 39
probability = 1.46

However, the probability cannot be greater than 1. This is because the numerator (57) is greater than the denominator (39). 

Therefore, we made an error in our calculation. We need to use the formula: probability = (number of desired outcomes) / (total number of outcomes). 

Out of the 125 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 people are from Group Y. So, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is:

probability = (number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream) / (total number of people who recalled at least one dream)
probability = 68 / 125

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,69,3,"The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{39+125}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. The probability that a person who belongs to Group Y recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{11+68}{100}=\frac{79}{100}$. Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{\text{number of people who belong to both Group Y and the ""recalled at least 1 dream"" group}}{\text{number of people who belong to the ""recalled at least 1 dream"" group}}=\frac{68}{164}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$$
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.7,69,4,"The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $1 - \frac{36}{200} = \frac{8}{25}$. 

The probability that a person was in Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{200}$. 

Therefore, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is: 

$$\frac{\text{Probability of both events happening}}{\text{Probability of one event happening}} = \frac{\frac{68}{200}}{\frac{8}{25}} = \frac{425}{800} = \frac{17}{32}$$

$$\frac{57}{39}=\frac{19}{13}$$

This is not one of the answer choices, but we can simplify it further by dividing numerator and denominator by 19 to get:

$$\frac{19}{13}=\frac{1}{\frac{13}{19}}\approx\frac{1}{1.58}$$

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

$$\frac{1}{1.58}\approx0.63$$

So the closest answer choice is (B): $\frac{79}{100}$.

There are 5 vowels that we can choose. 

We can choose the first letter among the 20 consonants, and we have 20 choices.

We cannot select the same letter as the first letter for the third letter, so we have 19 choices left.

Thus, we have a total of 5 x 20 x 19 choices if we ignore the condition that the middle letter must be a vowel.

Out of these choices, we have 5 x 20 options where the first and the third letter are the same. 

So, the total number of codes that can be formed with the given conditions is:

5 x 20 x 19 - 5 x 20

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,5,1,"Let ""x"" be the total deer population in the forest. 

Out of the 500 deer caught during 2002, only 20 had tags from 2001. This means the estimated percentage of tagged deer in the forest during 2002 is 20/500 = 0.04.

According to the problem, the percentage of the tagged deer population in 2002 is representative of the percentage of the total deer population with tags. This means:

(number of tagged deer in 2002) / x = 0.04

We know that 300 deer were tagged in 2001, so the number of tagged deer in 2002 would be 300 (since it is assumed there is no change in population). Thus:

300 / x = 0.04

Solving for x, we have:

x = 7500

Therefore, the total deer population in the forest is 7500.

We are given that the total percentage of employees who take winter vacation is 75%, which means that x+z+w+u=75. We are also given that 40% take both winter and summer vacations, which means that z+w=40. Lastly, we are given that 20% take neither winter nor summer vacations, which means that the remaining percentage of employees take summer vacation only or both, so y+w+v=100-20=80.

To find the percentage of employees who take summer vacation only (y), we need to subtract the percentage of employees who take both (z+w) and the percentage of employees who take neither (20%) from the percentage of employees who take summer vacation or both (y+w+v):
```
y = (y+w+v) - (z+w) - 20
  = 80 - 40 - 20

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,7,1,"Let W, S and N denote the number of employees taking winter vacation, summer vacation and none respectively. 
Given, 
W + N = 25 (as 75% = 100% - 25%) 
W + S - 0.4W = 40   => W = 50 - 2S   .......... (1)
N = 20 

Now,  S-W will give the required number of employees who take summer vacation but not winter vacation. 

Plugging the value of W and N in the above expression gives us:
S-W = S- (50 - 2S) = 3S - 50 

To find S-W as a percent of total employees, we can divide S-W by total employees (100) and multiply by 100. 

S-W = 3S - 50 
S-W = 3(25+N) - 50      (as W+N = 20)
S-W = 3(25 + 20) - 50 = 85

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,7,2,"Let's say there are 100 employees in the company. If 75% are taking a winter vacation, then 25 employees (25% of 100) are not taking a winter vacation, out of which 20% are taking neither a winter nor a summer vacation, meaning 5 employees (5% of 100) are taking only a summer vacation. 

Out of the 75 employees taking a winter vacation, 40% are taking both a winter and a summer vacation, which means 30 employees (40% of 75) are taking both vacations. Therefore, the remaining employees who are taking a summer vacation are 100% - 40% = 60% of the 75 winter vacationers, which is 45 employees (60% of 75). 

Thus, the total number of employees taking a summer vacation is 45 + 5 = 50. 

Q percent of the employees take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, which can be calculated as:

- 75 take a winter vacation
- 40 take a winter and a summer vacation
- 20 take neither a winter nor a summer vacation

We can use the formula: 

    n(A or B) = n(A) + n(B) - n(A and B)

Let A be the set of employees who take a winter vacation and let B be the set of employees who take a summer vacation. Then:

- n(A) = 75 (those who take a winter vacation)

To calculate the percentage of employees that take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the employees who take both vacations from the employees who take only a summer vacation. 

- Employees who take only a winter vacation = 75 - 40 = 35

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,8,0,"We can use algebra to solve the problem. Let's assume that the number of copper coins is ""x"" and the number of brass coins is ""y"". Then we can write two equations based on the given information:

Equation 1: 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents)
Equation 2: x + y = total number of coins

We want to find the minimum number of copper coins, so we want to minimize ""x"". We can use Equation 2 to express ""y"" in terms of ""x"":

y = (total number of coins) - x

Substituting this into Equation 1, we get:

20x + 25((total number of coins) - x) = 340

Simplifying and solving for ""x"", we get:

x = (5/4)(total number of coins) - 17

The number of coins has to be a positive integer, so let's try different values of ""total number of coins"" until we get a whole number for ""x"":

If total number of coins = 5, then x = (5/4)(5) - 17 = -9.75 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 6, then x = (5/4)(6) - 17 = -7.5 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 7, then x = (5/4)(7) - 17 = -5.25 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 8, then x = (5/4)(8) - 17 = -3 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 9, then x = (5/4)(9) - 17 = -0.75 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 10, then x = (5/4)(10) - 17 = 1.5 (not a positive integer)
If total number of coins = 11, then x = (5/4)(11) - 17 = 3.75 (not a positive integer)

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,8,1,"Action: Answer(""A"")  
Solution: 

Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
From the given information, we can set up two equations:

The total value of copper coins = 20 * x cents
The total value of brass coins = 25 * y cents

The total amount earned after one dive = $3.40 = 340 cents
So, we can write another equation as:

Total value of all coins = 20x + 25y = 340 cents

We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.

Let's start by trying some values of x and y:

- If x = 0, then y = 13.6, which is not possible as the number of coins must be a whole number.
- If x = 1, then y = 12, which works as the total value of coins is 20 * 1 + 25 * 12 = 340 cents.
- If x = 2, then y = 10.4, which is not possible as the number of coins must be a whole number.
- If x = 3, then y = 8.8, which is not possible as the number of coins must be a whole number.
- If x = 4, then y = 7.2, which is not possible as the number of coins must be a whole number.
- If x >= 5, then the total value of copper coins would be at least 100 cents, which means the total value of brass coins would be at most 240 cents, and we can't make up the remaining 100 cents with a combination of brass coins.

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 1, which is option A.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,8,3,"Action: Answer(""B"") 

Explanation: 
Let's say she brought x copper coins from the bottom of the river.
Then, the number of brass coins she brought will be (8-x).
So, the total amount she earned from x copper coins = 20x cents
The total amount she earned from (8-x) brass coins = 25(8-x) cents
According to the problem, the total amount she earned from both types of coins is $3.40 or 340 cents.

So, we can write an equation as follows:
20x + 25(8-x) = 340

Simplifying this equation we get:
20x + 200 - 25x = 340
-5x = -140
x = 28

So, she brought 28 copper coins. But we need to select the minimum number of copper coins she brought, which is (8 - x) or (8 - 28) = -20. Negative value is not possible in this case. So, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 8 - (8 - x) = x - 0 = 28 - 0 = 28. Therefore, the answer is 3 (Option B).
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,8,4,"Action: Answer(""A"") 

Let's assume the number of copper coins she brought is x. 

So, for each copper coin, the coin-diver gets 20 cents. That means, 20x cents she earned from copper coins. 

Similarly, she gets 25 cents for each brass coin. So, the number of brass coins she brought = (total amount earned - total amount earned from copper coins) / 25. 

Given, after one dive, she got $3.40 = 340 cents. 

Therefore, total amount earned from brass coins = 340 - 20x. 

And, the total number of brass coins = (340 - 20x) / 25. 

We know that the total number of coins = number of copper coins + number of brass coins. 

Total number of coins = x + (340 - 20x) / 25. 

We need to find the minimum value of x, so we'll assume that the remaining coins are brass coins. 

That means, the (340 - 20x) / 25 is a whole number. Therefore, 340 - 20x is divisible by 25. 

The multiples of 25 that are less than or equal to 340 are 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 225, 250, 275, 300, and 325. 

Out of these multiples of 25, only 100 satisfies our criteria. 

Therefore, 340 - 20x = 100. 

Solving for x, we get x = 12/5 or x = 2.4. 

Since the number of copper coins must be a whole number, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 4.
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,8,5,"Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins. Then, using the given information, we can set up the following equation:

0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40

To solve for x, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins. We can rearrange the equation above to solve for x:

0.20x = 3.40 - 0.25y
x = (3.40 - 0.25y)/0.20

The number of copper coins (x) must be a whole number, so we can try plugging in different values of y until we get a whole number for x. However, we can also notice that the units digit of 0.25y alternates between 5 and 0 as y increases by 1. Therefore, the units digit of (3.40 - 0.25y) must also alternate between 0 and 5. We can quickly see that when y = 2, we get:

3.40 - 0.25y = 3.40 - 0.25(2) = 3.40 - 0.50 = 2.90

Since 2.90 is not divisible by 0.20, we can try the next value of y, which is y = 3:

3.40 - 0.25y = 3.40 - 0.25(3) = 3.40 - 0.75 = 2.65

Now, we can check if 2.65 is divisible by 0.20:

x = (3.40 - 0.25y)/0.20 = (3.40 - 0.25(3))/0.20 = 2

Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is 2.

Explanation: Let's assume that the number of copper coins to be x, and the number of the brass coins to be y. Then, we can form two equations from the given information:
1. 0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40 (the total amount obtained after the dive)
2. x + y = the total number of coins obtained in the dive

To minimize the number of copper coins, we need to maximize the number of brass coins. The maximum possible value of y can be 13, which will give us 13 brass coins and 2 copper coins, and satisfy both equations. Any further increase in y will cause the total amount obtained to exceed $3.40. Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that the diver must have brought is 2.

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,10,4,"To find out the length of the ribbon now, we need to find the reduced length first by dividing the original length by the ratio, then multiply it by the smaller part of the ratio. 

30 / (5+3) = 3.75 is the reduced length

Now, by multiplying the reduced length with the smaller part of the ratio, we can find its length now.

3.75 x 3 = 11.25

Therefore, the length of the ribbon now is 11.25 cm.

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,69,0,"Out of the total 39 people who recalled dreams ranging from 1-4, Group X accounted for 28, so Group Y must have accounted for 11. Similarly, out of the total 125 people who recalled at least 5 dreams, Group X accounted for 57, so Group Y must have accounted for 68. Since we are interested in finding the probability that the person chosen at random is from Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream, we should only consider the people who fall into the category of ""1 to 4"" dreams and ""5 or more"" dreams. 

Out of the total 100+100=200 people, 36 recalled no dreams. So, there are 200-36=164 people who recalled at least 1 dream. Out of these 164 people, 11 are from Group Y and 68 are from Group Y. So, the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y is:

\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled at least one dream and belonged to Group Y}}{\text{Number of people who recalled at least one dream}} &= \frac{11+68}{164} \\
&= \frac{79}{164}

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,69,1,"The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. Since Group Y consists of 100 people, the number of people from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}=\frac{79}{164}$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,69,2,"The probability that a person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is:

$$\frac{\text{Number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}$$

We know that the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is:

$$39 + 125 = 164$$

We also know that the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is:

$$11 + 68 = 79$$

Therefore, the probability that a person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Hence, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Therefore, the answer is (C).
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,69,3,"We want to calculate the probability that the person chosen is in Group Y given that the person recalled at least one dream. Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(Group Y|at least 1 dream) = $\frac{P(at\ least\ 1\ dream|Group\ Y)P(Group\ Y)}{P(at\ least\ 1\ dream)}$

We can calculate each term:

- $P(at\ least\ 1\ dream|Group\ Y)$: This is the proportion of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream, which is $\frac{68}{100}$.
- $P(Group\ Y)$: This is the proportion of people in the sample who belong to Group Y, which is $\frac{100}{200}$ or $\frac{1}{2}$.
- $P(at\ least\ 1\ dream)$: This is the proportion of people in the sample who recalled at least one dream, which is $\frac{164}{200}$.

Substituting these values, we get:

P(Group Y|at least 1 dream) = $\frac{\frac{68}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{164}{200}}$ = $\frac{68}{100}\cdot\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{200}{164}$ = $\frac{17}{41}$

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,0.9,69,6,"We want to find the probability that a randomly chosen person from those who recalled at least one dream is from Group Y. Letâ€™s use the following notation:

- $X_0$: number of people in Group X who did not recall any dreams
- $X_1$: number of people in Group X who recalled 1 to 4 dreams
- $X_5$: number of people in Group X who recalled 5 or more dreams
- $Y_0$: number of people in Group Y who did not recall any dreams

- $Y_5$: number of people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams
- $T_1$: number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams

We know that there are 39 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, and 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, for a total of 164 people who recalled at least one dream. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen person from those who recalled at least one dream is from Group Y is:

Since the problem asks for the probability that the person is from Group Y, we need to multiply the previous result by the proportion of people who recalled at least 1 dream, then we get: $$\frac{68}{107} \cdot \frac{200-36}{200}= \frac{68}{107} \cdot \frac{164}{200}=\frac{79}{164}$$

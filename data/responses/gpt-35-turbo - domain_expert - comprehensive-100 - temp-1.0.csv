First, we need to count how many different vowels we have to choose from: 5. 

Second, we need to count how many different pairs of consonants we have to choose from for the first and third letter. There are 20 choices for the first letter, but since the third letter cannot be the same as the first, there are 19 choices for the third letter.

Third, we need to multiply the number of choices together: 5 choices for the middle letter, and 20*19 choices for the first and third letters, giving us a total of 5*20*19 = 1,900 possible 3-letter codes.

Explanation: Let's assume that the coin-diver brought 'c' copper coins and 'b' brass coins. From the given information, we know that:
c + b = total number of coins
0.20c + 0.25b = 3.40
We need to find the minimum value of 'c' that satisfies these equations. We can solve the equations above by multiplying the first equation by 20 and subtracting it from the second equation to eliminate 'c':
0.25b - 0.20c = 3.40 - 20c
0.05b = 3.40 - 20c - 20c
0.05b = 3.40 - 40c
5b = 340 - 400c
b = 68 - 80c
Since 'b' and 'c' are both integers, we know that 'b' must be a multiple of 5. The only multiple of 5 in the range of 'b' = {0, 5, ..., 68} that satisfies the equation above is b = 65 (when c = 1 and b = 65, we get $0.20(1) + $0.25(65) = $3.40). Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 1 (because if she brought 0 copper coins, she would need to bring 13 brass coins, which is not possible given the total number of coins).

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,8,5,"Action: Answer(""A"") 

Let's suppose she brought x copper coins and y brass coins.

So, according to the given information:
- She will get ""20 cents"" for each copper coin, so the total earnings from copper coins will be 20x cents.
- She will get ""25 cents"" for each brass coin, so the total earnings from brass coins will be 25y cents.
- She got ""$3.40"" in total, so the total earnings will be 340 cents.

Now, we need to find the value of x (minimum number of copper coins). So, we can create an equation using the above information, as follows:
20x + 25y = 340

We know that the number of coins cannot be negative, so the minimum values of x and y can be 0. Let's try to solve the equation by assuming y=0 and y=1.

If y=0, then the equation becomes:
20x + 25(0) = 340
20x = 340
x = 17

If y=1, then the equation becomes:
20x + 25(1) = 340
20x = 315
x = 15.75

We want to have a whole number as the value of x, so we can't consider the value obtained for y=1. Hence, the minimum number of copper coins she brought must be 4 (since 20*4=80).
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,8,6,"Let's assume the number of copper coins be ""C"" and the number of brass coins be ""B"".
From the question, we can set up the following two equations:
1. 20C + 25B = 340   (3.40 dollars can also be written as 340 cents)      
2. 1C + 1B = Total number of coins retrieved in one dive 
We need to find the minimum value of C that satisfies both equations.
Now, we can solve for B in terms of C from equation 2:
B = Total number of coins retrieved in one dive  - C
Substituting it in equation 1, we get:
20C + 25(Total number of coins retrieved in one dive - C) = 340
Simplifying, we get:
5C = 340 - 25(Total number of coins retrieved in one dive)
5C = 15 + 25(3 - Total number of coins retrieved in one dive)   (Since 1C + 1B = Total number of coins retrieved in one dive  => B = Total number of coins retrieved in one dive - C => 1B = Total number of coins retrieved in one dive - C => 25B = 25(Total number of coins retrieved in one dive - C))
C = 3 - Total number of coins retrieved in one dive
We can see that C can never be more than 3 (if she retrieved all brass coins, then C = 0) and also cannot be negative. So, we can try putting values for the total number of coins retrieved in one dive and checking which one will give us an integer value for C.
If she retrieved all 3 brass coins (Total number of coins retrieved in one dive = 3), then C = 0 (not an integer value). 
If she retrieved 2 brass coins (Total number of coins retrieved in one dive = 2), then C = (3 - 2) = 1. So, this satisfies the given conditions.
Putting Total number of coins retrieved in one dive = 2 in equation 1, we get:
20(1) + 25(2) = 70
So, the answer is:
Action: Answer(""C"")
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,8,7,"Let's assume that the number of copper coins that the coin-diver brought is ""C"" and the number of brass coins she brought is ""B"". The total earnings is $3.40 and the earning from each copper coin is 20 cents or $0.20 while the earning from each brass coin is 25 cents or $0.25. So, we can form two equations based on the total earnings and the number of coins brought as follows:

0.20C + 0.25B = 3.40   (Equation 1) 
C + B = Total number of coins   (Equation 2)

To minimize the number of copper coins, we need to assume that all the remaining coins are brass coins. Therefore, we need to assume that ""B"" is as large as possible. So, let's assume that the coin-diver was not able to bring any copper coin. This means that all the coins brought by the coin-diver are brass coins, which means that B = Total number of coins. By substituting this into Equation 1 we get:

0.20C + 0.25(Total number of coins) = 3.40 

Now, let's check which of the choices given would make the left-hand side equal to $3.40:

A) 0.20(4) + 0.25(4) = $1.80
B) 0.20(3) + 0.25(3) = $1.35
C) 0.20(2) + 0.25(2) = $0.90
D) 0.20(1) + 0.25(1) = $0.45
E) 0.20(0) + 0.25(0) = $0

We see that no one of the above choices equals to $3.40, which means that our assumption was wrong and the coin-diver needs to bring at least one copper coin. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer(""D"")  (because if she brings one copper coin, she will have 2.95 left which is 11 brass coins, totaling 12 coins in all. So she brought one copper coin and 11 brass coins)

"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,8,9,"Let's assume that she picks x copper coins & y brass coins. 
Since she got $3.40 in total, we can form the following equation:
0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40
Multiplying the equation by 100, we get:
20x + 25y = 340
Dividing the equation by 5, we get:
4x + 5y = 68
We know that the minimum number of copper coins will give us the maximum value of brass coins.
Hence, 4 copper coins will give 68 - (4x) = 68 - 16 = 52, which is the highest possible value for brass coins.
5y = 52 => y = 10.4
Since x and y are integers, x can take the value of 3. (For x = 2, y is not an integer, while for x = 4, the value of y is less than 0, which is not possible).
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 3.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,25,2,"We can use the given constraints to eliminate certain options:
- Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. Therefore, we cannot have Frost assigned without Heideck.
- If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, we cannot have Gonzalez and Lai both assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
- If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, if Knutson is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then neither Heideck nor Mays can be assigned to it.

gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,69,7,"We want to find the probability that a person who recalled at least one dream belonged to group Y. We can set up a proportion: $$\frac{\text{number of people in group Y who recalled at least one dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least one dream}}=\frac{68}{39+125}=\frac{68}{164}.$$ So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}$.
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,69,8,"We want to find $P(\text{Group Y}\,|\,\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream})$. Using Bayes Theorem, we can write:

$$P(\text{Group Y}\,|\,\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream})=\frac{P(\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream}\,|\,\text{Group Y})\cdot P(\text{Group Y})}{P(\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream})}$$

We can find each of these probabilities as follows:

- $P(\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream}\,|\,\text{Group Y})=\frac{11+68}{100}=0.79$
- $P(\text{Group Y})=\frac{100}{200}=0.5$
- $P(\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream})=\frac{39+125}{200}=0.82$

Plugging these into Bayes Theorem above, we get:

$$P(\text{Group Y}\,|\,\text{Recalled at least 1 Dream})=\frac{0.79\cdot 0.5}{0.82}\approx 0.4829$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\,\frac{79}{164}}$.
"
gpt-35-turbo,domain_expert,comprehensive-100,1.0,69,9,"The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$, of which $68$ belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that the person chosen at random belonged to Group Y is given by:

$$\text{Probability}=\frac{\text{Number of people who recalled }1\text{ or more dreams in Y}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled }1\text{ or more dreams}}=\frac{68}{164}$$

Therefore the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.

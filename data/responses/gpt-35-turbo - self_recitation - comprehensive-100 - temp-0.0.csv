  1. The semi-perimeter of a room is half the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
  2. The cost of papering the walls of a room is equal to the perimeter of the room multiplied by the cost per meter of the paper.
  3. The area of a rectangle is equal to its length multiplied by its width.
  
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y. Then, the length of the room is 5y - 2x and the width of the room is y. 

The perimeter of the room is 2(5y - 2x) + 2y = 10y - 4x + 2y = 12y - 4x. 

The cost of papering the walls is (12y - 4x)(2/100) = (3y - x)(1/25) = 260. 

Also, the area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m. The area of the walls is (5y - 2x)(2x) = 10xy - 4x^2. Therefore, 10xy - 4x^2 - 15 = area of the walls to be papered. 

Solving the two equations simultaneously, we get x = 0.3 and y = 1.2. Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 0.6 * 2 = 1.2m.

- 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
- 40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
- 20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
- We want to find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.

To find the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation, we need to subtract the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take only a summer vacation.

The number of employees who take only a summer vacation can be found by subtracting the number of employees who take both vacations from the number of employees who take a summer vacation:
Summer vacation only = Total summer vacation - Both vacations
Summer vacation only = (100-Q)% - 40%

We also know that 75% of the employees take a winter vacation, and 40% take both vacations. This means that the percentage of employees who take a summer vacation is:
80% - 75% + 40% = 45%

  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the fifth week, since O and S cannot perform continuously. Therefore, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth, or seventh week. 
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for either the first, second, third, or fourth week. 
  Since F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K must be arranged before J and S, then F and J must be scheduled for either the second and third weeks or the third and fourth weeks.

  The argument presents a psychological theory that to be happy, one must maintain an intimate relationship with another.
  The argument also presents the fact that the greatest philosophers in the world spent most of their lives in isolation, and had no intimate relationships.
  The conclusion is that the psychological theory must be wrong.
  
Analysis:
  The argument presents two premises and a conclusion. The conclusion is that the psychological theory must be wrong. To reach this conclusion, the argument assumes that the fact that the greatest philosophers in the world spent most of their lives in isolation, and had no intimate relationships, is enough to disprove the psychological theory. Therefore, the assumption that must be made is that the greatest philosophers in the world are a representative sample of the population, and that their experience is enough to disprove the psychological theory.

Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall cannot all work in Zone 3. This means that one of them must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2. However, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, the remaining sales representative, Quinn, cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.

  B: This principle is not relevant to the argument. It talks about the severity of penalties in general, but it does not address the issue of whether the penalty for this type of pollution is too severe.

  The columnist believes that the legislator's proposal to use the extra money from water bills to build new roads instead of building a dam is unacceptable.
  A: This principle is related to transparency and accountability, but it does not directly address the issue of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not.
  B: This principle suggests that money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. However, it does not directly address the issue of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not.
  C: This principle suggests that an additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. However, it does not directly address the issue of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not.
  D: This principle suggests that an additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature. However, it does not directly address the issue of whether the legislator's proposal is acceptable or not.

  The physician argues that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain based on an experiment where 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain.
  A: This statement suggests that the improvement in the first group could be due to a placebo effect, rather than the magnets themselves.
  B: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.
  C: This statement is irrelevant to the argument about the effectiveness of magnetic fields in relieving back pain.

  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) to produce brain scans that depict the differential rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain. The method subtracts a baseline measurement in the control condition from a second measurement taken while the subject is performing some cognitive task. The resulting image is interpreted as a map of the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The author argues that the subtractive method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions and that it creates an illusion of neat functional localization that supports the modular theory of mind. However, the author also questions the validity of the modular theory of mind and suggests that mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind. It explains that the modular theory of mind may not be valid and that the subtractive method used in brain scans can produce a false impression of neat functional localization.
A: The passage argues against the validity of the modular theory of mind and suggests that mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules. It does not support the idea that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. 
B: The passage does not discuss whether regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero. 
C: The passage explains that the FMRI is usually interpreted as a map of the rate of oxygen use in different parts of the brain, which stands as a measure of metabolic activity. It also explains that the subtractive method produces striking images of the brain at work. Therefore, this statement is most strongly supported by the passage.

  The passage describes three different musical styles through which Schoenberg's music evolved.
  The first style is late-Romantic manner, music charged with shifting chromatic harmonies.
  The second style is characterized by unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis.
  The third style is characterized by the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it.
  The author describes Schoenberg's music as essential because he precisely delineated recognizable and sometimes disquieting emotional states that music had not recorded before.

  The researchers found that young woodpecker finches that never had the opportunity to watch tool use develop the ability to use tools with similar aptitude and reached distinct developmental steps that marked the appearance of new tool-oriented behavior at a similar age as their siblings that were given the chance to observe tool use in adult woodpecker finches. The researchers concluded that, in contrast to chimpanzees, social learning is not necessary for the acquisition of this behavior in woodpecker finches. Instead, the developmental process seems to be strongly dependent on genetically fixed components. However, the researchers also found that non-social, individual learning does play an important role during the ontogeny of tool use in serving to improve the efficiency of this behavior.

Action: Answer(""-4"")  
To find $f(-1)$, we substitute $-1$ for $x$ in the expression $f(x)=x-3$ to get $f(-1)=-1-3=-4$. Therefore, the answer is (A) -5.

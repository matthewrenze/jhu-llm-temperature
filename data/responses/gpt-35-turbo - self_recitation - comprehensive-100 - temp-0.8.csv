  1. Semi-perimeter of a room = (perimeter of the room) / 2.
  2. The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5.
  3. Cost of papering the walls of a room = Cost per unit area x Total area to be papered.
  4. Total area to be papered = (perimeter of the room) x (height of the room)
  5. Doors and windows are to be exempted from the total area to be papered.

Calculation:
Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5x. Then, the perimeter of the room = 2 x semi-perimeter = 10x.

We need to find the height of the room.
Let's first find the perimeter of the room.

As per the question, 50 cm wide paper is used and the cost of papering the walls is Rs. 260. Therefore, we can say that the total length of the walls to be papered = 130 m (260 / 2).

Now, the area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
Therefore, the total area of the four walls = Total area to be papered + Area of doors and windows = (130 x height of the room) + 15.

As we know, the semi-perimeter of the room is 5x.
So, the perimeter of the room = 2 x semi-perimeter = 10x.
Therefore, the height of the room can be found using the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter, which is given as 2:5.

So, we can write the equation as:
2x / 5x = height of the room / (perimeter of the room / 2)
Simplifying this equation, we get:
height of the room = (2/5) x (perimeter of the room / 2x)

Substituting the values, we get:
height of the room = (2/5) x (10x / 2x) = 2m.

Total area of the four walls = (130 x 2) + 15 = 275 sq.m
Cost of papering one sq.m of the wall = 2 / 100 = Rs.0.02
Cost of papering the four walls = Cost per sq.m x Total area of the four walls = 0.02 x 275 = Rs. 5.50

Now, we can use the fact that the cost of papering the four walls is Rs. 260.
So, we can write the equation as:
Rs. 5.50 x Required area to be papered = Rs. 260
Solving this equation, we get:
Required area to be papered = (260 / 5.5) = 47.27 sq.m

As we know, the total area of the four walls = 275 sq.m
Therefore, the area of doors and windows = 275 - 47.27 = 227.73 sq.m

Now, we can find the height of the room.
We know that the perimeter of the room is 10x and the height of the room is 2m.
So, the area of the four walls = (10x x 2) = 20x sq.m

We need to find the length of each wall, which can be found using the formula:
Length of each wall = (perimeter of the room / 4) x height of the room

Substituting the values, we get:
Length of each wall = (10x / 4) x 2 = 5x

Therefore, the total area of the four walls = Length of each wall x Height of the room x 4
20x = (5x x height of the room x 4)
Height of the room = 20x / (5x x 4) = 1m

We got the height of the room as 1m.
So, we made some mistake in our calculation.

  Semi-perimeter = (length + breadth + height)/2
  Wallpaper needed = (Total area of the walls - Area of the doors and windows)
  Total area of the walls = 2 x height x (length + breadth)
  Cost of wallpaper = length x (height + 0.5) x cost per meter
  
Solution:
Let the height of the room be 2x and semi-perimeter be 5y.
Therefore, length + breadth = 5y - 2x
And, length x breadth = 2x(5y - 2x) = 10xy - 4x^2
Total area of the walls = 2 x height x (length + breadth) = 2(2x)(5y - 2x) = 20xy - 8x^2
Area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m
Therefore, wallpaper needed = (20xy - 8x^2 - 15)
Cost of wallpaper = length x (height + 0.5) x cost per meter
Substituting the given values, we get, 260 = (5y - 2x) x (2x + 0.5) x 2
Solving this equation, we get, y = 8 and x = 2

  3. The area of the doors and windows needs to be subtracted from the total area of the walls.
  4. The height of the room is in a ratio of 2:5 to its semi-perimeter.
Action: 
Let the height of the room be 2x and the semi-perimeter be 5y.
So, the other two sides of the room are y and 2y.
The cost of pasting a wallpaper for a wall of length l is 2/l.
The cost of pasting wallpaper for the entire room is 2(2x+3y)/0.5 + 2(3y)/0.5 = 4(2x+3y) + 6y = 8x + 18y.
Now, 8x + 18y = 260 + 15*(2/0.5)
8x + 18y = 290
4x + 9y = 145
Also, 2x/5y = 2/5
2x = 2y/5
x = y/5
Substituting this value in 4x+9y = 145, we get 4(y/5) + 9y = 145

  Semi-perimeter = (Perimeter of room) / 2
  Cost of papering the walls = (Length of paper used) * (Cost per unit length)
  Area of the doors and windows = 15 sq.m
  Height to semi-perimeter ratio = 2:5
  Height to width ratio can be found from the height to semi-perimeter ratio using the formula: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a/b = 2/5 and c is the hypotenuse. 
  
Action: 
Using the height to semi-perimeter ratio, let's assume the height to be 2x and the semi-perimeter to be 5x. Then the width is (5x - 2x) / 2 = 1.5x. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we get:

  (2x)^2 + (1.5x)^2 = c^2
  4x^2 + 2.25x^2 = c^2
  6.25x^2 = c^2
  c = 2.5x
  
So, the dimensions of the room are 2x x 1.5x x 2.5x.

The area of the walls is: 2 (2x * 1.5x) + 2 (2x * 2.5x) = 15x^2
The length of paper used is: (Area of walls) / (width of paper) = (15x^2) / 0.5 = 30x^2 meters.
The cost of papering the walls is: 30x^2 * 2 = 60x^2 Rs.
Area of doors and windows = 15 sq.m
Area of 4 walls = (2x*1.5x)*2 + (2x*2.5x)*2 = 15x^2
Area of walls to be papered = Area of 4 walls - Area of doors and windows = 15x^2 - 15 = 15(x^2-1) sq.m.
Area of walls to be papered = Length of paper used * height of room = 30x^2 * 2x = 60x^3 sq.m.
So, 60x^3 = 15(x^2-1) * 0.5
Solving for x, we get x = 0.4
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 0.8 meters.

 1. Semi-perimeter = (perimeter of the room)/2
 2. To paper the walls of the room, we need to find the area of the room's walls, which is equal to the difference between the total area of the walls and the area of windows and doors
 3. The cost of papering the walls is equal to the cost of paper per meter multiplied by the length of paper required to cover the wall
 4. Height to semi-perimeter ratio is given as 2:5.
 
Action: 
First, we need to find the height of the room using the height to semi-perimeter ratio. Let's assume the height of the room is 2x.
Then, the width of the room is 5x. The length of the room is 2(2x + 5x) = 14x.
Therefore, the area of the room is 2x * 14x = 28x^2.
Let's assume the area of doors and windows is y.
Then, the area of the walls is 28x^2 - y.
We know that the area of the walls is 50 cm wide.
Converting it into meters, we get 0.5 m.
Then, the length of paper required to cover the wall is (28x^2 - y) / 0.5.
The cost of the paper is 2 Rs. per meter.
Therefore, 2 * (28x^2 - y)/0.5 = 260.
Simplifying the equation, we get (28x^2 - y) = 260*0.5 = 130.
Also, the area of doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m.
Therefore, y = 15.
Substituting the value of y in the equation, we get 28x^2 -15 = 130.
Solving the equation, we get x = 1.5.
Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 3 meters.

  1. Semi-perimeter of a room is the sum of all its sides divided by 2. 
  2. The ratio of height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. 
  3. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50 cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows.

Let's denote the height of the room as 2x and the semi-perimeter as 5x. 

Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 50 cm = 5x/2 - 0.5m
And, the width of the room is 5x/2 - 50 cm = 5x/2 - 0.5m

The total cost of papering the walls = cost of papering the four walls of the room - cost of papering the doors and windows
= 2x(5x/2 - 0.5m)(2) + 2x(5x/2 - 0.5m)(2) - 15
= 4x(5x/2 - 0.5m) - 15
= 10x^2 - 2x - 15

10x^2 - 2x - 15 = 260/2
10x^2 - 2x - 145 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get x = 3.9 or x = -3.5

Since the height of the room cannot be negative, x must be 3.9

Therefore, the height of the room = 2x = 2(3.9) = 7.8m

Knowledge: 
  1. The semi-perimeter of a room is half the sum of the length and width of the room.
  2. The cost of wallpapering a wall is the product of the length of the wall and the cost per unit length of the wallpaper.
  3. The total area of the four walls of the room is the product of the height and the semi-perimeter of the room.
  4. The area of the doors and windows should be subtracted from the total area of the four walls to get the actual area of the walls to be papered.
  5. The ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is given as 2:5.

Let h be the height of the room, and let s be the semi-perimeter of the room. Then we can write:

h/s = 2/5  (given)

Multiplying both sides by s, we get:

h = (2/5)s

Let L and W be the length and width of the room, respectively. Then we have:

s = (L+W)/2

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

2s = L + W

Substituting (2/5)s for h, we get:

2s = L + W
h = (2/5)s
h = (2/5)(L+W)/2
h = (1/5)(L+W)

The area of the four walls of the room is given by:

2h(L+W)

The area of the doors and windows is given as 15 sq.m. Therefore, the actual area of the walls to be papered is:

2h(L+W) - 15

We are given that it costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the total length of the paper required is:

(2h(L+W) - 15)/0.5

The cost of the paper is the product of the length of the paper and the cost per unit length, which is Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, we have:

260 = (2h(L+W) - 15)/0.5 * 2

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2h(L+W) - 15 = 260/2 = 130

2h(L+W) = 145

Substituting (1/5)(L+W) for h, we get:

2(1/5)(L+W)(L+W) = 145

(L+W)(L+W) = 725

(L+W)^2 = 725

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

L+W = sqrt(725)

Substituting into the equation 2s = L + W, we get:

2s = sqrt(725)

s = sqrt(725)/2

Substituting into the equation h/s = 2/5, we get:

h = (2/5) * (sqrt(725)/2)

h = sqrt(725)/5

h ≈ 3.9m

Therefore, the height of the room is approximately 3.9m.

  - We are told that the percentage of deer in the 500 deer sample that had tags from the previous year is representative of the percentage of the total deer population with tags.

Let's start by finding the percentage of deer in the 500 deer sample that had tags from the previous year:
Percentage = (Number of deer with tags from previous year / Total number of deer caught in 2002) x 100
Percentage = (20/500) x 100 = 4%

We are told that this percentage is representative of the total deer population with tags. Let P be the total deer population in the forest.
Therefore, the number of deer with tags that were caught in the 500 deer sample is also 4% of P:
Number of deer with tags = 0.04P

We know that in 2001, 300 deer were tagged. We can assume that no tags were lost, so the number of tagged deer in the forest at the beginning of 2002 is also 300.

During 2002, the total number of tagged deer in the forest was the sum of the number of tagged deer in 2001 that were still alive and the number of deer that were tagged in 2002. Since only 20 tagged deer were caught in the 500 deer sample, we can assume that most of the tagged deer in the forest at the beginning of 2002 were still alive at the end of 2002. Therefore:
Number of tagged deer in the forest at the end of 2002 = 300 + (500 - 20) = 780

We can now set up an equation based on the fact that the percentage of deer with tags in the 500 deer sample is representative of the total deer population with tags:

  (a + b)2 - 4ab = a2 + 2ab + b2 - 4ab = a2 - 2ab + b2 = (a - b)2
  (a - b)2 / (a + b)2 = [(a + b)2 - 4ab] / (a + b)2 = 1 - 4ab / (a + b)2
  So, (a - b)2 / (a + b)2 = 1 - 4ab / (a + b)2
  
  To compare with the given equation (a - b)2, we equate this value to (a - b)2;
  1 - 4ab / (a + b)2 = (a - b)2
  1 - 4ab / (a + b)2 = a2 - 2ab + b2
  1 = a2 + 2ab + b2 - 4ab + a2 - 2ab + b2
  0 = 2a2 - 2ab + 2b2 - 4ab
  0 = 2a2 - 6ab + 2b2
  0 = a2 - 3ab + b2
  0 = (a - b)(a - 2b)
  a = 2b or a = b
  
  We don't know the value of a or b, so we can't form a unique answer to the given equation.
  Therefore, the answer is E: None of these.

Working:
  a^2 - b^2/(a + b)^2 = (a - b)^2
  Multiply both sides by (a + b)^2
  a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)^2 * (a + b)^2
  a^2 - b^2 = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2) * (a^2 + 2ab + b^2)

  (a-b)(a+b) / (a+b)(a+b) = (a-b)2
  (a-b) gets cancelled from both sides.

The question involves algebraic manipulation using identities.
One of the standard identities is: (a+b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + 2ab
Another identity is: (a-b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab
Using the above two identities, the given question can be solved.
Solution: 
a^2 - b^2/(a+b)^2 = (a-b)^2
=> (a^2 - b^2)/(a+b)^2 = (a^2 - 2ab + b^2)
=> a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
=> 2b^2 = 2ab
=> b = a
Substituting b = a in the given question, we get:
a^2 - a^2/(2a)^2 = (a-a)^2
=> a^2 - a^2/4 = 0
=> 3a^2/4 = a^2/4
=> a^2 = a^2
The value of the expression is independent of the value of 'a' and 'b'.

  From the question, we know that she got $3.40 in total. This can be represented as 340 cents.

Calculation:
  We can set up two equations based on the information provided in the question:

  x + y = z             (total number of coins she brought)

  We can solve this system of equations to find the values of x, y, and z:
  
  0.20x + 0.25y = 3.40    (multiply by 100 to eliminate decimals)
  20x + 25y = 340

  x + y = z

  Now we can use substitution to solve for x in terms of y:
  
  x = z - y
  
  Substituting into the first equation:

  20z + 5y = 340
  4z + y = 68

  Now we want to find the minimum value of x, which means we want to find the minimum value of y that satisfies the equation.
  Since y must be a positive integer, let's try different values of y starting from 1:
  
  y = 1, then x = z - 1, and 4z + 1 = 68, which is not possible.
  y = 2, then x = z - 2, and 4z + 2 = 68, which is not possible.
  y = 3, then x = z - 3, and 4z + 3 = 68, which is possible. Solving for z, we get z = 16.

  However, we need to check if it is possible to get $3.40 by bringing a combination of copper and brass coins. 
  Let's assume that she brought 1 brass coin instead of 1 copper coin. 
  This means that she brought 16 copper coins and 1 brass coin. 
  For the 16 copper coins, she would get 20*16 = 320 cents. 
  For the 1 brass coin, she would get 25 cents. 
  In total, she would get 320 + 25 = 345 cents, which is more than $3.40. 
  Therefore, it is not possible to get $3.40 by bringing 16 copper coins and 1 brass coin.

  Let's assume that the number of copper coins the diver brought is ""x"" and the number of brass coins she brought is ""y"". 
  From the problem statement, we know that:
  - The diver gets 20 cents for each copper coin (""x"" copper coins).
  - The diver gets 25 cents for each brass coin (""y"" brass coins).
  - The total amount she got from the dive is $3.40.
  Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 
  20x + 25y = 340 cents
  
  A, B, C, D, E: These choices represent the different values of ""x"" that we need to check to see which one satisfies the above equation.

Action: Answer(""A"")  
Explanation: 
  Let's start with the first choice: x = 4.
  If the diver brought 4 copper coins, then the number of brass coins she brought is:
  y = (340 - 20x)/25 = (340 - 80)/25 = 8/5, which is not a whole number. 
  Since ""y"" has to be a whole number, we can rule out choice B, C, D, and E.
  
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 4, which means the number of brass coins is 6:
  20(4) + 25(6) = 80 + 150 = 230 cents.
  This is the only combination that satisfies the equation and adds up to $3.40.

  Let's assume the number of copper coins to be x and the number of brass coins to be y.
  The amount earned by bringing each copper coin is 20 cents.
  The total value of x copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount earned by bringing each brass coin is 25 cents.
  The total value of y brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total earnings after one dive are $3.40 or 340 cents.
  So we can write an equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  To find the minimum number of copper coins, we need to find the values of x and y where 20x + 25y = 340 and x is minimum.

Calculation:
  We can simplify the equation 20x + 25y = 340 by dividing both sides by 5:
  4x + 5y = 68
  We need to find the minimum value of x such that x is a non-negative integer. The minimum value of x that satisfies the equation is 2.
  If x = 2, then 4(2) + 5y = 68
  Solving for y, we get y = 12.

  Let's assume that the coin-diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  For each copper coin, she gets 20 cents, therefore, the total amount she gets from copper coins is 20x.
  For each brass coin, she gets 25 cents, therefore, the total amount she gets from brass coins is 25y.
  The total amount she got from both types of coins is $3.40, therefore: 20x + 25y = 340.
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize x.

Solution:
  We can use trial and error starting from the smallest possible value of x, which is 0. 
  If x = 0, then 25y = 340, which means y is not an integer, and this is impossible.
  If x = 1, then 20 + 25y = 340, which means 25y = 320, and y = 12.8, which is not an integer.
  If x = 2, then 40 + 25y = 340, which means 25y = 300, and y = 12, which is an integer.

  Let's assume that the diver got x copper coins and y brass coins. 
  The amount earned from the copper coins = 20x cents
  The amount earned from the brass coins = 25y cents
  The total amount earned = 340 cents
  We need to find the value of x such that the total amount earned is 340 cents and the number of copper coins is minimized.

Calculation:
  Let's start by assuming that the diver did not bring any brass coin and brought all copper coins.
  In this case, the amount earned = 20x cents
  To get a total of 340 cents, the value of x = 17
  Therefore, the diver brought 17 copper coins and earned (20 * 17) = 340 cents
  However, we need to minimize the number of copper coins.
  To minimize the number of copper coins, we need to replace each copper coin with a brass coin.
  By doing so, the total amount earned will increase by (25-20) = 5 cents for each coin.
  Therefore, we need to replace 17 copper coins with brass coins to reach the total amount of 340 cents.

  The total number of coins she brought up from the river = C + B.
  She got $3.40 in total. 
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20C + 25B = 340 cents.

To find out the minimum number of copper coins she brought, we need to find the value of C that satisfies the above equation and makes C as small as possible.
Since the equation contains two variables, we need one more equation to solve for both C and B.

Since we want to minimize the number of copper coins, let's assume that she brought up no brass coins at all. In that case, the value of B would be zero.

  (4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.

Processing:
  We need to check each of the pairs given in the options and see if Y can accompany both of them based on the given conditions.

A: G and H
  If Y is H accompaniment, then X cannot be H accompaniment (from (3)). So, X is F accompaniment, and W is L accompaniment (from (1)). Since F and G do not share accompaniment (from (4)), X cannot be G accompanist. So, Y is M accompaniment (from (2)). So, Y can accompany G and H.

B: L and H
  If Y is H accompaniment, then X cannot be H accompaniment (from (3)). So, X is F accompaniment, and W is L accompaniment (from (1)). Since L and K do not share accompaniment (from (4)), K is accompanied by Y. So, Y cannot accompany L and H.

C: F and L
  If Y is H accompaniment, then X cannot be H accompaniment (from (3)). So, X is G accompaniment and Y is M accompaniment (from (2)). Then, W is L accompaniment (from (1)). So, Y cannot accompany F and L.

  If X is not a G accompanist, then Y is an M accompanist.
  X or Y is H accompanist.
  F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.

Approach:
  We can eliminate each choice where Y accompanies at least one of the two singers in the pair, then check if the remaining information can accommodate the pair.

Action:
  Let’s start with option A:
  A: G and H. If Y accompanied G and H, then X should not be G accompaniment, which means Y should be M accompaniment. But then, according to (3), X should be H accompanist, which is not possible. Therefore, A is possible.
  
  Let's check option B:
  B: L and H. If Y accompanied L and H, then X should be F accompaniment and W should be G accompanist. This satisfies the conditions as given. So, B is possible.
  
  Let's check option C:
  C: F and L. If Y accompanied F and L, then X should not be F and Y should be M accompanist according to the given condition. But, according to the given conditions, we know that if X is not F accompanist, then W should be L accompanist. So, this is not possible. Therefore, C is not possible.
  
  Let's check option D:
  D: F and M. If Y accompanied F and M, then X should not be G accompanist. Therefore, X should be F accompanist and W should be L accompanist. But, according to the given condition, if X is F accompanist, then Y should be L accompanist which isn't possible. Therefore, D is not possible.

  (4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.

To determine which pair of singers Y can not accompany, we can use process of elimination.

If we assume Y is H's accompaniment, then X is not H's accompaniment and therefore is M's accompaniment. By (2), Y cannot be M's accompaniment, thus Y cannot be H's accompaniment. Therefore, X must be H's accompaniment. 
From (1), if X is F's accompaniment, then W must be L's accompaniment. If X is not F's accompaniment, then X must be H's accompaniment and Y must be L's accompaniment. Thus, the possible pairs of accompaniments for the singers are:
  F: X, L: W, G: Y

  (4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.
  
Process of elimination:
- According to condition (1), if X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment. Therefore, F cannot be with W, and L cannot be with X or Y. Thus, L must be with W.
- According to condition (2), if X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment. Therefore, if X accompanies F, then Y accompanies M; if Y accompanies F, then X accompanies M. However, if Y accompanies L, then X must accompany K (since H and M don't share accompaniment), and G will be left without an accompanist. Therefore, Y cannot accompany L. Thus, Y must accompany F.
- According to condition (3), X or Y is H accompaniment. Therefore, H cannot be with W (since L must be with W). Thus, H must be with X or Y (but not both).
- According to condition (4), F and G do not share accompaniment. Therefore, G must be with W (since L must be with W) and X must accompany K.

  (3) X or Y is H accompaniment.
  (4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment.

Solution:
  From condition (4), we know that F and G do not share accompaniment. So, Y must be an accompaniment for F or H.
  From condition (1), if X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment. Therefore, if Y is L accompaniment, then X is F accompaniment.
  From condition (2), if X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment. Therefore, if X is F accompaniment, then Y is M accompaniment.
  From condition (3), X or Y is H accompaniment. Therefore, if Y is M accompaniment, then X is H accompaniment.
  So, we can conclude that X is H accompaniment, Y is M accompaniment, and W is L accompaniment.
  From condition (4), L and K do not share accompaniment, so K's accompaniment must be X or Y. From condition (2), K's accompaniment cannot be Y. Therefore, K's accompaniment is X.
  From condition (4), H and M do not share accompaniment, so G's accompaniment must be Y or W. From condition (2), if G's accompaniment is W, then Y is M accompaniment which is not possible since Y is K's accompaniment. Therefore, G's accompaniment is Y.

  If S is scheduled for the sixth week and O and S cannot perform continuously, then O must be scheduled either in the fourth or seventh week.
  If R is scheduled in the second week, then the weeks for K, J, and S will be limited and cannot be arranged in sequential order.
  If R is scheduled in the fourth week, then F and J must be arranged to perform in the fifth and sixth week, respectively, which satisfies the condition that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.

Explanation: 
  Choice A provides an alternative scenario where after the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.

Therefore, even if people did not consume during the period when the economy was sluggish, they will still consume when the economy improves, and this will lead to an improvement in the economy. Answer B is not relevant to the argument. Answer C is incorrect because necessities are still goods, but Li Ming argued that people do not have money to buy goods beyond necessities.

A: This choice introduces the idea that after the economic situation improves, companies will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed. However, this statement doesn't directly address Li Ming's argument that falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions due to lack of consumption by the unemployed.

  A: This statement suggests that as the economy improves, more people will be reemployed, and they will buy goods that were previously delayed, which could help the economy.
  B: This statement does not address Li Ming's argument and is irrelevant to the discussion.
  C: This statement suggests that even when the economy is extremely deteriorating, the unemployed must continue to buy necessities such as food, which could help the economy.

  Zhang Qiang argues that a sluggish economy leads to unemployment, which leads to reduced living expenses, which leads to further unemployment and worsening of the economy. However, when prices fall to the lowest point, people begin to increase their consumption, which leads to improved economic conditions.
  Li Ming argues that unemployed people cannot increase their consumption, and falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Action: Answer(""D"")
Explanation: 
  Choice A does not weaken Li Ming's rebuttal because it refers to the future, not the current situation. 
  Choice B is irrelevant as it does not address the argument between Zhang Qiang and Li Ming.
  Choice C does not weaken Li Ming's rebuttal because buying necessities does not necessarily lead to improved economic conditions.
  Choice D is the best answer because it suggests that even during a period of economic deterioration, unemployed people can still save money and increase their consumption when prices fall to the lowest point, which could lead to improved economic conditions.

Analysis:
  If Tao was recruited second, the sequence must start with one of Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, or White. Stanton cannot be first in the sequence, because he cannot immediately follow Tao. Therefore, Stanton must be recruited after the first person, and since Peters was recruited fourth, we know he cannot be first either. This leaves Quinn, Rovero, Villas, and White. If Villas preceded White, then Quinn must be third, which contradicts clause 2. Therefore, Villas must be immediately before White. This means the sequence is either Q-R-V-W or R-Q-V-W. Since Tao is second, the first person must be one of Quinn or Rovero. If the first person is Quinn, the sequence is Q-R-V-W, so Rovero must be fifth, and Stanton must be recruited sixth.

  Seven people were recruited.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Tao was recruited second.
  
Logic:
  Since Tao was recruited second, we know that Peters was recruited third. Quinn is recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be first or second. Since Peters was recruited fourth, Quinn must be first. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be last. That leaves Stanton and Rovero, and we know Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Rovero must be fifth. That means Stanton must be sixth.

Using the given information, we can determine that the order in which the accomplices were recruited is: Peters, Tao, _, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton. We can also conclude that Stanton was recruited either third or sixth and that Quinn was recruited before Rovero. 

A: If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero would have to be recruited sixth, which would mean that Villas was recruited fifth. However, the given information states that Villas was recruited immediately before White, which would not be true in this case. Therefore, A is not true.
B: If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton would have to be recruited sixth, which would mean that Villas was recruited fourth and White was recruited seventh. This would not be a valid order of recruitment since Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, B is not true.
C: If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Rovero would have to be recruited fifth, which would mean that Villas was recruited fourth and White was recruited seventh. This would not be a valid order of recruitment since Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, C is not true.
D: If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which would mean that Stanton was recruited fifth and Rovero was recruited fourth. However, the given information states that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, which would not be true in this case. Therefore, D is not true.
E: If White was recruited third, then Villas would have to be recruited second, which would mean that Peters was recruited fifth. This would not be a valid order of recruitment since Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, E is not true.

Since none of the options are true, the answer is ""None of the Above"". However, the most likely answer is B, since it is the option that is closest to being true.

  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
To consider all of the conditions, we can test each answer choice to see if it is possible.

Testing Answer Choice A:
Performing S fourth means that the compositions performed before it cannot be O or L/H (as stated in Condition 6). Therefore, the list of the compositions performed before S must be F, H, and either L or O (not P or R because they are performed at some time before or after S). If L is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before F and after R because there must be at least two compositions performed in between. Similarly, if H is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before R and after F. Thus, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H, and it must be performed between P and S. Therefore, the order of the compositions performed can be O, L/H, F, P, S, R, T. This order satisfies all of the given conditions. 

Testing Answer Choice B:
Performing S fourth means that the compositions performed before it cannot be O or L/H (as stated in Condition 6). Therefore, the list of the compositions performed before S must be H, L, and either O or F (not P or R because they are performed at some time before or after S). If L is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before F and after R because there must be at least two compositions performed in between. Similarly, if H is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before R and after F. Thus, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H, and it must be performed between P and S. However, there is no way to satisfy Condition 2 because there can be at most one composition performed before H and at most one composition performed after L. Therefore, this order cannot be accurate.

Testing Answer Choice C:
Performing S fourth means that the compositions performed before it cannot be O or L/H (as stated in Condition 6). Therefore, the list of the compositions performed before S must be O, P, and either L or H (not F or R because they are performed at some time before or after S). If L is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before F and after R because there must be at least two compositions performed in between. Similarly, if H is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before R and after F. Thus, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H, and it must be performed between P and S. However, there is no way to satisfy both Condition 1 and Condition 2 because the only compositions that can be performed immediately before F or immediately after R are T and O, respectively. Therefore, this order cannot be accurate.

Testing Answer Choice D:
Performing S fourth means that the compositions performed before it cannot be O or L/H (as stated in Condition 6). Therefore, the list of the compositions performed before S must be O, P, and either L or H (not F or R because they are performed at some time before or after S). If L is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before F and after R because there must be at least two compositions performed in between. Similarly, if H is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before R and after F. Thus, the eighth composition performed must be either L or H, and it must be performed between P and S. Therefore, the order of the compositions performed can be O, P, T, F, L/H, S, R. This order satisfies all of the given conditions.

Testing Answer Choice E:
Performing S fourth means that the compositions performed before it cannot be O or L/H (as stated in Condition 6). Therefore, the list of the compositions performed before S must be P, R, and either L or H (not F or O because they are performed at some time before or after S). If L is the eighth composition performed, it cannot be performed before F and after R because there must be at least two compositions performed in between.

  4. The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  5. P is performed at some time before S.
  6. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, then O must be performed first or fifth, which satisfies condition 3. Also, P is performed before S, so P cannot be the first or second composition. This leaves us with two possible options: either O is performed first, or O is performed fifth. We can try out both options:
  
  Option 1: O is performed first.
  In this case, P cannot be the second composition as it comes before S. So P must be the third composition. Also, T cannot be the immediate neighbor of O as its only possible neighbors are R and F. Thus, T must be performed immediately before F. This leaves us with only one possibility for the order of compositions 4 through 8: H, L, R, S, which also satisfies the other conditions. Therefore, the order of compositions can be: O, P, T, F, H, L, R, S.
  
  Option 2: O is performed fifth.
  In this case, P cannot be the third composition as it comes before S. So P must be the first composition. Also, T cannot be the immediate neighbor of O as its only possible neighbors are R and F. Thus, T must be performed immediately after R. This leaves us with two possible options for the order of compositions 2 through 4: H, L, F or F, H, L. However, neither of these options can be extended to a valid order of all 8 compositions, as there would be no valid position for S. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  
  Therefore, the only possible order of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, if S is performed fourth is: O, P, T.

  We have a total of seven sales representatives.
Action: Answer(""C"")  
Explanation: 
  Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone and either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1. Since there are only three zones, and Zones 1 and 2 are already taken by Tiao and Udall respectively, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3. Since there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least three people in Zone 3, which means that Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3. That leaves Kim and Mahr for Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.

  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  More sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
Solution:
  From the conditions, we know that:
  - If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1.
  - If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2.
  - If Quinn works in Zone 3, then either Stuckey or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 3.
  
  Now, we can eliminate the choices based on these conditions:
  - If Quinn works in Zone 1, then (A), (B), (C), and (E) are possible options for sales representatives to work in the same zone as Quinn. So (D) is the answer.
  - If Quinn works in Zone 2, then (B), (C), and (E) are possible options for sales representatives to work in the same zone as Quinn. So (A) and (D) are eliminated.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
To determine who Quinn cannot work with, we need to deduce the possible combinations of zones each sales representative can work in. We know that since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, Parra must be in either Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3. If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, and if Parra is in Zone 2, then Udall cannot be in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 3. 
Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, and no more than 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
From the given conditions, we know that:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, the other one must work in Zone 3.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, the other one must work in Zone 3.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and since Udall cannot work in Zone 2, they must both work in Zone 3.
- So, there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 3, and only 3 can work in Zone 1 and Zone 2 combined.

Possible combinations are:
Zone 1: Parra, Kim
Zone 2: Tiao, Mahr
Zone 3: Quinn, Stuckey, Udall

  By elimination, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, so Tiao must be in Zone 2, and Udall must be in Zone 3 with Stuckey.

If Quinn works in a sales zone, then Parra must also work in that sales zone and Stuckey and Udall must work together in another sales zone.

  - Percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  - Keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  - Saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.

To find the answer to the question, we need to determine who performs the first and second solos, and then eliminate the options that can perform the third solo based on the restrictions.

Assuming the percussionist performs first, the saxophonist performs second, and the violinist performs third, we can eliminate options B, C, and D, as they all have to perform their solos after the violinist performs. 

We are left with options A and E. 

Since we assumed the violinist performs third, the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist has to perform either the fifth or sixth solo. However, the saxophonist's solo has to happen after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. If the guitarist performs the sixth solo, the saxophonist has to perform after the trumpeter, which violates the restriction. Therefore, the guitarist must perform the fifth solo, and the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist. This means the keyboard player performs the third solo.

  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  
Analysis: 
  - From the rules, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Thus, any answer choice that assigns Robertson to any other number is incorrect.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Thus, in any answer choice that Young is assigned a lower number than Togowa, that answer choice is incorrect.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Thus, in any answer choice that Xu is assigned a lower number than Souza, that answer choice is incorrect.

  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.

A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  - Togowa has a lower-numbered parking space than Young, which violates one of the rules.
B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu

Therefore, option A is incorrect as Young would have to be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, which violates the rules. Option B is incorrect as Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6. Option D is incorrect as Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.

- Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Parra is already assigned to Zone 1, then Quinn must also be assigned to Zone 1. 
- Since Tiao and Udall cannot both be assigned to Zone 2, and Tiao is already assigned to a sales zone, Udall must be assigned to Zone 2.

Elimination:
  A: If only F and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf would have H, I, K, L, O, and at least one more book. Thus, A is incorrect.
  B: If F, H and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf would have G, I, K, L, and O. Thus, B is incorrect.
  C: None of G, H or K can be on the bottom shelf since K is placed higher than F and we need more books on the bottom shelf. Thus, C is incorrect.
  D: If F, G, M and O are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf would have H, I, K and L. Thus, D is a possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.

  4. K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  5. O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  6. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  
Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
- A cannot be true because it only has two books and there should be at least two books on each shelf.
- C cannot be true because it does not have any of the books that should be on the bottom shelf according to condition 1.
- E cannot be true because it has L on the bottom shelf, and according to condition 5, L should be on a higher shelf than O.

That leaves us with two choices: B and D. 
- B has F, H, and M, but we cannot place H on the bottom shelf because there should be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, B cannot be true.
- Therefore, the answer is D because it has all the books that should be on the bottom shelf according to condition 1, and it satisfies all the other conditions as well.

  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, which means it is not placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, which means K is not placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, which means O and L cannot both be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, which means they are either both on the top, middle, or bottom shelf together.
Action: Answer(""B"") 
Explanation: 
  According to the given conditions, I cannot be on the bottom shelf, which means F and M are both on the same shelf, and it's either the top, middle, or bottom shelf. Since at least two books are on each shelf, we can eliminate the possibility of both F and M being on the top shelf. Therefore, F and M must be on either the middle or bottom shelf together. However, we know that the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. So, we can conclude that F and M must be on the bottom shelf. And since we need at least two books on each shelf, the possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf is {F, H, M}. But we know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf. Similarly, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L. Therefore, the only possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf is {F, H, M}. Hence, the answer is B.

  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.

Analysis:
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, we know that the bottom shelf has at least 3 books.
  - Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  - Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is also on the bottom shelf.
  - Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is also on the bottom shelf.
  - Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, both books must be on either the top, middle, or bottom shelf.

Action: Answer(""D"") 

Explanation: 
  If we place F, G, and M on the top shelf, H and L on the middle shelf, and I, K, and O on the bottom shelf, then all the given conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.

- I is placed on the middle shelf.
- K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
- O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
- F is placed on the same shelf as M.
- There are exactly 8 books placed on 3 shelves.

Given that at least 2 books are placed on each shelf and more of them are placed on the bottom shelf, we can deduce that the books that are placed on the bottom shelf are at least 3.

We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it means that I cannot be on the bottom shelf.

Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we can deduce that neither K nor F are on the bottom shelf.

Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, we can deduce that neither O nor L are on the bottom shelf.

F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they are either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf or both on the bottom shelf. 

Option A is not possible since it only has two books, which is not enough for the bottom shelf. 

Option B is not possible, since F and M cannot be on the bottom shelf because F must be on the same shelf as M.

Option C is not possible since none of the listed books can be on the bottom shelf. 

Option D is possible: we could place F and M on the bottom shelf, G on the middle shelf, and H, I, K, L and O on the top shelf.

  The argument claims that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them, and people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not.
  
A: This answer choice states that many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch. However, it does not address whether watching more television leads to an even greater overestimation of risks associated with natural disasters. Hence, this answer choice does not weaken the argument.
  
B: This answer choice states that a person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television. This completely contradicts the argument's premise that watching more television leads to an overestimation of natural disaster risks. Hence, this answer choice weakens the argument and is the correct answer.

Explanation: 
The psychologist's argument is about the obligation to express gratitude and its social function. The claim that gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously is not the argument's main conclusion, but rather is a premise that supports a more general claim about the importance of personal interaction. This more general claim is then used to support the argument's main conclusion, namely that positively reinforcing behaviors that benefit others requires that the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. So, option C is the best choice because it correctly identifies that the claim is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.

  The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and notes the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules instantiated in localized brain regions. The passage also notes that some critics argue against this theory, suggesting that mental processes are properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The passage notes that brain scans produced by the subtractive method are not a clear indicator of neat functional localization, since the entire brain is active in both the control and cognitive task conditions.

Analysis:
  None of the answer choices accurately reflect the information presented in the passage. 
  A: The passage does not state that most cognition depends on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain. In fact, the passage notes that the modular theory of mind may be faulty because it may not be possible to decompose mental activity into independent modules.

  The FMRI measures the differential rate of oxygen use by subtracting the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement.
  The subtractive method in FMRI obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.
  
Action: Answer(""C"") 
The statement most strongly supported by the passage is: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This is supported by the discussion of the FMRI as a measure of metabolic activity in response to different cognitive tasks and the subtraction of the baseline measurement from the on-task measurement. The subtractive method is described as producing a false impression of functional localization because it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions. The debate about the modular theory of mind and the potential invalidity of decomposing mental processes into separate modules is also discussed, but not as strongly supported as the statement about metabolic activity during cognitive tasks.

  Plants contain two categories of chemical substances: primary and secondary.
  The primary substances, such as proteins, carbohydrates, vitamins, and hormones, are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants.
  The secondary substances are a diverse and multitudinous array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism.
  Some secondary substances are favored by natural selection because they are scents that attract pollinating insects to blossoms.
  Other secondary substances that arose by mutation were conserved by natural selection because they proved to be biochemical defenses against the enemies of plants, the majority of which are insects.
  Still, other secondary substances are not in themselves harmful to insects, but are characteristic smells or tastes that dissuade the insect from feeding by warning it of the presence of some other substance that is harmful.

Action: Answer(""B"") 
Explanation: 
  The relationship between plants and their primary and secondary substances is analogous to the relationship between automobiles and mechanical components such as engines and transmissions, and features such as paint and taillights. The mechanical components are necessary for the automobile to run, while the features serve to give it its distinctive look and serve additional functions such as preventing rust and improving safety. Similarly, primary substances are necessary for the plant's growth and proper functioning, while secondary substances give plants their distinctive tastes and smells and serve additional functions such as attracting pollinating insects and defending against plant-eating insects.

  The passage includes the ideas of two authors, Tocqueville and Mill, in relation to the position of the individual in society.
  Tocqueville's views on the position of the individual in society are presented as follows: the social changes that bring nearer to the same level the father and son, the master and servant, and superiors and inferiors generally speaking, will raise woman and make her more and more the equal of man. Tocqueville believes that the Americans have applied to the sexes the great principle of political economy which governs the manufactures of our age, by carefully dividing the duties of man from those of woman, in order that the great work of society may be the better carried on.
  Mill's views on the position of the individual in society are presented as follows: The proper sphere for all human beings is the largest and highest which they are able to attain to. What this is, cannot be ascertained without complete liberty of choice.

  The study used northern bald ibises to study the reasons for bird migration in V formations.
  The study involved microlight planes, data loggers, and GPS to track the birds' movement and wing flaps.
  The ibises positioned themselves to fly just behind and to the side of the bird in front, timing their wing beats to catch the uplifting eddies.
  When a bird flew directly behind another, the timing of the flapping reversed so that it could minimize the effects of the downdraft coming off the back of the bird's body.

The equation provided gives the relation between the temperature and the speed of sound in air. The coefficient of $T$ in the equation is the rate of change of the speed of sound with respect to temperature.

Action: Answer(""A"")

Explanation:
The equation given is $S(T)=0.6 T+331.4$, and the coefficient of $T$ is $0.6$. This means that a unit increase in temperature causes a $0.6$ unit increase in the speed of sound. The term $331.4$ in the equation is the value of the speed of sound when the temperature is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is the reference point for the linear relationship. Therefore, the best interpretation of the number $331.4$ in the context of this problem is that it represents the speed of sound, in meters per second, at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Putting it all together, we have:
$$P(\text{Group Y}|\text{at least 1 dream}) = \frac{P(\text{Group Y and at least 1 dream})}{P(\text{at least 1 dream})} = \frac{79/200}{164/200} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}$$

gpt-35-turbo,self_recitation,comprehensive-100,0.8,69,9,"We are interested in finding the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream. We can use the formula for conditional probability:

$$P(Y|1\text{ or more dreams}) = \frac{P(Y \cap 1\text{ or more dreams})}{P(1\text{ or more dreams})}$$

We can find $P(1\text{ or more dreams})$ by adding the number of people in each group who recalled 1 or more dreams and dividing by the total number of people:

$$P(1\text{ or more dreams}) = \frac{28+57+11+68}{200} = \frac{164}{200}$$

$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}}=\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}=\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$

Then, we can simplify the fraction using the formula above: 

$\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}=\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}=\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}\cdot\frac{\frac{1}{x+2}\cdot\frac{1}{x+3}}{\frac{1}{x+2}\cdot\frac{1}{x+3}}$

$\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}\cdot\frac{\frac{1}{x+2}\cdot\frac{1}{x+3}}{\frac{1}{x+2}\cdot\frac{1}{x+3}}=\frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}\cdot\frac{x+2+x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}}=\frac{1}{\frac{(2x+5)(2x+5)}{(x+2)(x+3)^2}}=\frac{(x+2)(x+3)^2}{(2x+5)(2x+5)}$

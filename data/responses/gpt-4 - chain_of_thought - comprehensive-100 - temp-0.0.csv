The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost per meter is Rs.2. Therefore, the total length of the paper used is 260/2 = 130 meters. Since the paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5 meters, the total area covered by the paper is 130*0.5 = 65 square meters. 

We are told that 15 square meters are allowed for doors and windows, so the total area of the walls is 65+15 = 80 square meters. 

The semi-perimeter of the room is the perimeter divided by 2. The area of the walls is the height of the room times the semi-perimeter. Therefore, the semi-perimeter is 80/height. 

We are told that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, height/semi-perimeter = 2/5. Substituting semi-perimeter = 80/height, we get height/(80/height) = 2/5. Solving for height, we get height^2 = 80*2/5 = 32. Therefore, height = sqrt(32) = 5.66 meters. 

However, this is not one of the choices. We must have made a mistake. Let's go back and check our work. 

The mistake is in the calculation of the semi-perimeter. The area of the walls is the height of the room times the semi-perimeter, so the semi-perimeter is 80/height. 

We are told that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. Therefore, height/semi-perimeter = 2/5. Substituting semi-perimeter = 80/height, we get height/(80/height) = 2/5. Solving for height, we get height^2 = 80*2/5 = 32. Therefore, height = sqrt(32) = 5.66 meters. 

This is still not one of the choices. We must have made another mistake. 

The mistake is in the calculation of the ratio. The ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, so height = 2/5 * semi-perimeter. Substituting semi-perimeter = 80/height, we get height = 2/5 * (80/height). Solving for height, we get height^2 = 2/5 * 80 = 32. Therefore, height = sqrt(32) = 5.66 meters.

  The value of the 50 paise coins is 0.50x rupees.
  The value of the one rupee coins is 1x rupees.
  The total value of all the coins is 0.25x + 0.50x + 1x = 1.75x rupees.
  We know that 1.75x = 700, so we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.75.
  x = 700 / 1.75 = 400.
  Therefore, there are 400 of each type of coin.

  The total amount is Rs. 700, which is equal to 70000 paise (since 1 Rupee = 100 paise).
  Let's denote the number of each type of coin as 'x'.
  The total value of the coins is the sum of the value of each type of coin, which is 25x (for the 25 paise coins) + 50x (for the 50 paise coins) + 100x (for the one rupee coins).
  Therefore, the equation to solve is 25x + 50x + 100x = 70000.
  Simplifying this equation gives 175x = 70000.
  Solving for 'x' gives x = 70000 / 175 = 400.
  Therefore, there are 400 of each type of coin.

  The ratio 5 : 3 means that the length of the ribbon was reduced from 5 parts to 3 parts.
  To find the new length, we need to calculate the value of each part.
  Each part is equal to the original length divided by 5 (30 cm / 5 = 6 cm).
  The new length is 3 parts, so it's 3 * 6 cm = 18 cm.

  The research findings suggest that the meteorites found are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of a huge meteorite that hit Quebec, Canada. The evidence for this includes high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are usually found in meteorites, and the presence of special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques. The presence of marine plankton fossils in the upper and lower strata suggests that the impact period was about 215 million years ago.
  Choice A: This doesn't directly support the research findings as it doesn't provide evidence for the meteorite impact or the age of the rocks.
  Choice B: This could potentially support the research findings as it provides a time frame that matches with the estimated impact period. However, it doesn't directly provide evidence for the meteorite impact.

  The argument states that human activities led to the extinction of large mammals in North America 12,000 years ago. However, it also mentions that the climate warmed around the same time. This could suggest that climate change, rather than human activities, could have led to the extinction of these animals.

  D: Villas was recruited sixth. This is not possible because if Villas was recruited sixth, White would be seventh, and there is no place for Stanton.
  E: White was recruited third. This is not possible because Villas must be recruited immediately before White, and Villas cannot be second because Stanton cannot be third.

  So, the answer is between A, B, and C. Let's try to make a possible order:
  1 - Quinn (because Rovero cannot be first)
  2 - Tao
  3 - Rovero (because Stanton cannot be third)
  4 - Peters
  5 - Stanton (because Villas and White must be together in the order)
  6 - Villas
  7 - White

  In this order, Stanton was recruited sixth, so the answer is C: Stanton was recruited sixth.

  Tao was recruited second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be first or third.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so they must be together in the order.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Rovero cannot be first, second, or third.
  Given these constraints, let's see which of the options could be true.

  A: Quinn was recruited third. This could be true as there's no rule against it.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. This could also be true as there's no rule against it.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. This could be true as there's no rule against it.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. This cannot be true because if Villas was sixth, White would have to be seventh, but we know Peters was recruited fourth, so there's no place for Peters.
  E: White was recruited third. This cannot be true because Villas was recruited immediately before White, so if White was third, Villas would be second, but we know Tao was second.

  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.

  Given these constraints, let's analyze each option:
  A: Quinn was recruited third. This could be possible, but it would mean Rovero would have to be fifth or later, which would conflict with Peters being fourth.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth. This could be possible, but it would mean Quinn would have to be fourth or earlier, which would conflict with Peters being fourth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth. This could be possible, as it doesn't conflict with any of the given conditions.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth. This could not be possible, as it would mean White would have to be seventh, which would conflict with Stanton not being third.
  E: White was recruited third. This could not be possible, as it would mean Villas would have to be second, which would conflict with Tao being second.

But this would mean that Parra and Quinn must be in Zone 3, which contradicts the last condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  - Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 1 and Tiao must be in Zone 2. This means Udall and Stuckey are also in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn are in the same zone, so Quinn must also be in Zone 1.
  - This leaves Kim and Mahr to be in Zone 3, which satisfies the last condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 could be Kim and Mahr.

  From the conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2, and Udall must also be in Zone 2 (because Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone). But this contradicts the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. So, Parra cannot be in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Parra must be in Zone 2. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, Quinn must also be in Zone 2. And since Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, they must be in Zone 3. 

  So far, we have:
  - Zone 1: Tiao
  - Zone 2: Parra, Quinn
  - Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall

  The remaining sales representatives, Kim and Mahr, must be in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall.

It is not used to counter a consideration, identify a social benefit, or as the conclusion of the argument. It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.

The argument is based on the comparison between H pylori and M tuberculosis. The author argues that just because a small percentage of people get sick from a bacterium, it doesn't mean the bacterium is a commensal. The author uses the example of M tuberculosis to support this argument. If it's true that people who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence, it would undermine the argument's reasoning because it would show a key difference between H pylori and M tuberculosis. H pylori allegedly strengthens immune response (a benefit), while M tuberculosis does not.

  The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it creates an illusion of functional localization in the brain. The author argues that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and on-task), and gives a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. This seems to support the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the author suggests that this theory may not be valid, as mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules and may instead be properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.

The author argues that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and on-task), and gives a false impression of neat functional localization by subtracting out all the distributed brain functions. This seems to support the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the author suggests that this theory may not be valid, as mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules and may instead be properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.

  Therefore, the author would most likely agree with statement D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans in psychology. It explains that the use of brain scans in psychology is based on the premise that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, and these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the passage also mentions that this premise may not be entirely accurate, as mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The passage also explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works, stating that it depicts the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain. The passage does not support the statements in options A, B, and E. Option D is not strongly supported by the passage, as it does not specifically mention that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times. Option C, however, is supported by the passage, as it explains that the FMRI depicts the differential rate of oxygen use, which could indicate that the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use during the performance of certain cognitive tasks.

  The passage discusses the modular theory of mind and the use of brain scans in psychology. It explains that the use of brain scans in psychology is based on the premise that the mind can be divided into separate modules, each of which is associated with a specific region of the brain. However, the passage also suggests that this premise may not be accurate, as mental processes may not be decomposable into independent modules. The passage then explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works, stating that it measures the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain. This is done by taking a baseline measurement of oxygen use in the brain, then taking a second measurement while the subject is performing a cognitive task. The baseline measurement is then subtracted from the on-task measurement, with the reasoning being that whatever remains after the subtraction represents the metabolic activity associated solely with the cognitive task in question. The passage suggests that this method may give a false impression of functional localization in the brain, as it obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  Based on this information, the statement most strongly supported by the passage is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain. This is supported by the explanation of how FMRI works, which involves measuring the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain during the performance of a cognitive task.

The passage mentions that five individuals developed tool-using techniques that deviated from the tool use performed by birds in the wild, most likely because the artificial crevices used in the experiment differed from natural crevices and tree holes. After initial success with this technique, these birds significantly increased their use of this method. This suggests that the birds were learning individually based on their own experiences and the specific conditions of the experiment, rather than relying on social learning or genetic predisposition.

  The passage suggests that when consumers view a large brand as being in competition with a smaller brand, support for the large brand decreases.

Therefore, if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors, it is likely that the large store would lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

  Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the eye's optic nerve and gets worse over time. It's often associated with a buildup of pressure inside the eye. The optic nerve carries visual information from the retina to the brain. The retina is made up of many cells, including ganglion cells, which are the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina. Ganglion cells are the ones that are most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Ganglion cells.

  Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the eye's optic nerve and gets worse over time. It's often associated with a buildup of pressure inside the eye. The optic nerve carries visual information from the eye to the brain. The cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy are the ganglion cells, which are a type of neuron located near the inner surface of the retina. They receive visual information from photoreceptors via various intermediate cells such as bipolar cells, amacrine cells, and horizontal cells. The ganglion cells are the final output neurons of the vertebrate retina. Ganglion cells collect visual information in their dendritic field and send it out through the optic nerve to the brain.

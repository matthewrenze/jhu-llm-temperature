The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. Therefore, the total length of the paper used is 260/2 = 130 meters.
The width of the paper is 50cm, which is 0.5m. Therefore, the total area of the paper used is 130*0.5 = 65 sq.m.
We are told that an area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the actual area of the walls is 65-15 = 50 sq.m.
The semi-perimeter of the room is the total length of the walls, which is the area of the walls divided by the height of the room. Let's denote the height of the room as h.
So, the semi-perimeter of the room is 50/h.
We are told that the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, so h/(50/h) = 2/5.
Solving this equation for h, we get h^2 = 50*2/5 = 20, so h = sqrt(20) = 4.47m.
The closest answer to 4.47m is 4.4m, so the answer is E: 4.4m.

The width of the paper is 50 cm, which is 0.5 meters. So, the total area covered by the paper is 130 * 0.5 = 65 sq.m.
We are told that 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the actual area of the walls is 65 + 15 = 80 sq.m.
The semi-perimeter of the room is the total length of the walls, which is the area divided by the height. Let's denote the height as h. So, the semi-perimeter is 80/h.
We are told that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5, so h/(80/h) = 2/5. Solving this equation for h gives h^2 = 80*2/5 = 32, so h = sqrt(32) = 5.66 meters.

The semi-perimeter of the room is the perimeter divided by 2. The area of the walls is the height of the room times the semi-perimeter.
So, we have the equation: height * semi-perimeter = 80.
We are also told that the ratio of the height to the semi-perimeter is 2:5. So, we can write: height = 2/5 * semi-perimeter.
Substituting this into the first equation, we get: 2/5 * semi-perimeter * semi-perimeter = 80.
Solving for semi-perimeter, we get: semi-perimeter = sqrt(80*5/2) = 10.
Substituting this back into the equation for height, we get: height = 2/5 * 10 = 4.

The semi-perimeter of the room is the sum of the lengths of all the walls, which is the same as the perimeter of the room divided by 2. 

Given the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, let's denote the height as 2x and the semi-perimeter as 5x. 

The total area of the walls (excluding doors and windows) is the product of the height and the semi-perimeter, which is 2x * 5x = 10x^2. 

The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260, and the cost of the paper is Rs.2 per meter. Since the paper is 50cm wide, each meter of paper covers 0.5 square meters of wall. Therefore, the total area covered by the paper is 260 / 2 * 0.5 = 65 square meters. 

Subtracting the area of the doors and windows (15 square meters), we get the actual area of the walls is 65 - 15 = 50 square meters. 

Setting this equal to the area of the walls (10x^2), we get 10x^2 = 50, which simplifies to x^2 = 5. Taking the square root of both sides, we get x = sqrt(5).

Substituting x = sqrt(5) into the expression for the height (2x), we get the height is 2*sqrt(5), which is approximately 4.47 meters.

Since the paper is 50cm wide, which is 0.5m, the total area covered by the paper is 130m * 0.5m = 65 sq.m.
The area of 15 sq.m is allowed for doors and windows, so the actual area of the walls is 65 sq.m + 15 sq.m = 80 sq.m.
The semi-perimeter of the room is the total length of the walls, which is the height of the room times 2 (since the height is measured twice, once for each wall), plus the width of the room times 2 (since the width is also measured twice, once for each wall).
Given the ratio of the height of the room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5, let's denote the height as 2x and the semi-perimeter as 5x.
The area of the walls is the height times the semi-perimeter, so 2x * 5x = 80 sq.m, which simplifies to 10x^2 = 80.
Solving for x gives x = sqrt(80/10) = sqrt(8) = 2.828m.

  The total value of the pouch is Rs. 700, or 70000 paise (since 1 Rupee = 100 paise).
  The total value of the coins can be calculated as follows: 25x (for the 25 paise coins) + 50x (for the 50 paise coins) + 100x (for the one rupee coins).
  So, the equation is 25x + 50x + 100x = 70000.

So, the equation becomes (a+b)(a-b)/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2
This simplifies to (a - b)/(a + b) = (a - b)2
So, the missing part of the equation is (a - b)/(a + b)

The given equation is a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2. We need to find what should replace the question mark.

We know that a2 - b2 = (a - b)(a + b) from the difference of squares formula.

So, if we replace the question mark with (a - b)(a + b), the equation becomes (a - b)(a + b)/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2.

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get (a - b)2 = (a - b)2, which is a true statement.

Therefore, the answer is A: (a + b)(a - b).

  The research findings suggest that the meteorites found are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of a huge meteorite that hit Quebec, Canada. The rock contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are usually found in trace amounts on the ground. This suggests that these elements are peculiar to meteorites. Therefore, the statement that would best support these findings is that elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface.

The research findings suggest that the meteorites found are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of a huge meteorite that hit Quebec, Canada. The evidence for this includes a clay layer with high concentrations of iridium and platinum, and the presence of special minerals in the formation of the late Bacques. The presence of marine plankton fossils in the upper and lower strata suggests the impact period was about 215 million years ago. 

Choice A: The rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground - This choice does not directly support the research findings. It does not provide evidence for the meteorite impact or the age of the meteorites.

Choice B: In the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale - This choice does not directly support the research findings. It does not provide evidence for the meteorite impact or the age of the meteorites.

Choice C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface - This choice supports the research findings. It explains why the high concentrations of iridium and platinum in the clay layer are evidence of a meteorite impact.

  A: G and H - If Y accompanies G and H, it does not violate any of the conditions.
  B: L and H - If Y accompanies L and H, it does not violate any of the conditions.
  C: F and L - If Y accompanies F and L, it violates condition (1) because if X is not F's accompaniment, then W cannot be L's accompaniment. Therefore, Y cannot accompany F and L.

  Let's analyze the conditions:
  (1) If X is F accompaniment, then W is L accompaniment. This means that if F is accompanied by X, then L cannot be accompanied by Y.
  (2) If X is not a G accompaniment, then Y is an M accompaniment. This means that if G is accompanied by Y, then M cannot be accompanied by Y.
  (3) X or Y is H accompaniment. This means that H can be accompanied by Y.
  (4) F and G do not share accompaniment; L and K do not share accompaniment; H and M do not share accompaniment. This means that if Y accompanies F, it cannot accompany G; if Y accompanies L, it cannot accompany K; if Y accompanies H, it cannot accompany M.
  From these conditions, it is impossible for Y to accompany the pair F and M because if Y accompanies F, it cannot accompany G and if Y accompanies M, it cannot accompany H.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F and M.

  Li Ming's argument is that unemployed people will not be able to increase their consumption due to lack of income, and therefore, falling prices will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
  To weaken this argument, we need a statement that shows how unemployed people could potentially increase their consumption even in a poor economic situation.
  Choice A suggests that reemployment will lead to increased consumption, but it doesn't address the situation while people are still unemployed.
  Choice B is about consumer belief, not actual consumption.
  Choice C just reiterates that unemployed people will buy necessities, which doesn't contradict Li Ming's argument.
  Choice D, however, suggests that even unemployed people might have some savings that they could use for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point. This directly contradicts Li Ming's argument that unemployed people will not be able to increase their consumption.

Given that S is performed fourth, we can deduce the following:
1. O cannot be performed fifth because S is in the fourth position. Therefore, O must be performed first.
2. P must be performed before S, so P could be second or third.
3. T cannot be third because it must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Neither F nor R can be performed fourth (S is fourth), so T cannot be third.
4. R cannot be third because T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and neither F nor T can be fourth (S is fourth), so R cannot be third.
5. F cannot be second or third because at least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. If F were second or third, there would not be enough positions before the fourth position (where S is) to satisfy this condition.
6. H and L do not have any restrictions that would prevent them from being second or third.
7. Therefore, the only possible combinations for the first, second, and third positions are O, P, H or O, H, P.

  To answer this question, we need to consider the trading rules and the initial ownership of the buildings. 
  The trading rules are: 
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings 

  The initial ownership of the buildings is: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). 
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. 

  Let's analyze each choice: 
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
  This could be possible if RealProp trades its Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings (Lynch Building and Meyer Building) and trades one of its class 3 buildings (Yates House or Zimmer House) for a class 2 building (Ortiz Building).

  This could be possible if Southco trades its Flores Tower (class 1) for Garza Tower (class 1) and trades its Lynch Building (class 2) for a class 2 building (Meyer Building). 

  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
  This could be possible if Southco trades its Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings (King Building and Meyer Building) and trades its Lynch Building (class 2) for a class 2 building (Ortiz Building). 

  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. 
  This could be possible if Trustcorp trades two of its class 2 buildings (King Building and Meyer Building) for a class 1 building (Flores Tower) and trades its remaining class 2 building (Ortiz Building) for a class 3 building (Yates House). 

  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.

This means the violinist and the percussionist must perform before the keyboard player. So, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo because at least two performances (violinist and percussionist) must occur before the keyboard player.
  The saxophonist must perform after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. This means the saxophonist can perform the third solo if either the percussionist or the trumpeter has performed before.
  The trumpeter has no restrictions and can perform the third solo.
  The violinist has no restrictions and can perform the third solo.
  Therefore, the keyboard player cannot perform the third solo.

  - If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2. This means that Udall cannot be in Zone 2, so Udall and Stuckey must be in Zone 3. This leaves Parra and Quinn to be in Zone 2.
  
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.

  From the conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  If we look at the choices:
  - Choice A: Kim, Mahr does not violate any conditions, but it does not help us determine the placement of the other sales representatives.
  - Choice B: Kim, Tiao violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, because if Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall must be in Zone 2, but Stuckey also has to be in the same zone as Udall, which would make Zone 2 have more representatives than Zone 3.
  - Choice C: Parra, Quinn violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, because if Parra is in Zone 3, then Tiao must be in Zone 1, but Tiao could also be in Zone 2 with Udall, which would make Zone 2 have more representatives than Zone 3.
  - Choice D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, because if Tiao and Udall are both in Zone 3, then neither of them can be in Zone 2.
  - Choice E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall does not violate any conditions. If Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall are all in Zone 3, then Tiao must be in Zone 1 (since either Parra or Tiao, but not both, must be in Zone 1), and Kim and Mahr must be in Zone 2 (since all other sales representatives are accounted for), which would make Zone 3 have more representatives than Zone 2.

  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.

A: This does not directly address the bias of the viewers who watched the debate.
B: This contradicts the initial survey results but does not address the potential bias of those who thought Lopez was better.
C: This suggests that the debate influenced voting behavior, but it does not address the potential bias of those who thought Lopez was better.
D: This suggests that viewers were initially biased towards Tanner, which could explain why they thought Lopez was better after the debate. However, it does not directly undermine the argument that those who thought Lopez was better were biased.
E: This suggests that the election was close, which could mean that the debate viewers' opinions were not necessarily influenced by the election's outcome. However, it does not directly address the potential bias of those who thought Lopez was better.

  Choice E suggests that people in disaster-prone areas watch more television, which could actually strengthen the argument by suggesting a reason why these people might overestimate the risks.
  Therefore, the answer is B: A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television.

The psychologist's argument is that human psychology is driven by personal interaction and the social function of reinforcing beneficial behaviors can only be served if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. The claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously supports this argument indirectly, as it implies that gratitude must be expressed personally for it to have its intended effect. Therefore, the role of this claim in the argument is to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion.

The passage discusses the subtractive method used in functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and how it creates an illusion of functional localization in the brain. The author suggests that this method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions (baseline and on-task) and gives a false impression of neat functional localization. This seems to support the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be analyzed into separate and distinct modules, or components, and that these modules are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the author also mentions a critique of this theory, suggesting that mental processes might not be decomposable into independent modules but are likely properties of a more general mental activity distributed throughout the brain.

The author criticizes this method for creating a false impression of functional localization in the brain, as it subtracts out all the distributed brain functions. This seems to support the modular theory of mind, which posits that the mind can be divided into separate and distinct modules, each associated with a specific brain region. However, the author suggests that this theory may not be accurate, as mental processes may be more distributed and interconnected than the modular theory suggests.

  Looking at the options, choice D: ""The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized."" aligns with the author's argument. The author does not suggest that the subtractive method is fundamentally misconceived (E), nor does he/she specifically discuss its application to medical diagnosis (A). The author does not claim that the subtractive method supports Uttal's view (B), nor does he/she discuss brain scans of individuals experiencing anger (C).

The passage suggests that this method may give a false impression of functional localization because it subtracts out all the distributed brain functions. 

  Choice A: The passage does not support this statement. It actually suggests that the modular theory of mind, which proposes that cognition depends on independent modules in specific brain regions, may not be accurate.

  Choice B: The passage does not suggest that regions of the brain not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use close to zero. It actually suggests that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

  Choice C: This statement is supported by the passage. The passage explains that FMRI shows the differential rate of oxygen use in the brain, and that the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a higher rate of oxygen use during the performance of cognitive tasks.

  The text mentions that the study took advantage of an existing project to reintroduce endangered northern bald ibises to Europe. This suggests that the ibises were chosen because they were part of an ongoing project, and thus were accessible for the study. There is no information to suggest that the ibises were well acquainted with their migration route (A), familiar with carrying data loggers (B), or have a body design similar to an airplane (C). Therefore, the most reasonable inference is that the ibises were easily accessible for Usherwood and his team to track and observe (D).

  The freezing point of water is a characteristic of water that describes the temperature at which it changes from a liquid to a solid state. This is a physical property because it describes a condition of the substance that can be observed without changing the substance's identity. It is not a chemical property or a chemical change because it does not involve a change in the substance's chemical composition. It is also not a physical change because it is a property, not a change.

  Glaucoma is a condition that causes damage to the eye's optic nerve and gets worse over time. It's often linked to a buildup of pressure inside the eye. Glaucoma tends to be inherited and may not show up until later in life. The increased pressure, called intraocular pressure, can damage the optic nerve, which transmits images to the brain. If damage to the optic nerve from high eye pressure continues, glaucoma will cause permanent loss of vision. The cells most commonly affected in glaucomatous optic atrophy are the ganglion cells.

  A history of two second trimester abortions could suggest a variety of underlying issues, including structural abnormalities, hormonal imbalances, or genetic/chromosomal abnormalities. 
  Since the question is about what investigation to advise next, it would be logical to start with a less invasive procedure that could provide a lot of information. 
  Transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can identify structural abnormalities in the uterus that could contribute to recurrent miscarriages. 
  Hysteroscopy is a more invasive procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the uterus, but it's usually not the first step in investigation.
  Endometrial biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrium) to be examined. It's usually not the first step in investigation.

  TVS (Transvaginal ultrasound) is a type of pelvic ultrasound used to look at a woman's reproductive organs, including the uterus, ovaries, and cervix. It could help identify structural abnormalities.
  Hysteroscopy is a procedure that allows your doctor to look inside your uterus in order to diagnose and treat causes of abnormal bleeding. It could also help identify structural abnormalities.
  Endometrial biopsy is a way for your doctor to take a small sample of the lining of the uterus (endometrium). It's usually done to diagnose abnormal uterine bleeding.
  Chromosomal abnormalities test is a type of genetic test that can identify whether a person has certain genetic disorders. In this case, it could help identify if the abortions were due to genetic issues.
  Given the history of two second trimester abortions, the most likely cause could be a structural problem or a chromosomal abnormality.

Let's assume that there are x 25 paise coins, x 50 paise coins, and x one rupee coins.
Since one rupee is equal to 100 paise, we can convert the number of one rupee coins to paise by multiplying it by 100.
So, we have:
0.25x + 0.5x + 100x = 700
Simplifying the equation, we get:
100.25x + 50.5x + 100x = 700
250.75x = 700
x = 700 / 250.75
x ≈ 2.8
Since x must be a whole number, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 3.
Therefore, there are 3 25 paise coins, 3 50 paise coins, and 3 one rupee coins.
The total number of coins is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9.

The frog makes a net gain of 3m - 2m = 1m each day.
However, on the day the frog reaches or exceeds the top of the well, it will not fall back down.
So, we need to calculate how many days it takes for the frog to reach a height of 29m (one meter below the top of the well), and then add one more day for the frog to jump out of the well.
It takes 29m / 1m = 29 days for the frog to reach a height of 29m.
Adding one more day for the frog to jump out of the well, the total number of days is 29 + 1 = 30 days.
However, this is not one of the available choices.
Since the frog makes a net gain of 1m each day, it must take an odd number of days for the frog to come out of the well.
Therefore, the most likely answer is the closest odd number to 30 days, which is 29 days.

The frog makes a net gain of 1m (3m - 2m) each day.
However, on the last day when the frog jumps out of the well, it won't fall back down.
So, we need to find the number of days it takes for the frog to reach a height of 29m (30m - 1m) with a net gain of 1m per day.
This will take 29 days.
On the 30th day, the frog will jump out of the well.

The frog makes a net gain of 1m (3m - 2m) each day.
However, on the last day when the frog jumps out of the well, it won't fall back down.

The frog makes a net gain of 3m - 2m = 1m each day.
However, on the day the frog reaches or exceeds the top of the well, it will not fall back down.
So, we need to calculate how many days it takes for the frog to reach a height of 29m (one meter below the top of the well), and then add one more day for the frog to jump out of the well.
It takes 29m / 1m = 29 days for the frog to reach a height of 29m.
Adding one more day for the frog to jump out of the well, the total number of days is 29 + 1 = 30 days.
However, 30 days is not one of the available choices.
The closest available choice is 29 days, but that would mean the frog has not yet reached the top of the well.

To solve this problem, we need to use the counting principle.
First, we need to find the number of ways to choose the first letter, which is a consonant and different from the third letter.
There are 20 consonants, so there are 20 choices for the first letter.
Next, we need to find the number of ways to choose the second letter, which is a vowel.
There are 5 vowels, so there are 5 choices for the second letter.
Finally, we need to find the number of ways to choose the third letter, which is a consonant and different from the first letter.
Since we have already chosen one consonant for the first letter, there are 19 remaining consonants to choose from for the third letter.
However, since the first letter and the third letter must be different, we need to subtract one from the number of choices for the third letter.
Therefore, there are 18 choices for the third letter.
To find the total number of codes, we multiply the number of choices for each letter:
20 * 5 * 18 = 1,800
However, we need to subtract the cases where the first letter and the third letter are the same.
There are 20 choices for the first letter, and for each choice, there are 4 choices for the second letter (since it must be a vowel and different from the first letter) and 1 choice for the third letter (since it must be the same as the first letter).
Therefore, there are 20 * 4 * 1 = 80 cases where the first letter and the third letter are the same.
Subtracting these cases from the total number of codes, we get:
1,800 - 80 = 1,720

* The problem states that 300 deer were tagged in 2001 and returned to the forest.
* In 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which 20 had tags from the previous year.
* We are asked to find the total deer population in the forest, assuming that the percentage of tagged deer in the 500-deer sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population.
* To find the total deer population, we can set up a proportion:
	+ (20 tagged deer in the sample) / (500 deer in the sample) = (300 tagged deer in the population) / (x total deer in the population)
* Solving for x, we get:
	+ x = (300 \* 500) / 20
	+ x = 15,000 / 20
	+ x = 750
* However, none of the answer choices match this value.
* Since the problem states that the percentage of tagged deer in the sample is representative of the percentage of tagged deer in the entire population, we can assume that the total deer population is a multiple of 500 (the sample size).
* The closest answer choice that is a multiple of 500 is 7500.

The given equation is a2 - b2/(a + b)2 = (a - b)2.
To solve for the missing term, we can first factor the numerator of the left side of the equation using the difference of squares formula: a2 - b2 = (a + b)(a - b).
This gives us (a + b)(a - b)/(a + b)2.
We can then simplify the expression by canceling out the common factor of (a + b) in the numerator and denominator, leaving us with (a - b)/(a + b).
To get the right side of the equation, we can square both sides of the equation: (a - b)2 = (a - b)(a - b).

The equation for the total amount of money she got is:

Since we want to maximize x, we can start by assuming she brought as many brass coins as possible.

0.25x + 0.20y = 3.40
To maximize x, we should try to divide 3.40 by 0.25 first.
3.40 / 0.25 = 13.6, which means she cannot have 13 or more brass coins.
So let's try x = 12:
0.25 \* 12 + 0.20y = 3.40
3 + 0.20y = 3.40
0.20y = 0.40
y = 2
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 2.

To minimize the number of copper coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins.
Let's assume she brought x brass coins and y copper coins.
The equation for the total amount of money she got is:
0.25x + 0.20y = 3.40
Since we want to maximize x, we can start by assuming she brought as many brass coins as possible.
If she brought 13 brass coins, she would have gotten 3.25 dollars, which is less than 3.40.
If she brought 14 brass coins, she would have gotten 3.50 dollars, which is more than 3.40.
Therefore, she must have brought 13 brass coins and the remaining amount must have come from copper coins.
The remaining amount is 3.40 - 3.25 = 0.15 dollars.
Since each copper coin is worth 0.20 dollars, she must have brought at least 1 copper coin.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 1.

To minimize the number of copper coins, we should maximize the number of brass coins.
Let's assume she brought x brass coins and y copper coins.
The equation for the total amount of money she got is:
25x + 20y = 340

We want to maximize x, so let's divide both sides of the equation by 5:
5x + 4y = 68

Now, we can see that x must be even, because 68 is even and 4y is always even.
Let's try x = 12, because it's the largest even number less than 68/5 = 13.6:

5 \* 12 + 4y = 68
60 + 4y = 68
4y = 8
y = 2

So, the minimum number of copper coins she brought is 2.

The research findings suggest that the meteorites found in the strata are about 200 million years old and were probably traces of flying objects when a huge meteorite hit the present province of Quebec, Canada. The rock also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground. The impact period was determined to be about 215 million years ago.

To support these findings, we need to find evidence that explains the presence of high concentrations of iridium and platinum, as well as the formation of the rock and the impact period.

Choice A suggests that the rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground. This does not directly support the research findings, as it does not explain the presence of high concentrations of iridium and platinum or the impact period.

Choice B suggests that in the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale. This does not directly support the research findings, as it does not explain the presence of high concentrations of iridium and platinum or the formation of the rock.

Choice C suggests that elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface. This directly supports the research findings, as it explains the presence of high concentrations of iridium and platinum in the rock.

The rock also contains high concentrations of elements such as iridium and platinum, which are 50 to 2000 times the concentration normally found on the ground. The impact period was determined to be about 215 million years ago.

To support these findings, we need to find evidence that supports the idea that the meteorites found in the strata are indeed from a meteorite impact that occurred around 215 million years ago.

Choice A suggests that the rock was formed after the accumulation layer of the deep seabed in the ancient times exposed above the ground. This does not necessarily support the research findings, as it does not provide any evidence that the rock was formed as a result of a meteorite impact.

Choice B suggests that in the late Paleozoic Triassic (approximately 200 million to 237 million years ago) ammonite and other species were extinct on a large scale. While this may be related to the impact period, it does not necessarily support the research findings, as it does not provide any evidence that the extinction was caused by a meteorite impact.

Choice C suggests that elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface. This supports the research findings, as it provides evidence that the high concentrations of these elements found in the rock are indeed from a meteorite impact.

Choice D suggests that in ancient times, there have been many incidents of meteorite impacting the earth. While this may be true, it does not necessarily support the research findings, as it does not provide any evidence that the meteorites found in the strata are from a specific meteorite impact that occurred around 215 million years ago.

Therefore, the best answer is C: Elements such as iridium and platinum are peculiar to meteorites and usually only exist in trace amounts on the surface.

Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang is that unemployed people will not be able to increase their consumption, even if prices fall to the lowest point.
To weaken Li Ming's rebuttal, we need to find a statement that suggests that unemployed people will have the means to increase their consumption when prices fall to the lowest point.
Choice A suggests that people will buy goods that have been delayed after they are reemployed, but this does not directly address the issue of unemployed people increasing their consumption.
Choice B suggests that consumers still believe that the economic situation will eventually improve, but this does not necessarily mean that unemployed people will have the means to increase their consumption.
Choice C suggests that unemployed people will continue to buy necessities such as food, but this does not necessarily mean that they will increase their consumption beyond necessities.
Choice D suggests that unemployed people will have savings for consumption when prices fall to the lowest point, which directly addresses Li Ming's rebuttal.

If the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household had increased or decreased, the proportion of the cost of buying commercial housing in the average family budget could have remained unchanged even if the average family budget had not increased by 25%.
Therefore, the assumption upon which the discussion relies is that on average, the area of new commercial housing purchased by each household remains unchanged.

If O is performed third, then P must be performed first, because P must be performed at some time before S. Therefore, if O is performed third, then the first two compositions must be P and one of F, H, L, or R.
Since T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and at least two compositions must be performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, T cannot be performed first, second, or third.
Therefore, the possible first, second, and third compositions are:
- If O is performed second: F, H, L, or R; O; P
- If O is performed third: P; F, H, L, or R; O

Now let's check the choices:
A: F, H, P - This is not possible, because O must be performed either second or third.
B: H, P, L - This is not possible, because O must be performed either second or third.
C: O, P, R - This is possible.
D: O, P, T - This is not possible, because T cannot be performed first, second, or third.
E: P, R, T - This is not possible, because O must be performed either second or third.

Therefore, the answer is C: O, P, R.

If S is performed fourth, then O cannot be performed first or fifth, because O must be performed either first or fifth, and there must be at least one composition performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.
If O cannot be performed first, then the first composition must be either F, H, L, P, R, or T.
If T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, then T cannot be performed first.
If P is performed at some time before S, then P cannot be performed fourth. Therefore, P cannot be performed first.
If the eighth composition performed is either L or H, then L and H cannot be performed first.
Therefore, the first composition must be either F or R.
If F is performed first, then T must be performed immediately before F, which is not possible because T cannot be performed first. Therefore, F cannot be performed first.
If R is performed first, then T must be performed immediately after R. But if S is performed fourth, then there must be at least two compositions performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, R cannot be performed first.
Therefore, none of the given choices could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively.
However, since we must select the most likely answer, we can eliminate choices C and D because O cannot be performed first. We can also eliminate choice B because L cannot be performed first. Therefore, the most likely answer is choice A: F, H, P.

* I is placed on the middle shelf
* K is placed on a higher shelf than F

To determine which books could be placed on the bottom shelf, we need to consider the given conditions.

* Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the bottom shelf.

Now let's consider each choice:

* A: F, M - This is possible, but we need to make sure that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
* B: F, H, M - This is possible, but we need to make sure that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.

Now let's consider the remaining choices and the condition that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf:

* A: F, M - If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then there must be at least three books on the top shelf. However, this would mean that there are only two books left for the middle shelf, which is not possible since I is already on the middle shelf. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
* B: F, H, M - If F, H, and M are on the bottom shelf, then there must be at least two books on the top shelf. This would leave three books for the middle shelf, which is possible. Therefore, this choice is possible.

* Since I is placed on the middle shelf, it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
* Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, if F is on the bottom shelf, M must also be on the bottom shelf.

Now let's consider each choice:

* A: F, M - This is possible, but we need to make sure that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
* B: F, H, M - This is possible, but we need to make sure that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
* C: G, H, K - This is not possible, since K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
* D: F, G, M, O - This is not possible, since O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
* E: G, H, L, M - This is not possible, since F and M must be on the same shelf.

Since we need to have more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, let's consider the remaining choices:

* A: F, M - If F and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf can only have one book. This means that the middle shelf must have at least three books, which is not possible since I is already on the middle shelf.
* B: F, H, M - If F, H, and M are on the bottom shelf, then the top shelf can have at most two books. This means that the middle shelf must have at least three books, which is possible.

Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.

The reasoning in the argument is that watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. The answer that weakens this reasoning would be one that suggests that there is another factor that could cause people to overestimate the risks of natural disasters.

Choice A weakens the reasoning by suggesting that many people overestimate the risks of natural disasters regardless of the amount of television they watch. However, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice B weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which could mean that they have less reason to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice C weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice D weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters became informed through means other than watching television. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice E weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television. This could mean that their overestimation of the risks of natural disasters is due to their environment rather than their television viewing habits.

Choice A weakens the reasoning by suggesting that many people overestimate the risks of natural disasters regardless of the amount of television they watch. However, it does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice B weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who watch more television are less likely to live in areas prone to natural disasters, which could mean that they have less reason to overestimate the risks of natural disasters. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice C weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who watch less television have a more accurate idea of the risks of natural disasters. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice D weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who are well informed about the risks of natural disasters became informed through means other than watching television. However, this does not necessarily weaken the argument that watching too much television can lead to an overestimation of risks.

Choice E weakens the reasoning by suggesting that people who live in areas prone to natural disasters are more likely to watch more television. This could mean that their overestimation of the risks of natural disasters is due to their environment rather than their television viewing habits.

Therefore, the answer that most weakens the reasoning is E.

The author suggests that the method obscures the fact that the entire brain is active in both the control condition and the on-task condition, and that the subtractive method produces images that seem to support the modular theory of mind, which the author believes is flawed.

The correct answer is D: The subtractive method seems to strongly support the modular theory of mind because it creates an illusion that brain functions are localized.

The passage discusses the use of brain scans in psychology and the modular theory of mind, which assumes that mental activity can be analyzed into separate modules that are instantiated in localized brain regions. However, the passage also presents a critique of this theory, suggesting that mental processes are likely to be properties of a more general mental activity that is distributed throughout the brain. The passage then explains how functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) works and how it produces images of the brain at work by subtracting a baseline measurement from a measurement taken while the subject is performing a cognitive task. The passage suggests that this subtractive method can create a false impression of neat functional localization by obscuring the fact that the entire brain is active in both conditions.

Based on this information, let's evaluate each of the answer choices:

A: Although there are important exceptions, most cognition does in fact depend on independent modules located in specific regions of the brain.

* This statement contradicts the critique of the modular theory of mind presented in the passage.

B: The modular theory of mind holds that regions of the brain that are not engaged in a specific cognitive task have a rate of oxygen use that is close to zero.

* The passage does not suggest that the modular theory of mind makes this claim.

C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

* This statement is consistent with the explanation of how FMRI works in the passage.

D: The baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method show that some regions of the brain have high metabolic activity at all times,

* The passage does not provide information about the baseline measurements of oxygen use taken for use in the subtractive method.

E: When a brain scan subject experiences anger,the subtractive method shows several regions of the brain as ""lit up"" with metabolic activity.

* The passage does not discuss the specific example of a brain scan subject experiencing anger.

Based on this evaluation, the answer is C: During the performance of certain cognitive tasks, the areas of the brain that are most metabolically active show a rate of oxygen use that is higher than that of the rest of the brain.

The author's primary aim in the passage is to illustrate the often erratic way in which a scientific community achieves progress. The passage describes the discovery of nuclear fission and how it took several years and the work of many scientists to finally understand what was happening. The author emphasizes that even though the evidence was there, scientists were not able to recognize it because they lacked the right conceptual link.

The question asks for a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances.
Primary substances are required for growth and proper functioning and are found in all plants, while secondary substances are a diverse array of chemicals that have no known role in the internal chemical processes of plants' growth or metabolism, but give plants their distinctive tastes and smells.
Choice B describes a set of relationships that is most closely analogous to the relationships between plants and their primary and secondary substances. Mechanical components such as engines and transmissions are necessary for automobiles to run, which is analogous to primary substances being necessary for plants to grow and function properly. Features such as paint and taillights give a car its distinctive look and serve functions such as preventing rust and improving safety, but automobiles can run without them, which is analogous to secondary substances giving plants their distinctive tastes and smells, but not being necessary for their growth or metabolism.

The passage states that Schoenberg's music evolved through three different styles. He began in the late-Romantic manner, then pushed those unstable harmonies until they no longer had a tonal basis, and finally developed the 12-tone technique as a means of bringing a new system of order to nontonal music and stabilizing it. The passage suggests that Schoenberg's progression from the first to the second style was a natural progression, as he pushed the unstable harmonies of the late-Romantic manner until they no longer had a tonal basis. The passage also suggests that the development of the 12-tone technique was a natural progression from the second style, as Schoenberg needed a new system of order to stabilize nontonal music.

The main point of the passage is that stealing thunder is a courtroom strategy that is commonly believed to be effective by lawyers, and this belief is supported by psychological explanations and experimental findings. The passage discusses several reasons why stealing thunder may work, such as creating an image of credibility, providing an impetus for critical assessment, reducing the perceived value of the evidence, and allowing the lawyer to frame the evidence in their own terms. However, the passage also acknowledges that there are limitations to the technique, such as when the information is very damaging or cannot be framed positively.

Choice C accurately expresses the main point of the passage, which is that lawyers' belief in the value of stealing thunder is supported by psychological explanations of how the strategy may influence jurors. The other choices either misrepresent the passage or focus on secondary points.

The passage also states that this technique was not observed in the wild and that the artificial crevices differed from natural crevices and tree holes.

The researchers concluded that the development of this novel technique was due to individual learning, as it was not observed in the wild and was not transmitted socially.

Choice C is the best answer because it supports the researchers' conclusion that the development of the novel technique was due to individual learning. The portion of the technique that deviates from typical tool-using behavior takes place inside a crevice and is therefore difficult for other finches to observe and acquire socially.

Passage 1 is written by Beecher, who argues that women have a subordinate role in society compared to men. However, he also states that this does not mean that women's duties or influence are less important or all-pervading. He believes that women's power and influence should be gained through peaceful and benevolent means, and that women should exert their influence in the domestic and social circle.

The answer choice that best reflects Beecher's point about the status of women relative to that of men is B: Women are inferior to men, but women play a role as significant as that played by men.

The passage discusses Parsons' disillusionment with the idea that government can be used as an instrument to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed. Parsons believes that governments always act in the interest of the few and at the expense of the many, and that they use their power to silence the voice of the minority. Parsons also believes that political parties, once in power, will do anything to remain in power, including crushing opposition and silencing dissent. Therefore, it can be inferred that Parsons thinks positive social change will take place only when vocal individuals compel governments to address their concerns, as this is the only way to overcome the tendency of governments to act in the interest of the few.

The passage discusses the effects of having a large, dominant competitor on smaller brands. The studies in the passage suggest that when consumers are aware of a large competitor's size and close proximity, they are more likely to support the smaller brand, instead of harming it. The passage also mentions that support for a large brand decreases when consumers view it as being in competition with a smaller brand.

In this question, we are asked to predict the likely result if customers of a large chain bookstore were given information focusing on the store's small competitors. Based on the passage, it is likely that customers would view the large chain bookstore as a competitor of the smaller shops, which would decrease their support for the large store.

Therefore, the answer is D: lose customers who would now see it as a competitor of the smaller shops.

To solve the equation, we can first simplify it by canceling out the common factors:
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=x$$
Next, we can multiply both sides by $(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominator:
$$x=x(x-3)$$
$$x=x^{2}-3 x$$
Rearranging the equation to one side gives us:
$$x^{2}-4 x=0$$
Factoring the equation gives us:
$$x(x-4)=0$$
Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $x$ gives us:
$$x=0$$
$$x-4=0$$
$$x=4$$
Therefore, the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $0$ and $4$.
However, we must also check for extraneous solutions by plugging the values back into the original equation.
Plugging in $x=0$ gives us:
$$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2(0)}{2}$$
$$0=0$$
This is a true statement, so $x=0$ is a valid solution.
Plugging in $x=4$ gives us:
$$\frac{4}{4-3}=\frac{2(4)}{2}$$

To solve the equation, we can first simplify it by canceling out the common factors:
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=\frac{2 x}{2}$$
$$\frac{x}{x-3}=x$$
Next, we can multiply both sides by $(x-3)$ to eliminate the denominator:
$$x=x(x-3)$$
$$x=x^{2}-3 x$$
Rearranging the equation to one side gives us:
$$x^{2}-4 x=0$$
Factoring the equation gives us:
$$x(x-4)=0$$
Setting each factor equal to zero and solving for $x$ gives us:
$$x=0$$
$$x-4=0$$
$$x=4$$
Therefore, the possible values of $x$ that satisfy the equation are $0$ and $4$.
However, we must also check for extraneous solutions by plugging the values back into the original equation.
Plugging in $x=0$ gives us:
$$\frac{0}{0-3}=\frac{2(0)}{2}$$
$$0=0$$

To find the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y, we need to find the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream and divide it by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream.

From the table, we can see that 11 people in Group Y recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 68 people in Group Y recalled 5 or more dreams. Therefore, the total number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11 + 68 = 79.

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is 39 + 125 = 164.

Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$.

To solve this problem, I need to simplify the given expression.
First, I will find a common denominator for the two fractions in the denominator of the given expression.
The common denominator is $(x+2)(x+3)$.
Next, I will rewrite the given expression using this common denominator:
$\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x+2}+\frac{1}{x+3}} = \frac{1}{\frac{x+3}{(x+2)(x+3)}+\frac{x+2}{(x+2)(x+3)}} = \frac{1}{\frac{2x+5}{(x+2)(x+3)}}$
Now, I will invert the fraction and multiply by the reciprocal of the denominator:
$\frac{(x+2)(x+3)}{2x+5}$
Finally, I will simplify the expression by distributing the numerator:
$\frac{x^2+5x+6}{2x+5}$
Therefore, the equivalent expression is B: $\frac{x^{2}+5 x+6}{2 x+5}$.

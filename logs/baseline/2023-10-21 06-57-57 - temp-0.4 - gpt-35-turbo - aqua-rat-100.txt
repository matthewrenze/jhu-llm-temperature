  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the total number of staplers produced that day. Let's call this number "x".
The number of defective staplers produced is 10% of x, or 0.1x.
The number of non-defective staplers produced is 90% of x, or 0.9x.
Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected, or 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up the following equation:
0.018x = 72
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4000
Therefore, the number of staplers produced that day was 4,000.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96, and A and B are independent. 

We can use the formula: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substituting the values we know, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying, we get: 

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 1:
Let P(B) = x. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6x. We know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + x - 0.6x = 0.96. Solving for x, we get x = 0.8. Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.8.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs, which is P(neither A nor B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).
We know that P(neither A nor B) = 1 - 0.96 = 0.04.
So, (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) = 0.04.
Substituting P(A) = 0.6, we get:
(1 - 0.6) * (1 - P(B)) = 0.04
0.4 * (1 - P(B)) = 0.04
1 - P(B) = 0.1
P(B) = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96, and A and B are independent. 

We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve for P(B):

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 - 0.2P(B)
0.36 = -0.2P(B)
P(B) = -0.36/-0.2 = 1.8

Since a probability cannot be greater than 1, we know that there must be an error in our calculations. 

The mistake is that we assumed A and B are independent, but we were not given any information about the probability of A and B occurring together. 

Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A U B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B). 

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(B): 

P(B) = (P(A U B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A n B)) 

We don't know P(A n B), but we do know that it is less than or equal to P(A), since if A occurs, then both A and B occur. So we can use the upper bound of P(A) for P(A n B):

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.6 + 0.4P(B).
We know that P(A or B) = 0.96.
So, 0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B).
Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.9.
Therefore, the answer is: Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - P(A and B)

We also know that since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

Substituting P(A) = 0.6, we get:

P(A and B) = 0.6 * P(B)

Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)

Simplifying, we get:

0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)

Dividing both sides by 0.4, we get:

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

We can rearrange this equation to solve for P(B): 

P(B) = (P(A or B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A and B)) 

We don't know P(A and B), but we can use the fact that A and B are independent to say that P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). 

So, 

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6 * P(B)) 

Simplifying, 

0.4 = 0.4 * P(B) 

P(B) = 1 

So the probability that event B occurs is 1, or 100%. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that:

P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B), so we can substitute:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Solving for P(B), we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is (E) 0.9.
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96, and A and B are independent. 

We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve for P(B):
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 - 0.6 = -0.2P(B)
0.36 = -0.2P(B)
P(B) = -0.36/-0.2 = 1.8

Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, this answer is not valid. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". However, the most likely answer is (D) 0.8, which would have been the correct answer if the events were dependent.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's start with the number of white golf balls that the store had. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we can assume that the number of white golf balls sold is equal to the initial number of white golf balls in stock. 

Let's call the initial number of yellow golf balls "y". Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls sold is also "y". 

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory, so the total number of golf balls sold is 0.8(600) = 480. 

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is also "w" = y. 

So we have the equation:

y + y = 480

Simplifying, we get:

2y = 480

y = 240

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls the store sold. If the store sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since it sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and it sold all of its white golf balls, then it must have sold 240 white golf balls. That means it started the day with 360 yellow golf balls (600 total golf balls - 240 white golf balls sold).

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 

Action: Answer("E")  

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60. So, 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours. 

Next, we need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. 

His normal speed is 15 mph, but on a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. 

Action: Answer("C")  

So, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

Finally, we can use the formula: 

distance = speed x time 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours 

distance = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth) 

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.
Response 2:
First, we need to convert the time to hours. 21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60). 

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in one hour. Therefore, in 0.35 hours, he can travel 15 x 0.35 = 5.25 miles. 

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is now 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

Using the formula distance = rate x time, we can calculate how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes: distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles. 

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Response 6:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 mph * 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles in 21 minutes.

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

On a windy day, Bill can travel 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles in 21 minutes.

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets. 

Action: Answer("3:4")

This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

We also know that there are 120 green sweets. 

To find the number of red sweets, we can set up a proportion: 

3/4 = x/120 

where x is the number of red sweets. 

Solving for x: 

x = (3/4) * 120 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the total number of sweets in the bag. 

Action: Answer("D") 

To get the answer, we need to use the ratio to find the number of red sweets. We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. 

We are given that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. We can use this information to find the number of red sweets as follows: 

3/4 = x/120 

where x is the number of red sweets. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3 * 120 

4x = 360 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag. 

So, the answer is A: 90.
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets and the given number of green sweets to find the number of red sweets. 

Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of a fraction. 

The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means that out of every 7 sweets (3 + 4), 3 are red and 4 are green. So the fraction of red sweets to total sweets is 3/7. 

We know that the bag contains 120 green sweets, so we can set up a proportion: 

3/7 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

7x = 3 * 120
x = 360/7

This is not one of the answer choices, so we need to round to the nearest whole number: 

x ≈ 51

Therefore, there are approximately 51 red sweets in the bag. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of the number of green sweets. 

Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, we can write this as:

3/4 = x/120

where x is the number of red sweets. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3 * 120
4x = 360
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we need to use the ratio between red and green sweets. For every 4 green sweets, there are 3 red sweets. So, if there are 120 green sweets, we can calculate the number of red sweets as follows:

120 green sweets / 4 green sweets per 3 red sweets = 90 red sweets

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can start by using the ratio of red sweets to green sweets to find the total number of parts. Since the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, there are 3 + 4 = 7 parts in total. 

Next, we can use the fact that there are 120 green sweets to find the size of one part. If 4 parts represent 120 green sweets, then one part represents 120/4 = 30 green sweets. 

Finally, we can use the size of one part to find the number of red sweets. Since one part represents both 3 red sweets and 4 green sweets, the number of red sweets is (3/4) * 30 = 22.5. However, we can't have half a sweet, so we round up to the nearest whole number. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") 90
Response 8:
To solve the problem, we need to use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets, which is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. We also know that there are 120 green sweets. 

To find the number of red sweets, we can set up a proportion:

3/4 = x/120

where x is the number of red sweets we want to find.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

4x = 3 * 120
4x = 360
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We can start by using the ratio of red sweets to green sweets to find the total number of sweets in the bag. Let x be the number of red sweets. Then the ratio of red sweets to green sweets can be expressed as:

3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

4x = 3 * 120
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost of the company:
Yearly production cost = 420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of at least $626,400, the yearly revenue from sales should be:
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit = $554,400 + $626,400 = $1,180,800

The minimum selling price per component can be calculated as follows:
Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Total units produced per year
Total units produced per year = 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / 5,040 units/year = $234/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.

Response 7:
Let's start by calculating the yearly production cost: 

420 units/month * $110/unit * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

To make a profit of $626,400/year, the revenue from sales needs to be:

$626,400/year + $554,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum selling price per component, we can use the following formula:

selling price = (total revenue) / (number of units)

number of units = 420 units/month * 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year

total revenue = $1,180,800/year

selling price = $1,180,800/year / 5,040 units/year = $234/unit

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a profit of at least $626,400/year is $234.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let P be the selling price per component. 
The revenue from selling one component is P dollars.
The profit from selling one component is (P-110) dollars.
The profit from selling 420 components is 420(P-110) dollars.
The yearly profit is 12*420(P-110) = 5040(P-110) dollars.
We want 5040(P-110) >= 626400.
Simplifying the inequality gives P >= 230.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component is $230.

Response 0:

Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can solve this problem by using the formula for the sum of consecutive integers: sum = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference between terms. In this case, we know that the sum is 51, the first term is -50, and the terms are consecutive, so the common difference is 1. Substituting these values, we get:

51 = (k/2)(-99 + (k-1)(1))

Simplifying this equation, we get:

51 = (k/2)(k-100)

Multiplying both sides by 2 and rearranging, we get:

k^2 - 100k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get:

k = (100 ± sqrt(100^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2
k = (100 ± sqrt(9604)) / 2
k = (100 ± 98) / 2

We reject the negative solution, so we get:

k = (100 + 98) / 2
k = 98 / 2
k = 49

Therefore, the answer is:

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?

  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's start by using the information given to find the width of the rectangular parking space. Let's call the width "w". 

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so: 

2w + 9 = 37 

Solving for w: 

2w = 28 

w = 14 

So the width of the parking space is 14 feet. 

To find the area of the parking space, we multiply the length and width: 

Area = length x width 

Area = 9 x 14 

Area = 126 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126.

Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can start by using the information given to set up two equations. Let's call the length of the painted side x and the width of the rectangle y. 

From the problem, we know that:
- 2x + y = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
- y = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

We can substitute y = 9 into the first equation to get:
2x + 9 = 37
2x = 28
x = 14

Now we know that one painted side is 14 feet long. We can use this information to find the width of the rectangle:
2(14) + y = 37
y = 9

So the rectangle is 14 feet by 9 feet, and the area is:
14 * 9 = 126 square feet

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126.

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then, the share of each daughter is 4x and the share of each son is 5x. 

The total number of people who receive a share is 5+4+2=11. 

Therefore, 

5x + 4x + 2x = 8600 

11x = 8600 

x = 780 

So, each nephew receives Rs 780. 

Each daughter receives 4 times as much as each nephew, which is 4*780 = Rs 3120. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x. Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x.
The total number of people receiving the money is 5+4+2 = 11.
So, 5x + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
Solving the above equation, we get x = 400.
So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(400) = Rs 1600.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, let's find out the total number of people who are going to receive the money.
5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11
Now, let's find out how much each nephew will receive.
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Then, each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x.
So, the total amount distributed will be:
2x + 4(4x) + 5(5x) = 86,00
Solving this equation, we get x = 200.
So, each daughter will receive 4x = Rs 800.

Therefore, the answer is E: Rs 800.

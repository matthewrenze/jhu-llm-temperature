Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we need to use the formula: Total = Defective + Non-defective

Let x be the total number of staplers produced on Monday.
Then, the number of defective staplers is 0.1x (10% of the total).
The number of non-defective staplers is 0.9x (90% of the total).

Out of the non-defective staplers, 2% were rejected by mistake, which is 0.02(0.9x) = 0.018x.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation:
0.018x = 72

Solving for x, we get:
x = 4,000

Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, we can find the total number of defective staplers by multiplying the total number of staplers produced by 10%. Then, we can find the number of non-defective staplers by subtracting the number of defective staplers from the total number of staplers. Finally, we can find the number of rejected staplers by multiplying the number of non-defective staplers by 2%. We can set up an equation to solve for the total number of staplers produced: 

0.02x = 72, where x is the total number of non-defective staplers produced. 

Solving for x, we get:

x = 72 / 0.02 = 3600 

The total number of staplers produced is the sum of the number of defective staplers and the number of non-defective staplers: 

Total = (0.10)(3600) + 3600 = 3960 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") 4200.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's start by setting up an equation to represent the information given. Let x be the number of staplers produced that day. 

The number of defective staplers produced is 10% of x, which is 0.1x. 

Out of the remaining non-defective staplers, 2% are rejected. This means that 98% are accepted, or (0.98)(x - 0.1x) = (0.98)(0.9x) = 0.882x are accepted. 

We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation: 

0.02(x - 0.1x) = 72 

Simplifying: 

0.02(0.9x) = 72 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

So the answer is (A) 4,000.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
Thus, 0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
Solving for P(B), we get P(B) = 0.8

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve for P(B):
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.  
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by:  
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)  
Thus, we have:  
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)  
0.36 = 0.4P(B)  
P(B) = 0.9  

Therefore, the answer is:  
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 
Since A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs: P(A or B) = 1 - P(neither A nor B).
Since A and B are independent, neither A nor B occurs if and only if neither A nor B occurs. That is, P(neither A nor B) = P(not A) * P(not B) = (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)).
Therefore, we have:
P(A or B) = 1 - P(not A) * P(not B)
0.96 = 1 - (1 - 0.6) * (1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - 0.4 * (1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4 * P(B)
0.4 * P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the same as 1 - the probability that neither A nor B occurs, so:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.96
Substituting P(A) = 0.6:
0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) = 0.96
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since the events A and B are independent, the probability that both events occur is P(A) * P(B). The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the events minus the probability that both events occur, which is P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B). We know that this probability is 0.96, so we can set up the equation:

P(A) + P(B) - P(A) * P(B) = 0.96

Substituting P(A) = 0.6, we get:

0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B) = 0.96

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.4 + 0.4 * P(B) = 0.96

0.4 * P(B) = 0.56

P(B) = 0.56 / 0.4 = 1.4

Since the probability of an event cannot be greater than 1, this answer is not possible. Therefore, the correct answer is None of the Above.
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 
Since events A and B are independent, we have:
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs can be expressed as:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

We are given that:
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Substituting the expressions for P(A or B) and P(A and B) into the formula for P(A or B), we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying and solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.8

Therefore, the answer is: 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let P(B) = x
We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A U B) = 0.96, where U stands for Union.
P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) [Theorem of Probability]
We also know that A and B are independent. Therefore, P(A ∩ B) = P(A)P(B)
Substituting the values, we get:
0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6x)
Solving the equation, we get:
x = 0.7
Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.7.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B). 

Given that at least one of the events A or B occurs, we know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 

We can substitute the expressions for P(A and B) and P(A or B) to get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) 

Simplifying the expression: 

0.36 = 0.4P(B) 

P(B) = 0.9 

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 9:
Let's use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) where A and B are independent events. We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. We can rearrange the formula to solve for P(B):
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 x P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 x P(B)
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 21 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
Response 0:
Let's denote Meenu's weight with x. 
From the statement, we know: x=29+(1/2)x
Simplifying the equation:
(1/2)x=29
Multiplying both sides of the equation by 2, we get:
x=58

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's start by simplifying the information given. 
Meenu weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight, which can be written as 29 + (1/2)W = (2*29+W)/2 + W/2 = (58+W)/2
We can now set up an equation to solve for W:
Silu's weight + Meenu's weight = Total weight
51 + W = (58+W)/2 + W/2
Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:
102 + 2W = 58 + W + W/2
Simplifying and solving for W, we get:
W = 27

Therefore, Meenu weighs 27 Kgs. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be x.
Then, according to the problem, she weighs "29 Kgs plus half of her weight".
So, we can write an equation as:
x = 29 + 0.5x
Solving for x, we get:
0.5x = 29
x = 29 * 2
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's denote Meenu's weight as x. 
Then, from the information provided in the problem, we can write the equation: x = 29 + 0.5x
Simplifying this equation, we get 0.5x = 29, which implies x = 58.
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's first represent Meenu's weight as 'M'. According to the given information, we can set up the following equation: M = 29 + 0.5M. Solving for M, we get M = 58.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem:
Let x be the length of the longer piece.
Then, the length of the shorter piece is x - 3.
The two pieces add up to 20 meters, so we can create the following equation:
x + (x-3) = 20
Simplifying and solving for x we get:
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5
Therefore, the length of the longer piece is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. Since the total length of the rope is 20 meters, we can write an equation: 

x + (x - 3) = 20 

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

2x - 3 = 20 

Adding 3 to both sides, we get: 

2x = 23 

Dividing both sides by 2, we get: 

x = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters. 

Action: Answer("D")

Simplifying the equation, we get:
2x - 3 = 20
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
2x = 23
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 11.5

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
First, we need to convert the time into hours: 21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours (21/60). Then, we can calculate the distance using the formula: distance = rate x time. 

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. So, the distance he can travel in 0.35 hours is:

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we first need to convert the time to hours:
21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

On a normal day, Bill can travel:
15 mph * 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed would be:
15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

On a windy day, Bill can travel:
11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")  3.85 miles
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
First we need to calculate Bill's speed on a windy day. 

We know that his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day is:

15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph

Now we need to calculate how far he can travel in 21 minutes (which is 0.35 hours). We can use the formula:

distance = speed x time

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours

distance = 3.85 miles

So Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.

Response 6:
First, we need to convert the time into hours. 21 minutes is equal to 0.35 hours. 

On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

We can use the formula distance = speed * time to find the distance Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes.

distance = 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can follow the formula Distance = Rate x Time. 
On a normal day, Bill travels 15 mph. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed is now 15 - 4 = 11 mph. We are given the time as 21 minutes, so we need to convert it to hours by dividing by 60: 21/60 = 0.35 hours. Now we can use the formula to find the distance: Distance = Rate x Time = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We can start by calculating the distance Bill can travel in one minute when his speed is reduced by 4 mph. If he normally averages 15 mph, his speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

To find out how far he can travel in one minute, we can divide his speed by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour): 

11 mph ÷ 60 = 0.1833 miles per minute

To find out how far he can travel in 21 minutes, we can multiply his speed by the number of minutes: 

0.1833 miles per minute x 21 minutes = 3.85 miles

So Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21/60 = 0.35 hours.
On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.
The distance he can travel is calculated as:
distance = speed x time
distance = 11 x 0.35
distance ≈ 3.85 miles

Response 2:
Solution: 

Let the number of red sweets be 3x, then the number of green sweets will be 4x. 

We know that 4x = 120, therefore x = 30. 

So the number of red sweets is 3x = 3(30) = 90.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's first calculate how many green sweets there would be for every one red sweet: 

  4 parts (green) / 3 parts (red) = 120 (green) / x (red) 

Cross-multiplying these ratios, we get: 

  4x = 3 * 120 

  4x = 360 

  x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Solution:

Let's start by using the ratio to find the number of red sweets in the bag:

3/4 = x/120

where x is the number of red sweets in the bag.

We can cross-multiply to solve for x:

4x = 3 * 120
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let the minimum selling price per component be x.
Then, the revenue from selling one component is x dollars and the profit from selling one component is (x - 110) dollars.
In a year (12 months), the number of components produced and sold is 420 * 12 = 5040.
Therefore, the yearly revenue is 5040x dollars and the yearly profit is 5040(x - 110) dollars.
We want the yearly profit to be at least $626,400.
So, we have the inequality:
5040(x - 110) >= 626400
Dividing both sides by 5040, we get:
x - 110 >= 124
x >= 234
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution: 

The yearly production cost for 420 units every month is 420 x $110 x 12 = $554,400. 

To make a profit of $626,400 a year, the total revenue from selling the components must be at least $1,180,800 ($554,400 production cost + $626,400 profit). 

Total number of components produced in a year is 420 x 12 = 5,040. 

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component to achieve the required revenue is $1,180,800 / 5,040 = $234.13, which is closest to $240 (choice C).
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, we need to find the total production cost for 420 units per month:
> 420 x $110 = $46,200

To calculate the minimum selling price per component, we need to find the total revenue required to achieve a yearly profit of $626,400:
> Yearly profit = 12 x Monthly profit
> $626,400 = 12 x (Revenue - Production cost)
> $626,400 = 12 x (Revenue - $46,200)
> $626,400 = 12 x Revenue - $554,400
> 12 x Revenue = $626,400 + $554,400
> 12 x Revenue = $1,180,800
> Revenue = $1,180,800 / 12
> Revenue = $98,400

Now we can find the minimum selling price per component:
> $98,400 / 420 = $234.29

Rounding up to the nearest dollar, we get a minimum selling price of $235. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")

The closest answer is option B ($230), but the correct answer is actually slightly higher at $235.
Response 5:
Let x be the selling price per component in dollars. The revenue from selling 420 components in a month is 420x dollars. Thus, the total revenue in a year is 12*420x = 5040x. The total production cost in a year is 12*420*110 = 554400 dollars. The profit in a year is the revenue minus the production cost, which is 5040x - 554400 dollars. To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400, we need to solve the inequality 5040x - 554400 >= 626400, which simplifies to 5040x >= 1180800, and then x >= 234.545. The smallest integer greater than or equal to 234.545 is 235. Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $235. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
To find the selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit, we need to first calculate the total cost and total revenue for the year. 

Total cost = 420 x 12 x 110 = $554,400 

Let's assume that the selling price per component is x. 

Total revenue = 420 x 12 x x 

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost 

We want the profit to be at least $626,400. Hence we can write, 

420 x 12 x x - 554,400 >= 626,400 

5040x >= 1,180,800 

x >= 234.13 

The minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit will be $235 (rounded to the nearest dollar). 

So, the answer is not given in the choices. Hence, the closest answer is choice B: 230.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First, we need to calculate the yearly revenue by multiplying the monthly revenue by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year):
420 units/month x SP = monthly revenue
420 units/month x SP x 12 = yearly revenue
Next, we need to calculate the yearly production cost:
420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 = $554,400
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we need to set up the equation:
yearly revenue - yearly production cost = yearly profit
420 units/month x SP x 12 - $554,400 = $626,400
Simplifying the equation:
5,040SP = $1,180,800
SP = $234
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $234.

Question: A cyclist travels at 12 miles per hour. How many minutes will it take to travel 48 miles?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula: time = distance / speed. 

Action: Answer("E") 

We have:
distance = 48 miles
speed = 12 miles per hour

Substituting these values in the formula, we get:
time = 48 / 12
time = 4 hours

Since we want the answer in minutes, we need to convert 4 hours to minutes:
4 hours * 60 minutes per hour = 240 minutes

Therefore, it will take 240 minutes for the cyclist to travel 48 miles at a speed of 12 miles per hour.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can solve this problem using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(2a + (n-1)d), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and d is the common difference.

In this case, we know that the sum of k consecutive integers is 51, so we can write:

51 = (k/2)(-50 + (-50 + (k-1)))

Simplifying this expression, we get:

51 = (k/2)(-100 + k)

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction, we get:

102 = k(-100 + k)

Expanding the right side, we get:

102 = -k^2 + 100k

Rearranging and factoring, we get:

k^2 - 100k + 102 = 0
(k - 2)(k - 98) = 0

Therefore, k = 2 or k = 98. We can eliminate k = 2 because we know that the sum of two consecutive integers is always even, and 51 is odd. Therefore, the answer is:

Response 5:

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can solve this problem by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence:
sum = (number of terms / 2) * (first term + last term)

Since the least integer is -50, the first term of the sequence is -50, and the last term is -50 + k - 1 = -51 + k.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
51 = (k / 2) * (-50 + (-51 + k))

Simplifying the equation, we get:
102 = k * (-101 + k)

Expanding the right side of the equation, we get:
102 = -101k + k^2

Rearranging the terms, we get:
k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

Factoring the left side of the equation, we get:
(k - 1)(k - 100) = 0

Therefore, the possible values of k are k = 1 and k = 100. However, since we are looking for the sum of consecutive integers that is equal to 51, we can eliminate the solution k = 100 because the sum of the first 100 integers is much greater than 51. Therefore, the only possible value of k is k = 1.

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
We can start the problem by using the information given to us to form a system of equations. Let's call the length of the painted sides l and w for length and width, respectively. Then we have:

2l + w = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
w = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)

We can use the second equation to substitute for w in the first equation:

2l + 9 = 37
2l = 28
l = 14

Now we know that the length of the rectangle is 14 feet. We can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the area:

A = lw = 14(9) = 126

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangular parking space. 

We know that:
- Two widths and one length are painted, so the length of the unpainted side is W = 9 ft.
- The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 2L + W = 37 ft.

Solving for L, we get:
L = (37 - W)/2
L = (37 - 9)/2
L = 14 ft

The area of the parking space is:
A = L x W
A = 14 ft x 9 ft
A = 126 square feet

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's call the length of the parking space l and the width w.
From the problem, we know that:
2w + l = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
l = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)
We can use these equations to solve for w:
2w + 9 = 37
2w = 28
w = 14
Now we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle to find the area of the parking space:
A = lw = 14 * 9 = 126
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
First, we can start by using the given information to set up an equation. Let L be the length of the parking space and W be the width. We know that the perimeter of the painted sides is 37, so we have:

2L + W = 37

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9, so we have:

L + W = 28

Now we can solve for L and W by subtracting the second equation from twice the first equation:

(2L + W) - 2(L + W) = 37 - 2(28)

L = 9

Substituting this value of L back into the second equation, we get:

9 + W = 28

W = 19

So the width of the parking space is 19 feet. The area of the parking space is then:

A = L * W = 9 * 19 = 171 square feet

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
First, we can use the given information to find the perimeter of the parking space:
Perimeter = sum of painted sides + length of unpainted side
Perimeter = 37 + 9
Perimeter = 46 feet

Let L be the length of the parking space and w be the width of the parking space.
Then, we have two equations:
2L + w = 46 (since the sum of two lengths and one width is equal to the perimeter)
L + 2w = area (since the area of a rectangle is length times width)

Solving for L in the first equation, we get L = 23 - 0.5w
Substituting this into the second equation, we get:
23w - 0.5w^2 = area

To maximize the area, we need to find the vertex of the parabola given by the equation above. The x-coordinate of the vertex is given by -b/2a, where a = -0.5 and b = 23:
w = -b/2a = -23/(-1) = 23

Substituting w = 23 back into the equation for the area, we get:
area = 23(23) - 0.5(23)^2 = 529 - 264.5 = 264.5

Therefore, the area of the parking space is approximately 264.5 square feet.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
First, we need to find the length of the two painted sides. Let's call the length of the shorter painted side "x" and the length of the longer painted side "y". 

We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so:

x + y + 9 = 37 

x + y = 28 

We also know that the area of a rectangle is length times width, so:

Area = xy 

We need to find the value of xy. We can use the information we have to set up an equation that relates xy to x and y:

y = 28 - x 

Substitute this into the equation for the area:

Area = x(28 - x) 

Now we can maximize the area by finding the vertex of the parabola that represents this equation. The x-coordinate of the vertex is:

x = -b/2a

where a = -1 and b = 28. 

x = -28/2(-1) = 14 

So the maximum area occurs when x = 14. 

Substitute this value back into the equation for the area:

Area = x(28 - x) = 14(28 - 14) = 196 

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 196 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let the length of the parking space be x and the width be y. We know that x + 2y = 37 (the sum of the painted sides) and y = 9 (the length of the unpainted side). Solving for x, we get x = 19. Substituting x = 19 and y = 9 into the formula for the area of a rectangle (A = xy), we get A = 19 * 9 = 171. 

Action: Answer("E")  (None of the above option is missing)
Response 8:
Let L be the length and W be the width of the rectangular parking space.
From the problem statement, we have:
2L + W = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
W = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)
Solving for L, we get:
L = (37 - 9) / 2 = 14
Therefore, the area of the rectangular parking space is:
A = L * W = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet.

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B") 
Explanation: 
Let's assume that the number of copper coins that she brought is "x", and the number of brass coins that she brought is "y". 
From the problem, we know that:
- She gets 20 cents for each copper coin. So, the total amount of money that she gets for copper coins is 20x.
- She gets 25 cents for each brass coin. So, the total amount of money that she gets for brass coins is 25y.
- The total amount of money that she got from the dive is $3.40. So, we can write this equation: 20x + 25y = 340 (in cents)
We need to find the minimum value of x that satisfies this equation. 
Let's try x = 1:
- If x = 1, then 20 + 25y = 340
- Solving for y, we get y = 12
- This means that she brought 1 copper coin and 12 brass coins
- The total amount of money that she gets is 20 + 25(12) = $3.20, which is not equal to $3.40
Let's try x = 2:
- If x = 2, then 40 + 25y = 340
- Solving for y, we get y = 12
- This means that she brought 2 copper coins and 12 brass coins
- The total amount of money that she gets is 40 + 25(12) = $3.40, which is the correct answer.
Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 2. Answer: B.

Let the cost price of the article be x, then the selling price of the article would be (120/100)*x = 6x/5. We know that the selling price is Rs.360, so we can set up the equation 6x/5 = 360 and solve for x. 

Action: Answer("A") 270.

6x/5 = 360
6x = 1800
x = 300

Therefore, the cost price of the article is Rs.270.

The selling price of 1 kg of orange = Rs. 7.50  
The selling price of 90 kg of orange = 90 x 7.50 = Rs. 675  
Gain = Selling price - Cost price  
Gain = 675 - 450 = 225  
Percentage gain = (Gain / Cost price) x 100  
Percentage gain = (225 / 450) x 100 = 50 %  
Therefore, the merchant gained 50% from the transaction.

Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let the amount that each nephew gets be x. Then each daughter gets 4x and each son gets 5x.
Total number of people receiving the amount = 5+4+2 = 11
Total amount = Rs 8600
Using the given information, we can write the following equation:
5x + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
Simplifying this equation, we get:
23x = 8600
x = 8600/23

Therefore, each daughter gets 4x = 4*(8600/23) which is approximately equal to  Rs 1765.22

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Let the amount that each nephew receives be x.
Then, the amount that each daughter receives = 4x.
And, the amount that each son receives = 5x.

Total number of recipients = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Total amount = Rs 8600

So, we have: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600

Simplifying the above equation, we get:

31x = 8600

x = 278.71 (approx)

Therefore, the amount that each nephew receives = Rs 278.71

And, the amount that each daughter receives = 4x = Rs 1114.84 (approx)

Thus, the answer is: Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, let's find the total number of people who will receive a share of the money: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11 people

Let the amount each nephew receives be x.

Amount received by each daughter = 4x

Amount received by each son = 5x

Total amount received by 11 people = 8600

So, 5x (amount received by each son) + 4(4x) (amount received by each daughter) + 2x (amount received by each nephew) = 8600

Simplifying the equation, we get:

23x = 8600

x = 374.78 (rounded off to two decimal places)

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4*374.78 = Rs 1499.12 (rounded off to two decimal places)

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

(Note: The correct answer is not one of the given choices)
Response 6:
Let the amount that each nephew receives be x. Then, each son receives 5x and each daughter receives 4x. 

The total number of recipients is 5 + 4 + 2 = 11. So we can set up the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600 

Simplifying: 

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 

43x = 8600 

x = 200 

So each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x
Amount each daughter receives = 4x
Amount each son receives = 5x
Total number of parts = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Sum amount = 8600
Therefore, each part = 8600/11 =  782.73 approx
Amount each daughter receives = 4x = 4 * 782.73 =  Answer("E") = Rs 3130.92 (approx)
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's first calculate the total number of people who receive the money: 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11. 

Let X be the amount each nephew receives. 

Each son receives 5X and each daughter receives 4 * X. 

So the total amount of money distributed is: 
5(5X) + 4(4X) + 2(X) = 25X + 16X + 2X = 43X 

We know that the total amount distributed is Rs 8600. So: 
43X = 8600 

Solving for X, we get: 
X = 200 

So each daughter receives 4X = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

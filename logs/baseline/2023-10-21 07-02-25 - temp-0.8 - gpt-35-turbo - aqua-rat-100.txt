We can use proportions to solve this problem. Let x be the height of the tree. Then we have:

(height of the pole)/(length of its shadow) = (height of the tree)/(length of its shadow)

Plugging in the values we get:

14/10 = x/15

Solving for x, we get:

x = 21

So the height of the tree is 21 meters.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B). 

The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is the complement of the probability that neither A nor B occurs, which is (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B)) = 0.4 * (1 - P(B)). So we have:

P(A or B) = 1 - (1 - P(A)) * (1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - (1 - 0.6) * (1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - 0.4(1 - P(B))
0.96 = 1 - 0.4 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Since events A and B are independent, we have P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B). 

We know that P(A) = 0.6. We also know that the probability of at least one of the events A or B occurring is 0.96. This means that the probability of neither A nor B occurring is 1 - 0.96 = 0.04. Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we have:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Since A and B are independent events, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)
Therefore, we have:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.8
So the answer is: Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A U B) = 0.96 (where U means union or "or"), and that events A and B are independent.
We can use the formula P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) (where ∩ means intersection or "and") to solve for P(B).
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4 = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B.
Then, based on the problem, we know that:
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96
Since A and B are independent, we know that:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B):
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.9
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. 

We know that: 
P(A) = 0.6 
P(A or B) = 0.96 

Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two independent events: 

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

We can rearrange this to solve for P(B): 

P(B) = (P(A or B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A and B)) 

Substituting in the values we know, we get: 

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9 

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9
Response 6:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.96 since at least one of the events must occur. 

Since A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6 * P(B). 

Therefore, we have: 
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

0.4P(B) = 0.36

P(B) = 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's start by using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B) for independent events.

Given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, we can say:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 - 0.2P(B) + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.2P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.2 

Action: Answer("C")  # Therefore, the probability of event B occurring is 0.7.
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is given by P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Since events A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) x P(B), thus we have:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 x P(B)
Solving for P(B), we get:
P(B) = 0.4 / 0.4 = 1

Therefore, the answer is not among the choices. Please double-check the question and the choices.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. 

Since the number of yellow and white golf balls sold is equal, the number of white golf balls at the beginning of the day is also x. 

The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is x + x = 2x. 

After selling 80% of its inventory, the store had 20% of its inventory left. 

So 0.2(2x) = 0.4x yellow golf balls were left. 

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of yellow golf balls left is equal to the total number of golf balls left, which is 0.4x. 

We know that the number of yellow golf balls left is equal to the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day, which is x. 

Therefore, 0.4x = x, and x = 400. 

So the store had 400 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's call the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin with "Y". Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 1/2 of the total number of golf balls. 

The total number of golf balls the store had is 600, since that's what it started with. 

If the store sold 80% of the golf balls, it has 20% left. 

We know that the store sold all of its white golf balls, so the remaining golf balls must be yellow. 

To find the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin with, we can set up the following equation: 

0.20(600) = Y

Solving for Y: 

Y = 120 

Therefore, the store had 120 yellow golf balls to begin with. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's use algebra to solve the problem. 
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. 
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls and sold all of its white golf balls, then the number of white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is also x. 
The total number of golf balls in stock is 600, so we can write an equation: 

x + x = 600 

Simplifying this equation: 

2x = 600 

x = 300 

Therefore, the store had 300 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the initial inventory of yellow golf balls be denoted by Y. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it initially had Y white golf balls in stock as well. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, the number of white golf balls sold is also equal to Y. 

We know that the store started with a total inventory of 600 golf balls and sold 80% of them. This means that the store sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since half of these were yellow golf balls, we know that the store sold 240 yellow golf balls.

Since the store started with Y yellow golf balls, we can set up an equation to solve for Y:
Y - 240 = Y/2
Solving for Y, we get Y = 480.

Therefore, the store initially had 480 yellow golf balls in stock. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Let y be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.
The number of white golf balls at the beginning of the day is also y.
The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is y + y = 2y.
The store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, which means it sold 80/100 * 600 = 480 golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 480/2 = 240 yellow golf balls.
The store sold all of its white golf balls, which means it had 0 white golf balls left at the end of the day.
Therefore, the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is 2y - 240 = 600 - 480 = 120.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's first find out how many golf balls the store sold during the day. Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it sold 240 of each. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it must have had 240 white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. Therefore, the store had 600 - 240 = 360 yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let y be the number of yellow golf balls and w be the number of white golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we know w = 0 at the end of the day. We also know that y + w = 600 at the start of the day, and 80% of this total is sold: 0.8(y + w) = 0.8(600) = 480. Since the same number of yellow and white golf balls are sold, we know that 0.4y = 480, which implies y = 1200/4 = 300.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, it had x white golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day. Since it sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls, the store sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, it sold x white golf balls. Thus, it sold x yellow golf balls. In total, the store sold x white golf balls + x yellow golf balls = 2x golf balls. Thus, we have 2x = 480, which implies that x = 240.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.
The number of white golf balls is also x, since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls.
The total number of golf balls at the beginning of the day is 2x.
The store sold 80% of its inventory, so it sold 0.8(2x) = 1.6x golf balls.
The store sold all of its white golf balls, which means it sold x white golf balls.
Therefore, the store sold 1.6x - x = 0.6x yellow golf balls.
Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, there were no white golf balls left at the end of the day. This means that the number of yellow golf balls remaining must be equal to the total number of golf balls remaining, which is 0.2(2x) = 0.4x.
Therefore, we have:
0.4x = 0
x = 240

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let W be the number of white golf balls and Y be the number of yellow golf balls. We know that W+Y=600. 

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, we can conclude that the number of white golf balls sold is W. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow golf balls, we can conclude that the number of yellow golf balls sold is also W. 

Since the store sold 80% of its inventory, this means that 0.8(600) = 480 golf balls were sold. Since the store sold W white golf balls and W yellow golf balls, we can conclude that 2W = 480, which means that W = 240. 

Therefore, the initial number of yellow golf balls (Y) must be 600 - 240 = 360.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. The length of the other piece is then (x-3). We know that both pieces add up to 20 meters: x + (x-3) = 20. Solving for x, we get x = 11.5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope in meters. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x - 3) meters. Since the sum of the two lengths is 20 meters, we have the equation:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying and solving for x, we get:
2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let x be the length of the longer piece, then the length of the other piece is x - 3. The sum of the lengths of the two pieces equals the length of the rope which is 20 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation: x + (x - 3) = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 11.5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let x be the length of the shorter piece, then the length of the longer piece is x+3. The sum of the lengths is 20, so x + (x+3) = 20. Solving for x gives x = 8.5. Therefore, the length of the longer piece is x+3 = 8.5+3 = 11.5, thus the answer is (D) 11.5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
The length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
The total length of the rope is 20 meters.
Therefore, x + (x-3) = 20.
Simplifying the equation: 2x -3 = 20.
Adding 3 to both sides: 2x = 23.
Dividing by 2 on both sides: x = 11.5.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let the length of the longer piece of rope be x. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x-3. The sum of the two lengths is 20. Thus, we can write the equation x + (x-3) = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 11.5. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let X be the length of the longer piece of rope in meters. 

From the problem, we know that the length of the shorter piece of rope is X - 3. 

We also know that the sum of the length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters: 

X + (X - 3) = 20 

Solving for X: 

2X - 3 = 20 

2X = 23 

X = 11.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the total length of the rope is 20 meters. Therefore, we have the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let x be the length of the shorter piece of rope. Then the length of the longer piece of rope is x+3. We know that the sum of the two pieces is 20 meters: x + (x+3) = 20. Solving this equation gives us x=8.5. Therefore the length of the longer piece is x+3=11.5.

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
First we need to convert 21 minutes to hours: 

21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours 

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed on a windy day would be 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

Using the formula distance = rate x time, we get: 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, we need to convert the time into hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 21 minutes = 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in 1 hour, which means he can travel 15 * 0.35 = 5.25 miles in 21 minutes.

On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph, which means he only travels at 15 - 4 = 11 mph. In 0.35 hours, he can travel 11 * 0.35 = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
We can solve the problem by using the formula distance = rate x time. 

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in 60 minutes (1 hour). 

distance = rate x time = 15 miles/hour x (21/60) hour = 5.25 miles

On a windy day, his speed is reduced to 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. 

distance = rate x time = 11 miles/hour x (21/60) hour = 3.85 miles

Therefore, Bill can travel 3.85 miles on a windy day in 21 minutes.

Response 8:
To solve this problem, first we need to find how far Bill can travel in 21 minutes at his normal speed, then we need to calculate the distance he could travel on a windy day.

Let's start with the distance Bill can travel in 21 minutes at his normal speed:

Distance = rate × time = 15 mph × (21/60) hours = 5.25 miles/hour

Now, we need to calculate the distance he could travel on a windy day. His speed on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph.

Distance = rate × time = 11 mph × (21/60) hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. 21 minutes = 0.35 hours. Then, we can use the formula distance = rate x time. On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. So, distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
First, let's determine the ratio of red sweets to green sweets as a fraction. 

If the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, then the total number of parts is 3+4=7. 

The fraction representing the ratio of red sweets to the total number of sweets is 3/7. 

Next, we can use this fraction to determine the number of red sweets in the bag. 

If the bag contains 120 green sweets, then we can set up the following proportion: 

3/7 = x/120 

Where x represents the number of red sweets. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

3 * 120 = 7x 

360 = 7x 

x = 51.4 

So there are approximately 51 red sweets in the bag. 

Of the answer choices given, the closest answer is C: 95. But since none of the choices are particularly close to the correct answer, it's important to show the work involved in solving the problem rather than simply relying on the answer choices.
Response 1:
Let's start solving the problem by finding out the ratio of red sweets to green sweets. 

3x : 4x

Now, we know that the bag contains 120 green sweets, which is equal to 4x. 

4x = 120
x = 30

So, the bag contains 3x red sweets, which is equal to:

3x = 3(30) = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let the number of red sweets be represented by 3x (since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4)  
Let the number of green sweets be represented by 4x (since the ratio of red to green sweets is 3:4)  
If the bag contains 120 green sweets, then 4x = 120, so x = 30  
Therefore, the number of red sweets is 3x = 3(30) = 90  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we first need to find the total number of sweets in the bag. We can do that by dividing the number of green sweets by the ratio of green sweets to red sweets:

Total number of sweets = 120 / (4/3) = 90 * 3 = 270

Now that we know the total number of sweets, we can find the number of red sweets by multiplying the ratio of red sweets to green sweets by the total number of sweets:

Number of red sweets = 3/4 * 270 = 202.5

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 

None of the above is a possible option here. The closest answer is option A (90) but the correct answer is not listed. The exact answer is 202.5 red sweets, which is not a whole number and cannot be rounded to any of the given options.
Response 4:
To solve the problem, first we need to find the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of a common factor. Then, we can use this ratio to find the total number of sweets. 

Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets:

- Ratio of red sweets to green sweets: 3:4

This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. We can write this ratio in terms of a common factor by dividing both sides by 3:

- Ratio of red sweets to green sweets: 1:4/3

This means that for every 1 red sweet, there are 4/3 green sweets. Now we can use this ratio to find the total number of sweets:

- 4/3 green sweets = 120
- 1 green sweet = 120 / 4/3 = 90
- 1 red sweet = 1/4 * 4/3 * 90 = 30/3 = 10
- Total number of sweets = red sweets + green sweets = 3 * 10 + 4 * 90 = 360

Therefore, there are 30 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's first find the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of 4. 
We have 3 parts red sweets to 4 parts green sweets, which means that for every 4 green sweets, we have 3 red sweets. 

To find the number of red sweets, we need to set up a proportion: 

3/4 = x/120 

where x is the number of red sweets we need to find. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3*120 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To solve this, we can start by using the ratio between red and green sweets to find the ratio between the total number of sweets and the number of green sweets. 

Let x be the number of red sweets. Then, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4 can be expressed as:

3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

3 x 120 = 4 x
360 = 4x
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
We can begin by setting up a proportion between the number of green sweets and the ratio of red to green sweets.

Let x be the number of red sweets.
We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which can also be written as 3/4.
So the proportion we set up is:
4/3 = 120/x

We can solve for x by cross-multiplying:
4x = 3(120)
4x = 360
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  
Solution:
Since the company produces 420 components per month, it produces 420 x 12 = 5,040 components in a year. 
Let's denote the minimum selling price per component as x. 
The yearly revenue is then 5,040 x, and the yearly production cost is 5,040 x 110. 
The yearly profit is the difference between the yearly revenue and the yearly production cost, so we have:

5,040 x - 5,040 x 110 >= 626,400

Simplifying this inequality, we get:

x >= (626,400 + 5,040 x 110)/5,040

x >= 240

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component should be at least $240 to guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400.
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the yearly revenue from selling 420 components per month:
Revenue per component = minimum selling price that guarantees a yearly profit of $626,400 / total number of components produced per year.
Total number of components produced per year = 420 x 12 = 5040
Revenue per component =  (626400/5040) + 110 = 230
Therefore, the answer is  Answer("B").
Response 4:
First, we need to calculate the yearly production cost of 420 units per month:

Yearly production cost = 12 * 420 * 110 = $554,400

To make a profit of $626,400, the total revenue from selling the components needs to be:

Total revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit = $1,180,800

The minimum selling price per component to achieve this revenue is:

Minimum selling price = Total revenue / Total units produced annually
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / (12 * 420) = $230

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the yearly revenue: 

420 units/month x 12 months/year = 5,040 units/year

To achieve a yearly profit of $626,400, the revenue from sales should be:

Yearly profit = Yearly revenue - Yearly production cost
$626,400 = Yearly revenue - ($110 x 5,040)
$626,400 = Yearly revenue - $554,400
Yearly revenue = $1,180,800

So, the minimum selling price per component would be:

Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / Number of units produced per year
Minimum selling price = $1,180,800 / 5,040
Minimum selling price = $234

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 240.

Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 240
  C: 30
  D: 60
  E: 120
Response 0:
First, we need to convert the speed from miles per hour to miles per minute. To do this, we divide 12 by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour) to get 0.2 miles per minute.
Then, we can divide the total distance by the speed (in miles per minute) to get the time in minutes: 48 miles / 0.2 miles per minute = 240 minutes.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to solve this problem. 

The sum of k consecutive integers is given by: S = k/2(2a + (k-1)d)

where a is the first term, d is the common difference. Since the least integer is -50, a = -50.

From the problem statement, we know that the sum of the k integers is 51. Therefore, S = 51. 

We want to solve for k, so we can rearrange the formula and substitute in the values given: 

51 = k/2(-100 + (k-1)) 

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives: 

102 = k(-99 + k)

Rearranging and simplifying: 

k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0 

Using the quadratic formula: 

k = (99 +/- sqrt(99^2 - 4(1)(102))) / 2 

k = (99 +/- sqrt(9405)) / 2 

k = (99 +/- 97) / 2 

k = 98/2 or k = 2/2 

k = 49 or k = 1 

Since we are looking for consecutive integers, we can eliminate k = 1. 

Therefore, k = 49. 

Answer: Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's first find out the largest integer since we're given the least integer and k. 

The sum of k consecutive integers can be found using the formula: sum = (k/2)(first integer + last integer)

Let's first find the last integer:
51 = (k/2)(-50 + last integer)
2.04 = last integer

Since the last integer is not a whole number, we know that k is an even number.

Now we can find the last integer again using an even value for k:
51 = (k/2)(-50 + last integer)
102 = k(-50 + last integer)
102 = 2(-50 + last integer)
102 = -100 + 2(last integer)
202 = 2(last integer)
last integer = 101

So the largest integer is 101 and the smallest integer is -50. The sum of these integers is 152, which is the sum of 152/1 = 152 consecutive integers. 

Therefore, k = 152.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")  (since none of the given choices are correct)
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term. In this case, we have:

a_1 = -50
S = 51
n = k

We can also find a_n in terms of k: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1) = -50 + (k - 1) = -49 + k

Substituting these values into the formula for the sum, we get:

51 = (k/2)(-50 - 49 + k)
102 = k^2 - 99k

We can solve for k using the quadratic formula:

k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4(102)(-99))) / 2
k = (99 ± sqrt(39249)) / 2
k = (99 ± 199) / 2

Since k must be a positive integer, we take the positive root:

k = (99 + 199) / 2
k = 149/2

This is not an integer, so none of the answer choices are correct. However, the closest answer choice is D: 92, so we would select that as the answer.
Response 7:
We can start solving this problem by using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence: S = (n/2)(a1 + an), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the nth term. In this case, we have:

- S = 51 (the sum of the k consecutive integers)
- a1 = -50 (the least integer)
- an = a1 + (n-1) = -50 + (k-1) = -51 + k

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

51 = (k/2)(-50 + (-51 + k))
51 = (k/2)(-101 + k)
102 = k(-101 + k)
k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

We can solve for k using the quadratic formula:

k = (-(-101) +/- sqrt((-101)^2 - 4(1)(102))) / (2(1))
k = (101 +/- sqrt(103)) / 2

We can see that one of the roots is negative, so we can discard it. Therefore:

k = (101 + sqrt(103)) / 2

This is not one of the available choices, so we need to round it to the nearest integer. Using a calculator, we get:

k ≈ 62.8

Therefore, the closest choice is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Firstly, we can start by using the formula for the sum of k consecutive integers, which is `Sum = k * ((first integer + last integer) / 2)`. We know that the first integer is -50, so we need to find the last integer. We can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence to find it, which is `nth term = a + (n-1)*d`, where `a` is the first term, `n` is the term we want to find, and `d` is the common difference. Since we have k consecutive integers, we know that the common difference is 1.

So, we can write: 
- first integer = -50
- last integer = -50 + (k-1)*1 = -50 + k - 1 = -49 + k

Substituting these values into the formula `Sum = k * ((first integer + last integer) / 2)` and simplifying we get:

51 = k * ((-50 + (-49 + k)) / 2)
51 = k * (-99 + k) / 2
102 = k^2 - 99k
k^2 - 99k - 102 = 0

Solving for k using the quadratic formula:

k = (99 ± √(99^2 - 4*1*(-102))) / 2
k = (99 ± √(9801 + 408)) / 2
k = (99 ± √10209) / 2
k = (99 ± 101) / 2

We can discard the negative value and get:

k = (99 + 101) / 2
k = 100

Therefore, the answer is:

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Let's start by using the information given to find the length of the two painted sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then the length of the two painted sides added together is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. Since two sides of a rectangle have equal length, we can divide 28 by 2 to get the length of one of the painted sides, which is 14 feet. 

To find the area of the parking space, we need to multiply the length of the unpainted side by the length of one of the painted sides. So the area is 9 feet × 14 feet = 126 square feet.  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let L be the length of the painted side and W be the width of the parking space. We know that:
2L + W = 37 (sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37)
W = 9 (length of unpainted side is 9)
We can substitute W into the first equation:
2L + 9 = 37
2L = 28
L = 14
Now we can find the width of the parking space:
2(14) + W = 37
W = 9
So the width is also 9. 
The area of the parking space is:
14 x 9 = 126
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C").
Response 2:
First, we can start by using the information given to us in the problem to set up an equation. We know that the sum of the painted sides is 37 feet, and one of the unpainted sides has a length of 9 feet. This means that the other unpainted side must also have a length of 9 feet (since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length). Let's call the length of the rectangle "l" and the width of the rectangle "w". Then we can set up the equation:

2l + w = 37

We also know that the area of the rectangle is given by:

A = lw

We want to find the area of the rectangle, so we need to find the values of "l" and "w". We can do this by using the fact that one of the unpainted sides has a length of 9 feet. Since opposite sides of a rectangle are equal in length, we know that the other unpainted side also has a length of 9 feet. This means that:

2w + 18 = 37
2w = 19
w = 9.5

Now that we know the width of the rectangle, we can use the equation we set up earlier to find the length:

2l + 9.5 = 37
2l = 27.5
l = 13.75

So the length of the rectangle is 13.75 feet and the width is 9.5 feet. We can now calculate the area:

A = lw = 13.75 x 9.5 = 130.625

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 130.625 square feet. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, we can use the information provided to find the length and width of the rectangle. We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, and there are three painted sides, so the average length of a painted side is 37/3 = 12.33 feet (rounded to two decimal places). This means that the length and the width of the rectangle are 12.33 - 9 = 3.33 feet each. 

To find the area of the rectangle, we multiply the length and the width together: 3.33 x 3.33 = 11.0889 square feet (rounded to four decimal places). 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
First, let's find the length of the two painted sides. We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so:

painted side 1 + painted side 2 + unpainted side = 37
painted side 1 + painted side 2 + 9 = 37
painted side 1 + painted side 2 = 28

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the width of the rectangle is 9 feet.

The area of the rectangle is length times width, so:

area = length x width
area = painted side 1 x 9
area = painted side 2 x 9

We know that painted side 1 + painted side 2 = 28, so let's solve for painted side 1 in terms of painted side 2:

painted side 1 = 28 - painted side 2

Substitute this expression for painted side 1 in the area equation:

area = (28 - painted side 2) x 9
area = 252 - 9painted side 2

Now we need to find painted side 2. We know that painted side 1 + painted side 2 = 28, so:

painted side 2 = 28 - painted side 1
painted side 2 = 28 - (28 - painted side 2)
2painted side 2 = 28
painted side 2 = 14

Now we can find the area:

area = 252 - 9painted side 2
area = 252 - 9(14)
area = 126

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we need to use the fact that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since the parking space has four sides, and we know the length of one unpainted side, we can use algebra to find the length of the other painted side.

Let x be the length of one of the painted sides. Then we have:

x + x + 9 = 37

Simplifying this equation, we get:

2x + 9 = 37

2x = 28

x = 14

Therefore, one of the painted sides is 14 feet long, and the other painted side is also 14 feet long. The area of the parking space is the product of its length and width, which is:

14 * 9 = 126

So the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
To find the answer, we need to start by using the information given to us to write an equation. Let's call the length of the rectangle l and the width w. 

We know that one side (width) is unpainted and has a length of 9 feet. The sum of the lengths of the other three sides (two lengths and one width) is 37 feet. So we can write:

2l + w = 37 (equation 1)

We also know that the area of a rectangle is given by:

A = lw (equation 2)

We want to find the area, so we need to solve for l in equation 1 and substitute it into equation 2. 

2l + w = 37

2l = 37 - w

l = (37 - w)/2

Now we can substitute (37 - w)/2 for l in equation 2:

A = [(37 - w)/2]w

Simplifying:

A = (37w - w^2)/2

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of w that makes A as large as possible. We can do this by finding the vertex of the parabola that represents A as a function of w. The formula for the x-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in standard form (ax^2 + bx + c) is:

x = -b/2a

In our case, a = -1/2, b = 37, and c = 0. So:

w = -37/(2*(-1/2)) = 37

Now we can find l:

l = (37 - w)/2 = (37 - 37)/2 = 0

This means that our rectangle is actually a square with side length 9 feet + 2w = 83 feet. 

The area is:

A = lw = 83^2 = 6889 square feet

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
First, let's solve for the width of the parking space:
Let W be the width of the parking space.
Given: Perimeter = 2(L+W) = 37 feet. Therefore, L+W = 18.5 feet.
Also, L+W+9 = Perimeter of the rectangle = 2(L+W).
Substituting the value of L+W from above, we get:
18.5+9 = 2(L+W)
27.5 = 2(L+W)
L+W = 13.75
Subtracting width from both sides, we get L = 13.75 - W.
Now, we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is A = L*W.
Substituting the value of L, we get:
A = (13.75-W)*W = 13.75W - W^2
To maximize the area, we differentiate:
dA/dW = 13.75 - 2W = 0
W = 6.875 feet
Substituting the value of W in the equation for A, we get:
A = (13.75 - 6.875)*6.875 = 46.875 square feet

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 8
  C: 22
  D: 50
  E: 20
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
First, we need to find out how long it would take Jack to clean the entire yacht. If he can clean it in 12 hours, then his rate is 1/12 of the yacht per hour. 

Since Jack completes two-thirds of the work, the remaining one-third must be cleaned by Jill. Since Jill's rate is only 5% of Jack's rate, her rate is 1/20 of Jack's rate. 

Let's say it takes Jill x hours to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht. 

Using the formula rate x time = work, we can write two equations: 

Jack's work: (1/12) x 12 = 1 (the entire yacht) 
Jack's and Jill's work combined: (2/3) x 1 + (1/3) x 1 = 1 
Jill's work: (1/20) x x = (1/3) 

Simplifying the last equation, we get: 
x/20 = 1/3 
x = 20/3 

So it would take Jill 20/3 hours to clean the remaining one-third of the yacht.

The coin-diver can only bring copper or brass coins, or both. Let's assume that she brought only copper coins, so she got 20 cents for each coin that she brought. If she brought all copper coins, then the total number of coins she brought is 17 since:

20 cents x 17 copper coins = $3.40

Now, If she brought some brass coins too, then the number of copper coins she brought would be less than 17. However, we need to find the minimum number of copper coins, which is when she brought all copper coins. Therefore, the answer is A: 4.

Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Response 4:
First, we can start by using the given information to create two equations. Let x be the number of papers the hotel buys on each weekday, and let y be the number of papers the hotel buys on Sunday. We know:

- y = 2x (the hotel buys twice as many papers on Sunday as it does on each weekday)
- 4y + 1(7x) = 210 (the hotel pays $4 for each Sunday paper and $1 for each weekday paper, and the total cost of all the papers is $210)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get:

- 4(2x) + 1(7x) = 210
- 8x + 7x = 210
- 15x = 210
- x = 14

So the hotel buys 14 papers on each weekday. To find how many papers it buys on Monday, we just need to add up the number of weekday papers:

- 5(14) = 70

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 98 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
First, let's find the total number of people receiving the money:
5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11 people
Now, let's find the total amount each nephew receives:
Let the amount received by each nephew be x.
Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, so each daughter receives 4x.
Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, so each son receives 5x.
Total amount received by all 11 people = Rs 8600
2x + 4x*4 + 5x*5 = 8600
2x + 16x + 25x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200
Now that we know each nephew received Rs 200, we can find how much each daughter received:
Each daughter received 4 times as much as each nephew, so each daughter received 4*200 = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let the amount that each nephew receives be x.
Each daughter receives 4x and each son 5x.

Total number of recipients = 5+4+2 = 11

Therefore, 5x + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600
Solving this, we get x = 400

So, each daughter receives 4x = 4(400) = Rs 1600

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let X be the amount that each nephew receives. Then each daughter receives 4*X and each son receives 5*X.
The total number of recipients is 5+4+2=11.
We know that the total amount distributed is Rs 8600. Therefore,
5*5X + 4*4*X + 2*X = 8600
25X + 16X + 2X = 8600
43X = 8600
X = 200
Therefore, each daughter receives 4*X = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let the amount that each nephew receives be x
Each daughter, therefore, receives 4x
Each son receives 5x

The total amount given to the nephews = 2x
The total amount given to the daughters = 4 * 2x = 8x
The total amount given to the sons = 5 * 2x = 10x

Total amount = 8600

So, we have the equation:

2x + 8x + 10x = 8600

Solving for x, we get:

x = 400

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4 * 400 = Rs 1600

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
First, let's find the total number of parts in which the given amount is to be divided - 

Number of parts = 5 (sons) +4 (daughters) + 2 (nephews) = 11

Let each nephew's share be x.

Then, each daughter's share = 4x
And, each son's share = 5x

Total amount = 11x

According to the question,

11x = 8600

x = 8600/11

x = 782.81 (approx)

Each daughter's share = 4x = 4 * 782.81 = Rs 3131.24 (approx)

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that each nephew receives x amount. Then each daughter will receive 4x as per the question and each son will receive 5x. 

Now, the total number of divisions is 5+4+2=11
Therefore, 5x+4(4x)+2x = 8600
Simplifying the above equation, we get 23x=8600 which means x=Rs 400
So, each daughter will receive 4x which is Rs 1600.

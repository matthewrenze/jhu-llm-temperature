Topic: Math
Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let x be the number of all staplers produced on Monday. 
Then, 0.1x is the number of defective staplers and (0.9)(0.02)(x-0.1x) = 0.018(x-0.1x) = 0.018(0.9x) is the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected by mistake (using the fact that non-defective staplers correspond to 90% of all staplers produced on Monday). 
We know that the number of non-defective staplers that were rejected by mistake is 72, so we can set up the equation:
0.018(0.9x) = 72
Solving for x, we get:
x = 4,000
Therefore, the answer is A: 4,000. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
First, we can figure out that $0.02 = \frac{x}{72} \Rightarrow x = 1.44$, where $x$ is the number of defective staplers that were mistakenly rejected. 

Next, let $y$ be the total number of staplers produced. Then, 10% of $y$ or $\frac{y}{10}$ were defective. This means that $\frac{9y}{10}$ were non-defective. Since $1.44$ non-defective staplers were mistakenly rejected, we have that: 

$\frac{1.44}{\frac{9y}{10}} = \frac{2}{100} \Rightarrow y \approx 4500$

Therefore, we get:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's call the number of staplers produced "x".
10% of x were defective, which means 90% were non-defective. 
2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected, which means 98% were accepted.
We know that 72 non-defective staplers were rejected, so we can set up an equation:
0.02(0.9x) = 72
Solving for x:
0.018x = 72
x = 4,000
Therefore, the answer is (A) 4,000.

To ensure that at least two ties are of the same color, we need to apply the Pigeonhole Principle. There are 5 different colors, so we need to take out 1 tie more than the number of ties in the color with the most ties. In this case, the color with the most ties is violet with 13 ties. So, we need to take out 13 + 1 = 14 ties. However, we only need to take out two ties of the same color, so the answer is 2 + 1 = 3 ties. Therefore, the answer is B: 3.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.

Then, P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

We are given that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96.

Substituting the given values and simplifying, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)

0.4P(B) = 0.36

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.  
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)  
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs can be written as follows:  

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)  
Plug in the given values into the above formula and simplify:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 2:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring.

We know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A or B) = 0.96, and A and B are independent.

We can use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) since A and B may overlap.

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting these values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying the equation, we get:

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4 = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 3:
Let P(B) be the probability of event B occurring. Then, we have:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since events A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B). Substituting in the given probabilities, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is **Choice E: 0.9**.
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96, and since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

Substituting the given values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.36/0.4
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is E: 0.9.
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the probability of the union of two events:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)
Substituting the given values, we have:
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. We want to solve for P(B).
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  (since A and B are independent)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B)
0.4P(B) = 0.36
P(B) = 0.36 / 0.4

Action: Answer("C")   (which is 0.9)
Response 7:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. Then, we know that P(A) = 0.6, P(A U B) = 0.96, and events A and B are independent. Note that P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B), where P(A n B) is the probability that both A and B occur. Since A and B are independent, we have P(A n B) = P(A)P(B). Substituting these values and solving for P(B), we get:

P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A n B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 - 0.6 = 0.4P(B)
0.36 = 0.4P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let P(B) = x
Since A and B are independent, P(A intersection B) = P(A).P(B)
Probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs 
= P(A union B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A intersection B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A).P(B)
Therefore, 0.96 = 0.6 + x - (0.6)(x)
Solving for x, we get x = 0.8

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. 

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. 

Since A and B are independent, we have: P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) 

We can simplify this using the fact that A and B are independent: P(A and B) = P(A)*P(B) 

Substituting the given values, we get: 

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B) 

Solving for P(B), we get: 

P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - 0.6) 

P(B) = 0.6

Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
Response 0:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be "x".
From the question, we know that Meenu weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight.
So, we can create an equation: x = 29 + 0.5x
Solving the equation, we get: 0.5x = 29
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kg.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's assume Meenu's weight is "x" kg. According to the given problem, Meenu said that she weighs 29 kg plus half of her weight. So, we can form an equation as follows:
x = 29 + (1/2)x
By solving this equation, we get:
(1/2)x = 29
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
x = 58
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kg.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let M be the weight of Meenu in Kgs.
From the question, we know that she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight.
Therefore M = 29 + M/2.
Solving the equation, we get M = 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's denote Meenu's weight by "x". According to her statement, she weighs 29 Kgs plus half of her weight, which can be expressed as 29 + x/2. 
We know that Silu's weight is 51 Kgs. 
So, we can set up the equation 51 = 29 + x/2 and solve for x. 

51 - 29 = x/2 

22 = x/2 

x = 44 

Therefore, Meenu weighs 29 Kgs + half of her weight, which is 44/2 Kgs = 51 Kgs. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's denote Meenu's weight by M.
From the second statement, we know that M = 29 + 0.5M
Solving the above equation, we get M = 58
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
We can represent Meenu's weight with "x". From the given information, we know that:
x = 29 + (1/2)x

Solving for x:
x - (1/2)x = 29
(1/2)x = 29
x = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kgs.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's represent Meenu's weight as x.
From the given information, we know that:

x = 29 + 0.5x

Solving for x, we get:

0.5x = 29

x = 58

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's use "x" to represent Meenu's weight.

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Let x be the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day. 

The total number of golf balls in stock at the beginning of the day is 600: 

x (number of yellow golf balls) + w (number of white golf balls) = 600

We know that the store sold 80% of its inventory by the end of the day, so it had 20% (or 1/5) of the inventory left. We also know that the number of yellow golf balls sold is equal to the number of white golf balls sold: 

0.2 * 600 = x/2

Simplifying this equation gives: 

120 = x/2 

x = 240 

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls to begin the day. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's first determine the number of white golf balls sold by the store. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, then the total number of golf balls sold was 80% of the store's inventory, which is 0.8*600=<<0.8*600=480>>480 golf balls. Since all of the white golf balls were sold, then 480/2=<<480/2=240>>240 yellow golf balls were sold. Therefore, the store began with 600-480=<<600-480=120>>120 golf balls that were yellow. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls were sold by the store: 

Action: 600 x 0.8 = 480. This means that the store sold 480 golf balls. 

Now, we know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and that it sold all of its white golf balls. Therefore, the number of white golf balls sold must be a multiple of 2. Let's try the closest even number below 480, which is 478. 

If 478 golf balls were sold, then the store had 600 - 478 = 122 golf balls left at the end of the day. 

Since the same number of yellow and white golf balls were sold, there must be 61 white golf balls left at the end of the day. 

Therefore, the store started with 600 - 61 = 539 yellow golf balls. 

Answer: (E) 360
Response 3:
Let `x` be the number of yellow golf balls.
Then, the total number of golf balls we had at the beginning of the day is `x + 600 - x = 600`.
The store sold `80%` of the golf balls which means the store sold `0.8 * 600 = 480` golf balls in total. 
Since the store sold the same number of yellow and white golf balls and sold out of white golf balls, it follows that the number of white golf balls sold was `480 / 2 = 240`.
Since the store sold out of white golf balls and only had yellow golf balls left, `x` must be equal to `240`.
Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the total number of golf balls sold, which is 80% of 600 = 0.8 x 600 = 480. Since the number of yellow and white golf balls sold was equal and all of the white golf balls were sold, then the store sold 240 white golf balls and 240 yellow golf balls. Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Let's first find out how many total golf balls the store sold:
80% of 600 = 0.8 * 600 = 480
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls and sold all of its white golf balls, it sold 240 yellow golf balls. 
So, the number of yellow golf balls the store had to begin the day is:
600 total golf balls - 240 yellow golf balls sold = 360

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding out how many golf balls the store sold throughout the day: 

80% of 600 = 0.8 * 600 = 480 

This means the store sold 480 golf balls throughout the day. We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and that all the white golf balls were sold. Therefore, the store sold half of its total stock of golf balls in white. 

Thus, the store started with 600 / 2 = 300 white golf balls. 

Since all the white golf balls were sold, the store must have sold 150 white golf balls. 

If we subtract 150 from the total number of golf balls sold, we get the number of yellow golf balls sold: 

480 - 150 = 330 

So the store started with 330 yellow golf balls. 

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Let x be the number of both yellow and white golf balls that the store had to begin the day. 

If the store sold 80% of its inventory, then it sold 0.8x golf balls. 

Since the store sold the same number of yellow and white golf balls, then the number of white golf balls sold is equal to half the total number of white and yellow golf balls sold, which is 0.4x.

Since the store sold all of its white golf balls, then 0.4x is the number of white golf balls that the store had to begin the day, which means that 0.4x = 600 - x.

Solving for x gives x = 360.

Therefore, the store had 360 yellow golf balls to begin the day.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let y be the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day.
Since the store sold all its white golf balls and yellow and white golf balls were sold equally, then the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day is y.
The store had 600 golf balls at the beginning of the day and sold 80% of its inventory, which means that the store sold 0.8 * 600 = 480 golf balls.
Because the number of white golf balls sold equals the number of white golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day, then the store sold y white golf balls.
Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, then the store sold y yellow golf balls.
The total number of golf balls sold is y white golf balls + y yellow golf balls = 2y
Thus, 2y = 480, which implies y = 240.
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 240.
Response 9:
Let's first find out how many golf balls were sold. The store sold 80% of its inventory, which is 600 golf balls, so it sold 0.8 x 600 = 480 golf balls. Since the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, we know that it sold half of the total number of golf balls in white, and half in yellow. Therefore, the store sold 480/2 = 240 white golf balls.

Let Y be the number of yellow golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day. Since it started with 600 golf balls and sold 240 white golf balls, it must have had Y + 240 yellow golf balls to begin with. 

Therefore, the total number of golf balls the store had at the beginning of the day (white and yellow combined) was 240 + Y. Since we know this number is 600, we can set up an equation:

240 + Y = 600

Solving for Y:

Y = 360

So, the store had 360 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let's assign variables to represent the bus fare for two persons and the train fare for one person. Let's use b for bus fare and t for train fare. Given that the bus fare for two persons is four-thirds the train fare for one person, we can write the equation:

b = (4/3)t

To solve for t, we need another equation relating the total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus and 8 persons travelling by train between the two places to t. The total fare paid by 6 persons travelling by bus is 3b (since b is for two persons) and the total fare paid by 8 persons travelling by train is 8t. So we can write another equation:

3b + 8t = 1512

Now we can substitute the first equation into the second equation to get an equation in terms of t:

3(4/3)t + 8t = 1512

Simplifying:

4t + 8t = 1512
12t = 1512
t = 126

Therefore, the train fare between Agra and Aligarh for one person is Rs.126.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Let L be the length of the longer rope. Then the length of the shorter rope is L - 3. From the problem, we know that the sum of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. Thus, we have the equation L + (L - 3) = 20. Solving this equation for L, we get L = (20 + 3)/2 = 11.5 meters. Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can use algebra. Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. Then, the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3. We know that the two pieces of rope add up to 20 meters, so we can write an equation:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying this equation, we get:
2x - 3 = 20
Adding 3 to both sides, we get:
2x = 23
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
x = 11.5
Therefore, the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope in meters.  
Then the length of the shorter piece is (x - 3) meters.  
Since both pieces come from a 20-meter long rope, we have:  
x + (x - 3) = 20.  
Simplifying this equation, we get:  
2x - 3 = 20,  
2x = 23,  
x = 11.5.  

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
Then the length of the shorter piece of rope is (x-3) meters.
The total length of the rope is the sum of the lengths of the two pieces of rope, so we have:

x + (x-3) = 20

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

2x = 23

x = 11.5

Therefore, the answer is D: 11.5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's call the length of the longer piece of rope "x". Then we know that the length of the shorter piece is "x-3". We also know that the two pieces of rope together add up to 20m. Therefore, we can write an equation: x + (x-3) = 20.
Simplifying this equation, we get 2x - 3 = 20.
Adding 3 to both sides, we get 2x = 23.
Finally, dividing both sides by 2, we get x = 11.5.

Action: Answer("D") 
Response 6:
Let's call the length of the longer piece x. Since the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the other, the length of the shorter rope would be x - 3. Also, we know that the two pieces of rope combined are 20 meters long. Therefore, we can set up an equation: x + (x - 3) = 20. Solving for x gives us x = 11.5. So the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope, then the length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
The total length of the rope is 20 meters, so we can create the equation: x + (x - 3) = 20
This simplifies to 2x - 3 = 20
Solving for x: 2x = 23
x = 11.5
Therefore the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters long.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope. 
The length of the shorter piece is then x - 3. 
The sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + (x-3) = 20

Simplifying this expression, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's solve the problem step by step. Let's assume that the length of the longer piece is "x" meters. Then, according to the problem, the length of the shorter piece is "x - 3" meters. 

We know that the sum of the length of the two pieces of rope is 20 meters. So, we can write the equation:

x + (x - 3) = 20

Simplifying the equation, we get:

2x - 3 = 20

Adding 3 to both sides of the equation, we get:

2x = 23

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:

x = 11.5

So, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Topic: Math
Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem we need to convert the time of 21 minutes into hours, then multiply by the speed of Bill on a windy day. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, let's convert 21 minutes to hours by dividing by 60: 21/60 = 0.35 hours. 

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced to 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

To find how far he can travel, we can use the formula distance = rate x time: 

distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles 

So the answer is D: 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
First, let's convert 21 minutes into hours by dividing it by 60: 21 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.35 hours

On a windy day, Bill's speed is reduced by 4 mph, so his speed becomes 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph.

To find how far he can travel in 0.35 hours at 11 mph, we can multiply his speed by the time: 11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours, which is 0.35 hours (21 divided by 60). 

On a normal day, Bill travels at 15 mph. So on a windy day, his speed will be 15-4 = 11 mph. 

To find how far Bill can travel, we can use the formula: distance = speed × time. 

distance = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles. 

Therefore the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours.

Action: Answer("E")  
We can convert minutes to hours by dividing by 60. 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.

Next, we can use the formula distance = rate x time to find how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 0.35 hours. 

His rate on a windy day is 15 - 4 = 11 mph. 

distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles. 

Rounding to the nearest hundredth, we get 3.85 which is answer choice D.
Response 9:
To solve this problem we can use the formula distance = rate × time. 

Action: Answer("D") 

Here's the solution:
- On a normal day, Bill's rate (or speed) is 15 mph.
- On a windy day, his rate is reduced by 4 mph, which means his rate is 11 mph.
- We need to find out how far he can travel in 21 minutes, which is 0.35 hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour and 21/60 = 0.35).
- Distance = rate × time = 11 mph × 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth).

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In a bag of red and green sweets, the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, how many red sweets are there?
Choices:
  A: 90
  B: 80
  C: 95
  D: 100
  E: 85
Response 0:
Let's use the ratio to find out how many red sweets are there.

Let's say the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3x : 4x (we can set any value to x)
And we know that the bag has a total of 7x sweets.

Now we are given that there are 120 green sweets, which is equal to 4x.
Solving for x, we get:
x = 120/4 = 30

So the bag has a total of 7x = 7*30 = 210 sweets.
And the number of red sweets is 3x = 3*30 = 90.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") 
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Solution: 

Let's start by finding the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in fraction form. 

3/4 = x/120 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

4x = 3 * 120 

4x = 360 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
We can start the problem by finding out the ratio between red sweets and green sweets, which is 3:4. This means for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets. We also know that there are 120 green sweets. 

To find the number of red sweets, we can set up a proportion: 

3/4 = x/120 

Multiplying both sides by 120, we get: 

x = (3/4) * 120 

x = 90 

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we can start by using the ratio between red and green sweets. 

Let x be the number of red sweets. According to the ratio, the number of green sweets is 4/3 times the number of red sweets. We can use this information to create an equation:

4/3 * x = 120

To solve for x, we can multiply both sides by 3/4:

x = 3/4 * 120 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let R be the number of red sweets. 
Let G be the number of green sweets.
From the problem, we know that 

R : G = 3 : 4

We also know that G = 120. 

We can use this information to solve for R. 

R : G = 3 : 4 
R : 120 = 3 : 4    (Substituting G with 120)
4R = 3 x 120
4R = 360
R = 360/4
R = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To solve for the number of red sweets, we need to use the ratio of red sweets to green sweets which is 3:4. This means for every 3 red sweets in the bag, there are 4 green sweets. If the bag contains 120 green sweets, we can use this ratio to find out how many red sweets are in the bag.

Let x be the number of red sweets:
3/4 = x/120

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply to get:
4x = 3 * 120
4x = 360
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the ratio of red sweets to green sweets in terms of a common factor. If we divide both sides of the ratio 3:4 by 4, we get 3/4:1. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there is 1 green sweet.  
We are given that there are 120 green sweets, so we can set up the following proportion: 
3/4 = x/120  
where x is the number of red sweets.  
To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:  
4x = 3 * 120  
x = 90  
Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
Let p be the minimum selling price per component. The yearly revenue earned by selling 420 components every month would be equal to 12 * 420 * p = 5,040p. Since the monthly production cost is $110 per component, the yearly production cost would be 12 * 420 * 110 = 554,400. Therefore, the yearly profit would be 5,040p - 554,400. We need to find the minimum value of p such that the yearly profit is at least $626,400. Solving the equation for p, we get:

5,040p - 554,400 >= 626,400
5,040p >= 1,180,800
p >= 234.127

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $235 (rounded to the nearest dollar), which is closest to choice B: 230. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Here's the solution to the problem:

There are 12 months in a year, so the company produces a total of 420 x 12 = 5040 components in a year. The production cost of each component is $110, so the total production cost for all components in a year is 110 x 5040 = $554,400.

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit to be at least $626,400, we need to find the total revenue from selling all the components in a year.

Let the selling price per component be S. Then the total revenue from selling all the components in a year is S x 5040.

The yearly profit is the total revenue minus the total production cost, so we have:

S x 5040 - $554,400 >= $626,400

S x 5040 >= $1,180,800

S >= $1,180,800 / 5040

S >= $234.13 (rounded to the nearest cent)

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit to be at least $626,400 is $234.13, which is closest to choice A: 226.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Let's start by calculating the yearly cost of production, which is the amount of components produced per month multiplied by the cost per component, then multiplied by 12 (months in a year):

Yearly production cost = 420 * $110 * 12 = $554,400

To make a profit of at least $626,400 a year, the revenue from sales needs to be:

Yearly revenue = $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800

To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee this revenue, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year:

Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / (420 * 12) = $230

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's calculate the yearly profit:
Yearly production cost = $110/component * 12 months * 420 components/month = $647,760
Yearly profit = $626,400
Yearly revenue = Yearly production cost + Yearly profit = $1,274,160
To find the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee the yearly profit, we need to divide the yearly revenue by the number of components produced per year:
Minimum selling price = Yearly revenue / (# of components/month * 12 months) = $1,274,160 / (420 * 12) = $253.333, which is closest to choice (D) 260. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let P be the selling price per component. The company sells 420 components each month, so its revenue from sales each month is 420P. The company's total cost every month is 420 * $110 = $46,200. The company's monthly profit is therefore 420P - $46,200. Its yearly profit is 12 times this amount or $626,400. We can write this information as an equation and solve for P. 

12(420P - 46,200) ≥ 626,400 

5,040P - 554,400 ≥ 626,400 

5,040P ≥ 1,180,800 

P ≥ $234 

So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit will be at least $626,400 is $234.

Question: The sum of k consecutive integers is 51. If the least integer is -50, then k =
Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = (n/2)(a_1 + a_n), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the nth term. 

In this problem, we have: 
S = 51 (the sum of k consecutive integers)
a_1 = -50 (the least integer)
a_n = -50 + (k-1) (the greatest integer)
We want to find k.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get: 
51 = (k/2)(-50 + (-50 + k - 1))
51 = (k/2)(-100 + k)
102 = k^2 - 100k
k^2 - 100k - 102 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for k: 
k = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a, where a = 1, b = -100, and c = -102. 

Plugging in these values, we get: 
k = (-(-100) ± sqrt((-100)^2 - 4(1)(-102))) / 2(1) 
k = (100 ± sqrt(10000 + 408)) / 2 
k = (100 ± sqrt(10408)) / 2 

Since k is a positive integer, we can ignore the negative solution. 
k = (100 + sqrt(10408)) / 2 ≈ 62.08

Therefore, the closest whole number to k is 62. 

Answer: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can solve this math problem using algebra.
Let x be the first integer, then the sum of k consecutive integers starting from x is given by:
x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = kx + (1 + 2 + ... + k-1)
where 1 + 2 + ... + k-1 is the sum of the first k-1 positive integers, which is equal to:
1 + 2 + ... + k-1 = (k-1)k/2
Now we can substitute x=-50 and set the sum equal to 51:
k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51
Simplifying this algebraic equation, we get:
k^2 - 99k - 102=0
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula or factoring, we get:
k = 3 or k = 96
Since we want the value of k to be positive and we need the sum of more than 1 consecutive integer to be 51, the correct answer is:
Action: Answer("D")  k = 96
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we know that the sum of k consecutive integers is given by the formula: sum = (k/2)*(2a + (k-1)d), where a is the first term, d is the common difference and k is the number of terms. 

In this case, the first term a is -50, and since we are summing k consecutive integers, the common difference d is 1. 

Substituting these values into the formula, we get: 

51 = (k/2)*(-99 + k)

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get: 

102 = k*(-99 + k)

Rearranging and simplifying, we get: 

k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0

Using the quadratic formula, we get: 

k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*1*102))/2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9603))/2

Since we are looking for a positive integer value of k, we can disregard the negative solution. 

k = (99 + sqrt(9603))/2 

k ≈ 101.87

Therefore, the closest answer is E: 102. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We can begin solving this problem by using the formula for the sum of arithmetic sequence (sum = average x number of terms). We can also use the fact that the integers are consecutive, so we can represent them as n, n+1, n+2, and so on, up to n+k-1. 

First, let's find the average of these integers:
average = (n + (n+k-1))/2
average = (2n + k - 1)/2

Since the least integer is -50, we know that n = -50.  
sum = 51
average x k = 51
(2n + k - 1)/2 x k = 51
(-100 + k - 1)k/2 = 51
(-99 + k)k/2 = 51
(-99k + k^2)/2 = 51
k^2 - 99k - 102 = 0

We can use the quadratic formula to solve for k:
k = (-(-99) +/- sqrt((-99)^2 - 4(1)(-102)))/2(1)
k = (99 +/- sqrt(405))/2
k = (99 +/- 9sqrt(15))/2

Since we are looking for a positive integer value for k, we can discard the negative solution, which gives us:
k = (99 + 9sqrt(15))/2

This value is not one of the answer choices. However, we can see that k is very close to 50, so we can estimate that the closest answer choice is A: 40. This makes sense because we are looking for consecutive integers, so k must be less than 51. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let's call the number of consecutive integers "k". 
The sum of consecutive integers can be found using the formula: sum = (number of integers) * (average of integers)
The average of k consecutive integers can be found by taking the average of the first and last integer, which would be: 
(-50 + last integer) / 2
Since we know that the sum of the k consecutive integers is 51, we can plug in the values we know and solve for k:
51 = k * (-50 + (-50 + k - 1)) / 2
Simplifying: 
102 = k * (-99 + k) 
Dividing both sides by -1: 
-102 = k^2 - 99k 
Rearranging into standard quadratic form: 
k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0 
Solving for k using the quadratic formula: 
k = (99 ± sqrt(99^2 - 4*1*102)) / 2
k = (99 ± sqrt(9405)) / 2
k ≈ 1.92 or k ≈ 97.08
Since k must be a positive integer, we can rule out the decimal solution and choose Answer("D") k = 92
Response 9:
We can solve this problem by setting up an equation, where x is the least integer and k is the number of integers being summed: 

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51 

Simplifying, 

kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51 

kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51 

Plug in x = -50 

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51 

-50k + k^2/2 - k/2 + 1/2 = 51 

k^2 - 101k + 104 = 0 

Using the quadratic formula, 

k = (-(-101) ± sqrt((-101)^2 - 4(1)(104)))/(2(1)) 

k = (101 ± sqrt(101^2 - 4(104)))/2 

k = (101 ± sqrt(10121))/2 

k ≈ 3.57 or k ≈ 97.43 

Since k must be a positive integer, the only possible answer is k = 97

Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's solve the problem step by step:

Let L be the length and W be the width of the parking space.
We know that W = 9 (since that's the length of the unpainted side).
The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is (2L + W) = (2L + 9) = 37.
Solving for L, we get L = 14.
The area of the parking space is L * W = 14 * 9 = 126.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
First, we know that 3 sides are painted, so one side is not painted. We can call the length of the painted sides "x" and the width of the rectangle "y". We have the following equations:
2x + y = 37 (the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet)
y = 9 (the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet)
We solve for x by substituting y = 9 into the first equation:
2x + 9 = 37
2x = 28
x = 14
So the length of the painted sides is 14 feet each, and the unpainted side is 9 feet. The area of the rectangle is:
14 x 9 = 126
Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C").
Response 6:
First, we need to find the length of the other side of the rectangle. Let x be the length of one of the painted sides. Then, the perimeter of the rectangle is 2x + 9 = 37. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Therefore, the length and width of the rectangle are 14 and 9, respectively. The area of the rectangle is length times width, which is 14 x 9 = 126.  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
First, we can determine that the painted sides are each length (37 - 9)/2 = 14 feet. Then we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle: length x width. We know that the width is 9, so we just need to multiply it by the length (14), giving us an area of 126 square feet. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let x be the length of the painted side and y be the width of the rectangle. We know that y = 9 and 2x + y = 37. Solving for x, we get x = 14. Hence, the area of the rectangle is xy = 14 * 9 = 126 square feet. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Since the parking space is rectangular, and one side is unpainted, its length must be 9 feet. If the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then the sum of the lengths of the two other sides is 28 feet (37 - 9 = 28). Since these two painted sides are opposite each other, they must have equal lengths. Therefore, each painted side has a length of 14 feet (28 / 2 = 14). The area of the rectangle can be found by multiplying the length and width, which are 14 feet and 9 feet, respectively. So, the area is 126 square feet.

  D: 320
  E: 315
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First we need to find the selling price of the article.
We know that profit is 20% and selling price is Rs.360.
Let's assume the cost price of the article is x.
So, selling price = cost price (100% + profit%) = x (100% + 20%) = 1.2x
Selling price = Rs. 360, so 1.2x = 360
Solving for x, we get x = 300

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let C be the cost price of the article.
Then, the selling price of the article is (C + 20% of C) = 1.2C
We are given that the selling price is Rs.360.
Therefore, 1.2C = 360.
Solving for C, we get C = (360/1.2) = 300.

Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Let n be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, and let N be the initial number of lilies. Since the number of lilies doubles every two days, after n days, there will be N*2^(n/2) lilies on the lake. We know that after 60 days, there are 2^30 lilies on the lake, since 60/2=30. We also know that there are 64 lilies initially, so N=64. 

To find the value of n that satisfies N*2^(n/2) = 2^30, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by N and taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides. This gives us: 

n/2 + log2(N) = 30 

Substituting N=64, we get: 

n/2 + 6 = 30 

n/2 = 24 

n = 48 

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies after 48 days. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let d be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies when initially there were 64 water lilies on it. 

After two days, there will be 64 * 2 = 128 water lilies on the lake.
After four days, there will be 128 * 2 = 256 water lilies on the lake.
We can notice that the number of water lilies on the lake after 2n days is 64 * 2^n. 

Since we know that the lake is fully covered with lilies after 60 days if there is exactly one water lily on the lake initially, we have the equation:
64 * 2^d = (2^30)

Dividing both sides by 64, we get:
2^d = 2^30 / 64 = 2^27

Taking the logarithm base 2 on both sides, we get:
d = log2(2^27) = 27

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies in 27 days if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies be "x" days. 

Initially, there were 64 water lilies on the lake, which means the lake will be fully covered with water lilies when the number of lilies reaches 64 x 2^(x/2) = 2^6 * 2^(x/2) = 2^(x/2 + 6)

We know that when there was only one water lily, it took 60 days to fully cover the lake. Therefore:

2^(60/2 + 6) = 2^36 = 68719476736

Now we need to find "x" when there are 64 water lilies initially:

2^(x/2 + 6) = 64 * 2^6 = 4096

Simplifying the equation:

2^(x/2) = 4096/64 = 64

Taking the logarithm base 2 of both sides:

x/2 = log2(64) = 6

x = 12

Therefore, it will take 12 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let X be the number of days required. Then we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: 

    64 * 2^(X/2) = 2^(60/2)

Simplifying this equation:

    64 * 2^(X/2) = 2^30
    2^(6 + X/2) = 2^30
    6 + X/2 = 30
    X/2 = 24
    X = 48

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with water lilies in 48 days.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 88 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
First, we need to find the length and width of the rectangular plot. Let L be the length and W be the width. We know that:
2L + 2W = 340 (perimeter is the sum of all sides)
L + W = 170
W = 170 - L

Now, we need to find the area of the rectangular plot including the 1-metre boundary on all sides. The new length would be L + 2 and the new width would be W + 2. So:
Area = (L+2) x (W+2)
Area = (L+2)(170-L+2)
Area = 172L - L^2 + 176
Area = -L^2 + 172L + 176

The cost of gardening would be the area multiplied by the rate of 10 per square metre. So:
Cost = 10(-L^2 + 172L + 176)
Cost = -10L^2 + 1720L + 1760

To find the value of L that would minimize the cost, we can take the derivative of the cost function and set it equal to zero:
dCost/dL = -20L + 1720 = 0
L = 86

Now we can substitute L=86 into our cost function to find the minimum cost:
Cost = -10(86)^2 + 1720(86) + 1760
Cost = 73960

Therefore, the cost of gardening the 1-metre boundary around the rectangular plot at the rate of 10 per square metre would be $73960.

Action: Answer("E")  None of these  (The correct answer is $73960, which is not listed as a choice)

Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Solution:
Let’s assume the width of the rectangular plot is ‘x’ meters.
The perimeter of the rectangular plot will be given as: 2(length+x) = 340
Length (l) = (340/2) - x = 170 - x
Given, we need to plant a 1-metre wide boundary around the rectangular plot.
Width of the rectangular plot including boundary = (x + 2)
Length of the rectangular plot including boundary = (170 - x + 2)
Area of rectangular plot including boundary = (x + 2)(170 - x + 2)
= (x+2)(172-x)
= -x²+168x+344
Cost of gardening per sq. metre = 10
Total cost of the gardening = Cost per sq. metre x Area of plot
= 10(-x² + 168x + 344)
= -10x² + 1680x + 3440
= -10(x² - 168x - 344)
= -10(x - 84 + 20.9)(x - 84 - 20.9)
= -10(x - 63.1)(x - 104.9)
Hence, the cost of gardening will be minimum at x=63.1. We cannot find the exact cost of gardening without knowing the value of 'x'. Therefore, the Answer is D: Cannot be determined.

Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
The volume of the tank is (8 * 6 * 2.5) cubic meters = 120 cubic meters. Since one cubic meter equals 1000 liters, the capacity of the tank is 120000 liters. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
First, let's find the volume of the tank and then convert it into litres. 

Action: Answer("D") - 120,000 litres.

The formula for the volume of a rectangular prism (which is what a tank is) is V = lwh, where l, w, and h are the length, width, and height, respectively. 

V = (8 m) × (6 m) × (2.5 m) = 120 m³

Now, 1 m³ of liquid is equal to 1000 litres. So, 

V in litres = 120 m³ × 1000 litres/m³ = 120,000 litres

Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")  
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution: The selling price of 90 kg of oranges is Rs. 7.50 x 90 = Rs. 675. The profit made by the merchant is Rs. (675 - 450) = Rs. 225. Therefore, the gain percentage is (225/450) x 100% = 50%.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")  
Solution: The total selling price of 90 kg of oranges = 90 × 7.5 = Rs. 675. 
Thus, the profit = selling price - cost price = 675 - 450 = Rs. 225.
percentage gain = profit / cost price * 100 = (225 / 450) * 100 = 50%. Therefore, the answer is A) 50%.

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?

  A: Rs 400

  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let the amount each nephew receives be x.
Then, each daughter will receive 4x and each son will receive 5x.

The total number of people receiving money is 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11

Thus, we have the equation: 
5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600
43x = 8600
x = 200

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, we need to find out the total number of parts the amount is divided into. 

Total parts = 5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews 

Total parts = 11 parts 

Let the amount that each nephew receives be x 

Then, each daughter would receive 4x and each son would receive 5x. 

Total amount = 2x + 4 daughters * 4x + 5 sons * 5x 

Total amount = 2x + 16x + 25x 

Total amount = 43x 

As per the question, 

Total amount = Rs 8600 

Therefore, 

43x = 8600 

x = 200 

So, each daughter would receive 4x = 4 * 200 = Rs 800

Response 9:
Let each nephew receive x amount. Then each son will receive 5x and each daughter will receive 4x. 

The total number of recipients is 11, so we can set up the equation: 

5(5x) + 4(4x) + 2(x) = 8600 

Simplifying: 

25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 

43x = 8600 

x = 200 

So each daughter receives 4x = 4(200) = Rs 800.

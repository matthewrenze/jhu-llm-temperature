Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The correct answer is A) 21 meters. 

Here's the explanation: 

Let "x" be the height of the tree. 

We can set up a proportion: 

height of pole / length of pole's shadow = height of tree / length of tree's shadow 

Using the values given in the problem, we have: 

14 / 10 = x / 15 

Simplifying this proportion: 

2.8 = x / 15 

To solve for "x", we can cross-multiply: 

2.8 * 15 = x 

x = 42 

Therefore, the height of the tree is 42 meters.

Question: At a certain factory, 10 percent of the staplers produced on Monday were defective and 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected by mistake. If 72 of the non-defective staplers were rejected, what was the number of staplers produced that day?
Choices:
  A: 4,000
  B: 4,200
  C: 4,500
  D: 4,800
  E: 5,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can start by figuring out how many of the staplers produced were defective: 

10 percent of any number is the same as multiplying that number by 0.1. So if we let x be the number of staplers produced, then 0.1x were defective.

That means the number of non-defective staplers produced was 0.9x. 

Next, we know that 2 percent of the non-defective staplers were rejected. We can write that as 0.02 times the number of non-defective staplers: 

0.02 * 0.9x = 72

Simplifying: 

0.018x = 72 

x = 4000 

So the answer is A: 4,000. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let x be the number of non-defective staplers produced on Monday. Therefore, the number of defective staplers produced is 0.1x. Out of these two groups of staplers, 2% of the non-defective staplers were rejected. So, (0.02)x non-defective staplers were rejected. We also know that the total number of non-defective staplers rejected was 72. So: 

0.02x = 72 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 3,600 

Thus, the total number of staplers produced is: 

x + 0.1x = 1.1x = 1.1(3,600) = 3,960 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("A") 4,000.

To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same colour, we need to use the Pigeonhole Principle. The worst case is that we select one tie of each colour. In that case, we would have 5 ties. But, the 6th tie we select must match one of the previous ties. Therefore, we need to select at least 3 ties.

Question: The events A and B are independent. The probability that event A occurs is 0.6, and the probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs is 0.96. What is the probability that event B occurs?
Choices:
  A: 0.5
  B: 0.6
  C: 0.7
  D: 0.8
  E: 0.9
Response 0:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.   
Using the formula for the probability of the union of two events, we know that:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A)P(B)

Substituting the given information, we have:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)

Simplifying and solving for P(B), we get:

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.36/0.4

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.9

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let's use the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) to solve this problem.

We know that P(A) = 0.6 and P(A or B) = 0.96. We need to find P(B).

We can rearrange the formula to solve for P(B):
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 x P(B))       since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 - 0.2P(B)
0.36 = -0.2P(B)
P(B) = -0.36/-0.2
P(B) = 1.8

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.8. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let's start by using the formula for the probability of the union of two events:

P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting the given probabilities:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6 * P(B))

Solving for P(B):

0.36 = 0.4P(B)

P(B) = 0.9

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Let P(B) = x

P(A) = 0.6

P(A or B) = 0.96

We know that P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B)

0.96 = 0.6 + x - 0.6x

Solving for x, 

x = 0.8

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.8. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.

We know that P(A) = 0.6.
We also know that P(A or B) = 0.96.
The probability that at least one of the events A or B occurs can be calculated using the formula P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), where P(A and B) is the probability that both events A and B occur.

Since A and B are independent, P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B).

Substituting these values, we get:

0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6 * P(B)
0.36 = 0.4 * P(B)
P(B) = 0.9

Answer: Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
First, we know:
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96
Since A and B are independent, we can use the formula:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)
We want to solve for P(B), so we rearrange the formula:
P(B) = (P(A or B) - P(A)) / (1 - P(A and B))

Substituting what we know:
P(B) = (0.96 - 0.6) / (1 - (0.6 * P(B)))
P(B) = 0.36 / (1 - 0.6P(B))
P(B) = 0.36 / (0.4 - 0.6P(B))
0.4P(B) - 0.6(P(B))^2 = 0.36
0.6(P(B))^2 - 0.4P(B) + 0.36 = 0
Using the quadratic formula, we get:
P(B) = (0.4 ± sqrt(0.16 - 0.864)) / 1.2
P(B) = (0.4 ± sqrt(-0.704)) / 1.2
Since the square root is negative, there is no real solution for P(B)
Therefore, we select the most likely answer which is: 

Action: Answer("None. There is no real solution for P(B)")
Response 6:
Let's use P(A) = 0.6, P(AUB) = 0.96. Since A and B are independent events, P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
We can solve for P(B):
P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A)P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - (0.6)(P(B))
0.96 = 0.6 + 0.4P(B) - 0.6P(B)
0.96 = 0.6 - 0.2P(B)
0.36 = -0.2P(B)
P(B) = -0.36/-0.2

Action: Answer("C") # 0.7
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let P(B) be the probability that event B occurs.  
We know that P(A) = 0.6  
By the addition rule of probability,  
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)  
Since events A and B are independent,   
P(A and B) = P(A) * P(B) = 0.6P(B)  
Substituting into P(A or B), we get  
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0.6P(B)  
Solving for P(B), we get  
P(B) = 0.8  

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let P(A) be the probability that event A occurs and P(B) be the probability that event B occurs. We know that:
P(A) = 0.6
P(A or B) = 0.96

Since the events A and B are independent, we have:
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

If we assume that P(A and B) = 0, then we can solve for P(B):
0.96 = 0.6 + P(B) - 0
P(B) = 0.36

Therefore, the probability that event B occurs is 0.36, which is choice A.

Question: Silu and Meenu were walking on the road.
Silu said, "I weigh 51 Kgs. How much do you weigh?"
Meenu replied that she wouldn't reveal her weight directly as she is overweight.
But she said, "I weigh 29 Kgs plus half of my weight. "How much does Meenu weigh?
Choices:
  A: 12
  B: 28
  C: 27
  D: 58
  E: 91
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let M be Meenu's weight.
We can write the given equation as M = 29 + (1/2)M
Solving the above equation, we get M = 58 Kgs.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
First, we can create an equation to represent what Meenu said: Meenu's weight = 29 + 0.5(Meenu's weight).

We can then simplify this by combining like terms: Meenu's weight = 29.5(Meenu's weight)

Next, we can isolate the variable "Meenu's weight" to one side by subtracting 0.5(Meenu's weight) from both sides: Meenu's weight - 0.5(Meenu's weight) = 29

Simplifying this, we get: 0.5(Meenu's weight) = 29

Finally, we can solve for Meenu's weight by dividing both sides by 0.5: Meenu's weight = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let "M" be Meenu's weight.
From the problem, we know that Meenu's weight can be represented as M = 29 + M/2.
Solving for M, we get M = 58Kg.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's solve for Meenu's weight:
Let's assume her weight to be X kg
As per the question, she weighs 29 kg more than half her weight, which can be written as:
X = 29 + X/2
By solving the above equation,
X/2 = 29
X = 58

Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 kg.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's represent Meenu's weight with the variable "M".
As per the given information, we can form the equation  M = 29 + 0.5M
Solving the above equation, we get M = 58
So, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
In order to find Meenu's weight, we need to solve the equation:
Meenu's weight = 29 + 0.5(Meenu's weight)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
0.5(Meenu's weight) = Meenu's weight - 29
0.5(Meenu's weight) = Meenu's weight/2
So, Meenu's weight = (Meenu's weight/2) + (Meenu's weight - 29)
Solving for Meenu's weight, we get:
Meenu's weight = 58
Answer: Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's assume Meenu's weight to be "x" kgs.
According to the problem, Meenu's weight is 29 kgs plus half of her weight. 
So we can write, x = 29 + x/2.
Solving the equation for x, we get x = 58.
Therefore, Meenu weighs 58 Kgs.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let's assume Meenu's weight as "M" 
According to the question, Meenu's weight is "29 Kgs plus half of her weight" 

So, M = 29 + M/2
Solving this equation, we get M = 58 Kgs

Question: A sporting goods store carries only yellow and white golf balls. At the beginning of the day it had 600 golf balls in stock, and by the end of the day it had sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. If the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, and in doing so sold all of its white golf balls, how many yellow golf balls did the store have to begin the day?
Choices:
  A: 80
  B: 120
  C: 240
  D: 320
  E: 360
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let y be the number of yellow balls to begin with, and w be the number of white balls to begin with.
We know that y + w = 600, and that the store sold 80% = 0.80 of its inventory. So, 0.80 * 600 = 480 golf balls were sold by the end of the day.
We also know that the store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls, which means they sold 240 white golf balls (since all the white balls were sold).
Therefore, y + 240 = 480, which means y = 240.

Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's say that the store had "x" number of yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

* The store sold 80% of its inventory of golf balls. Therefore, at the end of the day, the store had 20% of its inventory left.
* The store sold an equal number of yellow and white golf balls. Therefore, the store sold 50% of its yellow golf balls.
* The store was able to sell all of its white golf balls.
* Therefore, the store had 50% of its yellow golf balls left at the end of the day.

To come up with the answer we'll use algebra:
50% of x = 20% of 600
0.5x = 0.2 * 600
0.5x = 120
x = 240

Therefore, the store had 240 yellow golf balls at the beginning of the day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To solve the problem, first, we find out how many golf balls are sold, then calculate the number of white golf balls sold, and lastly, we find the number of yellow golf balls left. 

Action: Answer("C") 

Here is the solution: 

If 600 is the original stock, then 80% of 600 = 480 golf balls are sold.
Half of the total sold golf balls are white. So, the number of white golf balls sold is 480/2 = 240.
Since all the white golf balls are sold, then the remaining golf balls must be yellow, which is 360.

  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Let "x" be the length of the shorter piece of rope. Then the longer piece of rope is (x + 3) meters. The total length is 20. Therefore, we can create the following equation: 

x + (x+3) = 20

Simplifying the equation: 

2x + 3 = 20 

2x = 17 

x = 8.5 

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is (8.5 + 3) = 11.5 meters.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
The length of the shorter piece is then x-3.
The sum of the lengths of the two pieces is 20, so we can write an equation:

x + (x-3) = 20

Solving for x, we get:

2x-3 = 20

2x = 23

x = 11.5

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.
The length of the shorter piece of rope is x - 3.
The two lengths add up to 20:
x + (x - 3) = 20
Simplifying the above equation, we get:
2x = 23
x = 11.5
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let X be the length of the longer piece of rope. The length of the shorter piece of rope is X -3. We know that the sum of the length of the shorter piece of rope and the length of the longer piece of rope equal 20m. Then, we can set up the equation X + (X - 3) = 20. Solving for X, we get X = 11.5.

2x - 3 = 20
2x = 23
x = 11.5

Therefore, the length of the longer piece of rope is 11.5 meters.

Question: On a normal day Bill usually averages about 15 mph when riding his bicycle. On a windy day, his speed is reduced by 4 mph. How far can Bill travel on a windy day in 21 minutes? Round to the nearest hundredth.
Choices:
  A: 2 miles
  B: 2.25 miles
  C: 3.25 miles
  D: 3.85 miles
  E: 2.85 miles
Response 0:
First, we need to convert the time into hours (since the given speed is in miles per hour). 

21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours

Now, we can use the formula distance = speed x time, where the speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph (on a windy day) and the time is 0.35 hours:

distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles

Rounding to the nearest hundredth gives us:

3.85 ≈ 3.85

So the answer is D) 3.85 miles.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours, which is 0.35 hours.  
On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph  
We can use the formula: distance = rate x time  
So, distance = 11 mph x 0.35 h = 3.85 miles.  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 2:
First, we need to convert the time to hours:
21 minutes = 21/60 hours = 0.35 hours
On a windy day, Bill's speed is 15 - 4 = 11 mph
To find the distance he can travel: distance = speed x time
distance = 11 x 0.35 = 3.85 miles

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Calculating Bill's speed on a windy day, we get:

- Speed = 15mph - 4mph = 11mph

To find the distance he can travel in 21 minutes (0.35 hours), we can use the formula:

- Distance = Speed * Time

- Distance = 11mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To start, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 21 minutes is equal to 21/60 = 0.35 hours.
On a normal day, Bill averages 15 mph. So on a windy day, his speed is reduced to 15 - 4 = 11 mph.
To find how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 0.35 hours, we can use the formula distance = rate x time.
Therefore, distance = 11 mph x 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles.
So the answer is D: 3.85 miles.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We will use the formula: distance = rate x time. 

On a normal day, Bill can travel 15 miles in 60 minutes. Therefore, his rate can be converted to 0.25 miles per minute (15/60). 

On a windy day, his rate is reduced by 4 mph, which means he can now travel at a rate of 11 mph or 0.18333 miles per minute (11/60).

To find out how far Bill can travel on a windy day in 21 minutes, we will plug in the numbers:

distance = rate x time = 0.18333 x 21 = 3.85 miles (rounded to the nearest hundredth)

Therefore, the answer is D: 3.85 miles. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
First, we need to convert 21 minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour so:

21 minutes / 60 minutes in an hour = 0.35 hours

On a normal day, Bill covers:

15 mph * 0.35 hours = 5.25 miles

On a windy day, Bill’s speed is 15 mph - 4 mph = 11 mph. In 0.35 hours, travel distance is:

11 mph * 0.35 hours = 3.85 miles

We can start this problem by representing the ratio of red to green sweets as 3x to 4x, where x is a constant. We're also told that there are 120 green sweets, which means that 4x must equal 120. We can solve for x by dividing both sides by 4:

4x = 120
x = 30

Now that we know x, we can find the number of red sweets by multiplying 3x:

3x = 3(30) = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Solution: 

Let's use "x" to represent the number of red sweets. 

The ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4, which means that the total number of parts is 3+4=7. 

To find the number of red sweets, we need to figure out how many parts the 3 represents. 

We can set up a proportion: 

3/7 = x/120 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply: 

3 * 120 = 7 * x 

360 = 7x 

x = 51.42 (rounded to the nearest whole number) 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

Therefore, none of the choices provide the correct answer. The closest option to the correct answer is 95, but that is still not correct.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let x be the common ratio for the full bag.
The ratio of red : green sweets = 3 : 4
so the total number of sweets is split into 7 equal parts (3 + 4).
The number of green sweets is given as 120.
Therefore 4 parts = 120.
Hence, 1 part = 120/4 = 30.

The number of red sweets is 3 parts.
Therefore, the number of red sweets = 3 * 30 = 90.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To solve the problem, we need to use the ratio of red to green sweets. We know that the ratio of red sweets to green sweets is 3:4. This means that for every 3 red sweets, there are 4 green sweets.

We are given that there are 120 green sweets in the bag. To find the number of red sweets, we need to set up a proportion:

3/4 = x/120

where x is the number of red sweets.

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

4x = 3 * 120
4x = 360
x = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's begin with representing the ratio of red sweets to green sweets.
Let r be the number of red sweets in the bag.
According to the problem, 
red/green = 3/4
r/120 = 3/4

Now, we cross multiply and solve for r.
r = 120 x 3/4 = 90

Therefore, there are 90 red sweets in the bag.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
We can begin solving the problem by first finding the number of green sweets for every one red sweet in the bag using the ratio given: 

4 green sweets : 3 red sweets

We know that there are 120 green sweets in the bag, hence: 

4 green sweets / 1 red sweet = 120 green sweets / X red sweets

where X represents the number of red sweets.

Solving for X, we get: 

X = 120 green sweets * 3 red sweets / 4 green sweets 

X = 90 red sweets

Therefore, the answer is A: 90

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company produces 420 units of a particular computer component every month, at a production cost to the company of $110 per component, and sells all of the components by the end of each month. What is the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee that the yearly profit (revenue from sales minus production costs) will be at least $626,400 ?
Choices:
  A: 226
  B: 230
  C: 240
  D: 260
  E: 280
Response 0:
First, let's determine the annual production cost:
The monthly production cost is: 420 * 110 = $46,200
So the annual production cost is: 12 * 46,200 = $554,400

To achieve a yearly profit of $626,400 the company needs to make a revenue of: 626,400 + 554,400 = $1,180,800

The company produces 420 units every month, for a total of 420 * 12 = 5,040 units per year.

To calculate the minimum selling price per component, we can use the formula: (Revenue - Cost) / Units = Minimum Selling Price per Component

Plugging in the values, we get: (1,180,800 - 554,400) / 5,040 = $119.21

So the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $119.21, which is not one of the available choices. Therefore, the most likely answer would be choice C: 240.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
First, we need to calculate the yearly production cost:  
420 units/month x $110/unit x 12 months/year = $554,400/year  

To find the minimum selling price that will guarantee a yearly profit of $626,400, we can use the following equation:  
(yearly selling price per unit) x (420 units/month x 12 months/year) - $554,400 ≥ $626,400  

Simplifying this equation:  
(yearly selling price per unit) x 5,040 - $554,400 ≥ $626,400  
(yearly selling price per unit) x 5,040 ≥ $1,180,800  
(yearly selling price per unit) ≥ $1,180,800 ÷ 5,040  
(yearly selling price per unit) ≥ $234.13  

Since we need the minimum selling price per component and not the yearly selling price per component, we divide both sides by 420:  
(minimum selling price per component) = $234.13 ÷ 420 ≈ $0.557  

Converting this to cents: $0.557 x 100 = 55.7 cents.  

Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee a yearly profit of at least $626,400 is $0.557 or 55.7 cents.  

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's start by computing the annual revenue. The total number of units produced per year is 12 x 420 = 5,040. Since all of the components are sold, the annual revenue is the price per unit multiplied by the number of units produced, or 5,040 x P, where P is the selling price per unit. 
The annual production cost is 5,040 x $110 = $554,400. We want the annual profit to be at least $626,400, so we have:
Annual revenue - Annual production cost >= $626,400
5,040P - $554,400 >= $626,400
5,040P >= $1,180,800
P >= $1,180,800 / 5,040
P >= $234.13, which is closest to $240.
Therefore, the minimum selling price per component that will guarantee an annual profit of at least $626,400 is $240. 
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, calculate the total production cost for one year:  
Production cost per component = $110  
Number of components produced in a year = 420 * 12 = 5040  
Total production cost for a year = 110 * 5040 = $554,400  

Now, add the required yearly profit to the total production cost to get the minimum yearly revenue:  
Required yearly profit = $626,400  
Minimum yearly revenue = $626,400 + $554,400 = $1,180,800  

Finally, divide the minimum yearly revenue by the number of components produced in a year to find the minimum selling price:  
Minimum selling price per component = $1,180,800 / 5040 = $234  

Action: Answer("None of the above")  
As the given choices do not include $234, the answer would be None of the Above.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
First, let's find the annual production cost: 

$110/component * 420 components/month * 12 months/year = $554,400/year

We want to make at least $626,400 profit per year, so adding the production cost gives us the annual revenue needed:

$626,400/year + $554,400/year = $1,180,800/year

To find the minimum sale price per component, we can divide the needed annual revenue by the number of components produced per year:

$1,180,800/year ÷ (420 components/month * 12 months/year) = $230/component

Choices:
  A: 40
  B: 62
  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
We can setup the equation k(-50 + (-50 + 1) + ... + (-50 + k - 1)) = 51. Simplifying gives us k(-25 + k) = 51. Rearranging and simplifying further leads to the quadratic equation k^2 - 25k + 51 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, we get k = (25 ± √601)/2. The only positive integer solution is k = (25 + √601)/2 ≈ 24.7 which rounds up to 25. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Let's call the number of consecutive integers "k". 

Since the least of the k consecutive integers is -50, we can say that the first integer in the sequence is -50. 

The sum of k consecutive integers starting from -50 can be found using the formula: 
sum = (first number + last number) * k/2

If the least integer is -50, then the last integer would be (-50 + (k-1)) = (-50 + k - 1) = (k-51)

Plugging in the values we know to the formula: 
51 = (-50 + (k-51) ) * k/2 

Simplifying: 
51 = (-101 + k) * k/2 
102 = -101 + k^2 
k^2 = 203 
k = sqrt(203) 

This is not one of the answer choices. However, we can approximate the value of k to the nearest integer using 14^2 = 196 and 15^2 = 225, therefore k is between 14 and 15. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice would be: 

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

(Note: If I had to choose the most likely answer from the given choices, I would choose D: 92 since it is the closest to the approximate value of k)
Response 4:
We can set up an equation to solve this problem. Let x be the first of the k consecutive integers, then the next integer will be x+1, and so on, up to x+k-1, which is the last integer in the k consecutive integers. 

The sum of the k consecutive integers is given to be 51, so we have:

x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51

Since x is the least integer in the k consecutive integers and is given to be -50, we can substitute -50 for x in the equation:

-50 + (-50+1) + (-50+2) + ... + (-50+k-1) = 51

Simplifying this expression gives:

k(-50) + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51

We can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to simplify the second term:

1+2+...+(k-1) = (k-1)k/2

Substituting this into the equation and simplifying gives:

k(-50) + (k-1)k/2 = 51

Multiplying both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction gives:

2k(-50) + k(k-1) = 102

Expanding and simplifying the left side gives:

-100k + k^2 - k = 102

Simplifying further gives:

k^2 - 101k + 102 = 0

We can factor this quadratic equation as:

(k-1)(k-100) = 0

The solutions are k=1 and k=100, but since we are looking for a sum of consecutive integers greater than 1, the answer is k=100.

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
First start by identifying the dimensions of the rectangle. 

Let L be the length of the painted sides and W be the length of the unpainted side. 

Since there are three painted sides, we can say: 

2L + W = 37 

Since the unpainted side is 9, we can also say: 

W = 9 

Substituting that into the earlier equation: 

2L + 9 = 37 

2L = 28 

L = 14 

So the dimensions of the rectangle are 14 x 9. 

To find the area, simply multiply the two dimensions: 

14 x 9 = 126 

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("C") 126.
Response 2:
Let's start by identifying the dimensions of the rectangle. The painted area consists of two sides with length L and one side with width W. By the given information, we have the following equations:

2L + W = 37   
W = 9  

Substituting W in the first equation, we have:

2L + 9 = 37  
2L = 28  
L = 14  

Thus, the rectangle has length 14 feet and width 9 feet. Its area is:

A = L x W = 14 x 9 = 126  

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Solution:
Let's assume that the length of the parking space is l and the width is w (in feet).
Given that one side(width) of the parking is unpainted. So, the length of the parking = 9 + w.
Also, given that the sum of the length of painted sides = 37 feet. So, we can set up the equation as:
l + w + l = 37 
2l + w = 37
l = (37 - w)/2
Now, we can substitute the value of l in the area formula l*w to get the area of the parking space in square feet.
Area = l * w
Area = (37 - w)/2 * w
Area = (37w - w^2)/2
Area = (-1/2)(w^2 - 37w)
Area = (-1/2)(w^2 - 37w + (37/2)^2) + (37/2)^2
Area = (-1/2)(w - 37/2)^2 + 1369/4
The maximum value of (-1/2)(w - 37/2)^2 is 0, which occurs when w = 37/2.
Therefore, the maximum area of the parking space is (1369/4) sq. ft, which is approximately equal to 342.25 sq. ft.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find the area of the parking space, first we need to find the length and the width of the rectangle. 

We know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so either the length or the width of the rectangle is 9 feet. 

Let's assume that the width is 9 feet, then the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 - 2(9) = 19 feet, which means that the length is (19 - 9) / 2 = 5 feet. 

Therefore, the area of the parking space is 5 x 9 = 45 square feet.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the perimeter of the rectangle, which is the sum of all four sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, then the sum of the painted sides is 37 - 9 = 28 feet. We know that two of the painted sides are equal in length, so we can divide 28 by 2 to get the length of one of the painted sides: 28/2 = 14 feet. 

The length of the rectangle is the sum of two adjacent sides, one painted and one unpainted: 9 + 14 = 23 feet. The width of the rectangle is the length of the remaining unpainted side: 9 feet. 

To find the area of the rectangle, we can multiply the length and the width: 23 * 9 = 207 square feet. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
First, we need to find the width of the parking space. Let's call it w.
We know that 2L + w = 37, where L is the length of the parking space.
We also know that L + w + 9 = A, where A is the area of the parking space.
Solving for w in the first equation, we get w = 37 - 2L.
Substituting into the second equation, we get L + (37 - 2L) + 9 = A, which simplifies to L - 2L + A = 46, or A = L + 46.
We need to find L to find A. From the first equation, we know that L = (37 - w)/2 = (37 - (37 - 2L))/2 = L.
Therefore, L = 9.25 and A = L + 46 = 55.25.
So the area of the parking space is 55.25 square feet.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Let's start by using the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: 

Perimeter = 2 (length + width)

We know that the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet. Since we know that 3 sides have been painted, there are only 2 sides left to account for the unpainted side and another side X. Thus:

length + width + X = 37/2

We also know that the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet. Therefore, by substitution:

9 + width + X = 37/2
width + X = 19/2

Finally, we want to find the area of the rectangle. We know that:

Area = length x width

We also know that:

length + width = 37/2 - X

Substitute width + X = 19/2:

length = 37/2 - X - (19/2 - X) = 9 - X

Substitute length = 9 - X:

Area = length x width
Area = (9 - X)(X)
Area = 9X - X^2

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of X that gives the maximum result. We can do this by completing the square, which will give us:

Area = -1(X^2 - 9X - (-81/4) + 81/4)
Area = -1(X - 9/2)^2 + 81/4

This is a parabolic equation with a maximum value at X = 9/2. Hence:

We know the width is 100 feet and the area is 3,000 square feet. So we can set up the equation:
3,000 = length * 100
To solve for length, we will divide both sides by 100:
length = 3,000/100
length = 30 feet

Therefore, the length of the other side of the yard is 30 feet.

Question: In a large forest, 300 deer were caught, tagged, and returned during 2001. During 2002, 500 deer were caught at random, of which only 20 had tags from the previous year. If the percent of deer in the forest that had tags during the second year and were caught in the 500 deer sample is representative of the percent of the total deer population in the forest with tags, what is the total deer population in the forest (assuming no change in population between 2001 and 2002)?
Choices:
  A: 300
  B: 500
  C: 5000
  D: 6000
  E: 7500
Response 0:
Solution: 

Of the 300 tagged deer from 2001, 300/500 or 3/5 are assumed to remain in the woods and be part of the population the next year. Let P be the total deer population, so that (P)(3/5) deer are tagged. 

Additionally, there are 500 deer caught the following year, with 20 tagged, so the percent of tagged deer in the sample is (20/500) or 1/25. According to the problem, this value is representative of the percent of the total deer population with tags, which is (P)(3/5) deer. 

Putting these pieces together, we can write the equation: 
(1/25)P = (3/5)P

Solving for P: 
(1/25)P = (3/5)P
Multiply both sides by 25: 
P = (25)(3/5)P 
P = 15P 
Subtract P from both sides: 
0 = 14P 
Divide both sides by 14: 
P = 0 

Therefore, there is an error in the problem since the population cannot be zero. None of the answer choices provided is correct.

Question: On dividing 2272 and 875 by a 3-digit number N, we get the same remainder. The sum of the digits of N is:
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 11
  C: 12
  D: 13
  E: 14
Response 0:
We are looking for a 3-digit number N that divides both 2272 and 875 leaving the same remainder. 

First, we find the difference between 2272 and 875: 

    2272 - 875 = 1397 

We know that N divides 1397 leaving the same remainder. To find N, we need to try different divisors of 1397. We start with 100 (the smallest 3-digit number) and move up:

    1397 ÷ 100 = 13 R 97
    1397 ÷ 101 = 13 R 84
    1397 ÷ 102 = 13 R 71
    1397 ÷ 103 = 13 R 58
    1397 ÷ 104 = 13 R 45
    1397 ÷ 105 = 13 R 32
    1397 ÷ 106 = 13 R 19
    1397 ÷ 107 = 13 R 6

We see that 1397 leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 107. 

Now, we need to check that 2272 and 875 also leave a remainder of 6 when divided by 107:

    2272 ÷ 107 = 21 R 25
    875 ÷ 107 = 8 R 31

So, 107 is indeed the number we are looking for. 

Finally, we add up the digits of N: 

    1 + 0 + 7 = 8 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the above") 

(Note: None of the above is the best answer since 8 is not one of the choices given. The closest answer is E: 14. However, there is a mistake in the question as the digits of N should add up to 5, which would correspond to choice A: 10.)

Response 8:
The answer to this question can be found by using the concept of remainders. If two numbers have the same remainder when divided by a third number, then their difference must be divisible by that third number. We can start by calculating the difference between 2272 and 875:

2272 - 875 = 1397

We know that N must divide into 1397 with no remainder, and that N is a 3-digit number. To find the sum of the digits of N, we need to first find the factors of 1397 (excluding 1 and 1397). We can do this by dividing 1397 by each number from 2 to 40 (which is approximately the square root of 1397).

1397 ÷ 2 = 698 R 1
1397 ÷ 3 = 465 R 2
1397 ÷ 4 = 349 R 1
1397 ÷ 5 = 279 R 2
1397 ÷ 6 = 232 R 5
1397 ÷ 7 = 199 R 6
1397 ÷ 8 = 174 R 5
1397 ÷ 9 = 155 R 2
1397 ÷ 10 = 139 R 7
1397 ÷ 11 = 127 R 0
1397 ÷ 12 = 116 R 5
1397 ÷ 13 = 107 R 6
1397 ÷ 14 = 99 R 13
1397 ÷ 15 = 93 R 2
1397 ÷ 16 = 87 R 5
1397 ÷ 17 = 82 R 11
1397 ÷ 18 = 77 R 11
1397 ÷ 19 = 73 R 0
1397 ÷ 20 = 69 R 17
1397 ÷ 21 = 66 R 11
1397 ÷ 22 = 63 R 11
1397 ÷ 23 = 60 R 17
1397 ÷ 24 = 58 R 5
1397 ÷ 25 = 55 R 22
1397 ÷ 26 = 53 R 15
1397 ÷ 27 = 51 R 20
1397 ÷ 28 = 49 R 21
1397 ÷ 29 = 48 R 25
1397 ÷ 30 = 46 R 17
1397 ÷ 31 = 45 R 22
1397 ÷ 32 = 43 R 29
1397 ÷ 33 = 42 R 11
1397 ÷ 34 = 41 R 23
1397 ÷ 35 = 39 R 22
1397 ÷ 36 = 38 R 29
1397 ÷ 37 = 37 R 26
1397 ÷ 38 = 36 R 25
1397 ÷ 39 = 35 R 22
1397 ÷ 40 = 34 R 37

We can see that the only factor of 1397 that is a 3-digit number is 19. When we divide both 2272 and 875 by 19, we get the same remainder of 13.

2272 ÷ 19 = 119 R 13
875 ÷ 19 = 45 R 13

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.
Choices:
  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A") - 368  
Solution: Let's call the hundreds digit "a", the tens digit "b", and the units digit "c". From the problem statement, we have:

a + b + c = 17 ------------(1)
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109 ----- (2)

From (1)
c = 17 - a - b

substituting c into (2):
a^2 + b^2 + (17 - a - b)^2 = 109
Expanding terms, we get:
2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2ab - 34a - 34b + 210 = 0

Rearranging terms:
(a - 17)^2 + (b - 17)^2 = 37

We can only have integers for (a - 17) and (b - 17) that satisfy the above equation and are less than or equal to 9. One such pair that works is (a - 17) = -2 and (b - 17) = 6; this gives us a=15 and b=23, and c = -21. However, c must be positive, so we go back to equation (1) and experiment until we find that a=3, b=6, and c=8. This gives us the original number as: 368. 

Finally, we can check that 368-495 = 863 (the digits written in reverse) by seeing that 5-9=-4, 6-4= 2, and 3-5 = -2. Since we are dealing with integers we have to remember the "borrowing" step. Thus 863 is the number that we get when we subtract 495 from 368 written in reverse.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To solve this problem systematically, we need to use algebraic equations. Let the three digit number be $abc$, written in expanded form as $100a+10b+c$. Then we are given that:

$a+b+c=17$
$a^2+b^2+c^2=109$
$100a+10b+c-495=100c+10b+a$

Simplifying the third equation, we can rewrite it as:

$99a-99c=495$

We can divide both sides by 99 to get:

$a-c=5$

We now have a system of equations in three variables $a$, $b$, and $c$. One way to solve this system is to use the third equation to get an expression for $c$ in terms of $a$ and $b$. Rearranging the equation:

$100a+9b=100c+495$

Substituting $a-c=5$:

$100(c+5)+9b=100c+495$

Simplifying:

$9b=495-500$

$9b=-5$

This leads to a contradiction, since $b$ is a digit between 0 and 9. Therefore, there is no three digit number that satisfies all of the given conditions.

Response 4:
Let's use the formula:  
Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit  
Where "Profit" is given as 20% of Cost Price and "Selling Price" is given as Rs. 360. 

Using the above formula, we obtain:  
360 = Cost Price + 0.2*Cost Price  
360 = Cost Price (1 + 0.2)  
Cost Price = 360/1.2 = 300

Response 9:
To solve the problem, we can use the formula:
Selling Price = Cost Price + Profit
Given, Selling Price =Rs.360 and Profit = 20% of Cost Price
Let's assume Cost Price to be x
Therefore, Selling Price = x+20% of x = 1.2x
So, we can form the equation: 1.2x = 360
Solving for x gives the Cost Price as x = (360/1.2) = Rs. 300.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's start by breaking down the information provided in the problem.
Let's call the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Monday as "x". 
Since the hotel orders twice as many papers on Sunday as it does the rest of the week, it will order 2x newspapers on Sunday.
The cost per week for newspapers is $210. Using this information, we can create an equation:

2(4) + x(1) * 6 = 210

Simplifying this equation, we get:

8 + 6x = 210
6x = 202
x = 33.67

Since we cannot buy a fractional number of newspapers, we need to round down to the nearest integer. Therefore, the hotel buys 33 newspapers on Monday.

  E: 59
Response 0:
Let x be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it.
We know that the number of lilies doubles every two days. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
1 * 2^(60/2) = 64 * 2^(x/2)
Simplifying the equation, we get:
2^30 = 2^(6+x/2)
30 = 6 + x/2
x/2 = 24
x = 48

Response 6:
Let X be the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it. 

After two days, there will be 64*2 = 128 water lilies.
After four days, there will be 128*2 = 256 water lilies.
We can derive a general formula: Number of water lilies = (Initial number of lilies) * 2^(days/2)

Using this formula, we get:
64*2^(X/2) = 2^(60/2)
2^(X/2 + 6) = 2^30
X/2 + 6 = 30
X/2 = 24
X = 48

Therefore, the lake will be fully covered with lilies after 48 days.

Response 5:
First we notice that the perimeter of a Rectangle is P = 2(L+W), where L and W are Length and Width. We also know that one of the dimensions, Width or Length, is 340/2 - 2 = 168, and the other, with boundary, is (340-4)/2 = 168. Therefore, the area of the rectangle is 168 * 168, and the area of the garden (the rectangle with side lengths reduced by 2, all around) is (168-2) * (168-2). The cost of gardening is $10 per square metre, so we multiply the area of the garden by 10.

Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360

Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D") - 360. 

Here's the explanation: Let's say the distance between A and B is "x" miles. Kevin's drive from A to B took him x/70 hours, with the speed of 70 mph. It took him the same amount of time to drive back from B to A at the speed of 90 mph. Therefore, we know the entire duration of Kevin's trip was 2x/70 + 2x/90 hours.

We also know that Kevin was 70 miles away from point B exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip. Since we know his speed and distance, we can calculate that it took him 70/70 = 1 hour to travel that 70 miles. Therefore, 1 hour + 3 hours = 4 hours is the time it took him to travel from 70 miles before point B to point B and then back to the same 70 mile point (including his pause).

Using the formula above, we can set up an equation: 2x/70 + 2x/90 = T - 4 (where T is the total duration of his trip). We can then simplify the equation by finding a common denominator and combining like terms:

18x/630 + 14x/630 = T - 4
32x/630 = T - 4
x = (T - 4) * 630/32

Now we need to find T. We know that T - 3 = 2x/90, so T = 2x/90 + 3. We can substitute this value in the equation above and simplify:

x = ((2x/90 + 3) - 4) * 630/32
x = 9 * 630/32
x = 360

Therefore, the distance between A and B is 360 miles.

Question: A man divides Rs 8600 among 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews. If each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, and each son receives five as much as each nephew. How much does each daughter receive ?
Choices:
  A: Rs 400
  B: Rs 500
  C: Rs 600
  D: Rs 700
  E: Rs 800
Response 0:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Each daughter receives four times as much as each nephew, then each daughter receives 4x amount. Each son receives five times as much as each nephew, then each son receives 5x amount.
Therefore, the total share of nephews = 2x
the total share of 5 sons = 5(5x) = 25x
the total share of 4 daughters = 4(4x) = 16x
The total amount of 5 sons, 4 daughters and 2 nephews = 8600
Then, 2x + 25x +16x = 8600
Or, 43x = 8600
Or, x = 200
So, the share of each daughter = 4x = 4 × 200 = 800
Hence, each daughter receives Rs 800.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Let x be the amount of each nephew. Then each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 
The total number of shares is 5+4+2 = 11. Therefore, 
5x + 4(4x) + 2x = 8600. 
This simplifies to 21x = 8600. 
So, x = 400. 
Each daughter receives 4x = Rs 1600.
 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let the share of each nephew be x.
Then, the share of each daughter = 4x and share of each son = 5x
Total number of shares = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11
Therefore, x = total amount / 11 = 8600 / 11

So, the share of each daughter = (4 x 8600) / (11 x 4) = Rs. 800

Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
First, let's find the total number of people who are receiving the money: 

5 sons + 4 daughters + 2 nephews = 11 total people.

Let X be the amount that each nephew receives. 

Each daughter would receive 4X, and each son would receive 5X. 

The total amount of money distributed is equal to X(2+4+5*5+4*4) = 8600. 

Simplifying the equation, we get 25X = 8600. 

Thus, X = 344. 

Therefore, each daughter would receive 4X, which is equal to Rs. 1,376.

Response 5:

Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let x be the amount each nephew receives. Then, each daughter receives 4x and each son receives 5x. 

The total number of people receiving the money is 5+4+2=11. 

The sum of the amounts received by each person is:
5 * 5x + 4 * 4x + 2 * x = 8600 

Simplifying the equation:
25x + 16x + 2x = 8600 
43x = 8600 
x = 200 

Therefore, each daughter receives 4x = Rs 800.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Let the share of each nephew be x. Then,
The share of each daughter = 4x
The share of each son = 5x

Total number of people = 5+4+2 = 11

Total amount = 5*(5x) + 4*(4x) + 2x = 25x + 16x + 2x = Rs 43x

So, 43x = 8600
x = 200

Hence, each daughter will receive = 4x = 4*200 = Rs 800

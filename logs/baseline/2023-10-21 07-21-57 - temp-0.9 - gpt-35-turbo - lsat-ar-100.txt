Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Since three students review Undulation, the other two students must review either Sunset or Tamerlane. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the two students who review the same play or plays as each other must be reviewing Sunset. 

The information that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, means that Jiang must be one of the students who reviewed Sunset. 

Therefore, Jiang and two other students reviewed Undulation, which means that Megregian did not review Undulation. 

This leaves O'Neill and Lopez, who reviewed Sunset and Tamerlane, respectively. 

Action: Answer("B") - O'Neill does not review Undulation.

Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
To satisfy the given conditions:
- If Ryan is assigned, Onyx must be assigned immediately prior to Ryan's, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1922 and Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
- And if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned, Louis, Mollie, and Tiffany are ruled out since the remaining two years are 1921 and 1924.

Given the above constraint, the only possible assignment is Yoshio being assigned to 1921 and Mollie or Tiffany being assigned to 1924. However, no option in the choices presents 1924 as an option. Therefore, the answer is:

Response 2:
The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Since the shoe store is in space 2, we know that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7. Also, we know that one of the restaurants must be in space 1 or space 7. 

Action: Answer("D") - The toy store is in space 6, which means the veterinarian cannot be in space 5 or space 7. This implies that the veterinarian must be in space 3, which means a restaurant must be in space 1. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the other restaurant must be in space 5. The optometrist and the pharmacy must be located next to each other, so the optometrist must be in space 1 and the pharmacy in space 2. This leaves space 4 for the shoe store.

Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.

Response 3:

Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
If the watercolors lecture is third, it means that the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture must both be later than the watercolors lecture.
Action: Answer("D") since if Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then he must give it before both Garcia's and Jiang's lecture, which satisfies the given constraints.
Response 6:
If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures must start either with oil paintings or sculptures. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture and Garcia must give the second one. Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture since it would make him give the last lecture, which is not possible. Jiang must give the lithographs lecture last, and as a result, he will give the fourth lecture. Hence, the only valid option is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. Answer("D")

Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")  
If Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2 and Franz's oil is on wall 3, the only painting that can be on wall 1 is Greene's oil. This is because Greene's watercolor is paired with Franz's oil, and Isaacs cannot have a painting displayed on the same wall as Franz. Hidalgo's paintings could potentially be on walls 3 and 4, while Franz's watercolor and Hidalgo's watercolor could potentially be on wall 2.

To satisfy the conditions given, the painting displayed on Wall 1 cannot be by Franz or Isaacs. Also, it cannot be Hidalgo's watercolor. Therefore, Greene's oil and Hidalgo's oil are the only options left. But since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, it means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on Wall 1.

Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
First, we know that Frost must be assigned with Heideck, so they must both be assigned to the same ceremony. Then, we know that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, and we can eliminate choices A and B. Next, we know that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This means that Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, and we can eliminate choice C. Finally, we know that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so they cannot both be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, and we can eliminate choice E. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Heideck, Lai.

Response 9:
After applying the constraints, the possible combinations of photographers for the Silva University Ceremony are Frost + Heideck + Lai or Frost + Heideck + Mays. Since option A has Knutson instead of Lai or Mays, it is not a possible combination. Option B has three photographers, so it cannot be a complete assignment. Option C has only two photographers, so it cannot be a complete assignment either. Option D has two photographers, Heideck and Lai, but it is missing at least one more photographer. Option E has two photographers, Knutson and Mays, but it is missing at least one more photographer. Therefore, the answer is:

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
First, we can try to figure out who works in Zone 2:
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Therefore, the other one of Tiao or Udall must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- But Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, so Udall must work in Zone 3.
- Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.

Now we can look at the options:
- A: Kim works in Zone 2. This cannot be true since we already know Tiao works in Zone 2.
- B: Mahr works in Zone 2. This cannot be true since we already know Tiao works in Zone 2 and there is only one sales representative working in each zone.
- C: Parra works in Zone 3. This could be true. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. That would leave Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey to work in Zone 1, which satisfies the condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
- D: Tiao works in Zone 1. This cannot be true since we already know Tiao works in Zone 2.
- E: Udall works in Zone 3. This could be true, and we already showed the scenario where this is the case.

Therefore, the answer is either C or E. However, since we are asked to select the most likely answer if we think the answer is "none of the above", we can select Answer("C").
Response 1:
Checking the given conditions,
Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1:  Parra/Tiao in Zone 1
Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2: Tiao/Udall in Zone 2
Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other: Parra and Quinn in same zone
Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other: Stuckey and Udall in same zone
There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Let's consider each option:
A: Kim works in Zone 2. - If Kim is working in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work with either parra or Quinn which violates the given condition. Hence Option A is not true.
B: Mahr works in Zone 2. - Same as Option A, if Mahr is in Zone 2, it violates the given conditions. Hence Option B is not true. 
C: Parra works in Zone 3. - If Parra works in Zone 3, then neither Tiao nor Udall can be in Zone 1 or 2, which means there would be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is consistent with the given condition. Hence Option C could be true. 
D: Tiao works in Zone 1. - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot be in Zone 1 and there would be no one left to fulfill the conditions for Zone 3. Hence Option D is not true. 
E: Udall works in Zone 3. - If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey has to be in Zone 3 as well, and Parra and Tiao would have to be in Zone 1 and 2, although it's not mentioned which one is in which, there would be at least one sales representative in Zone 1 and two in Zone 2, which is not consistent with the given condition. Hence Option E is not true.

Therefore, the answer is Option C: Parra works in Zone 3. 
Response 2:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
From the given conditions, we know that if more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then only one sales representative can work in Zone 2. Also, since either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, it means that the remaining sales representative that doesn't work in Zone 1 or Zone 2 must work in Zone 3. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, it means that at most two sales representatives work in Zone 3, which implies that at least four sales representatives work in Zone 1. From the given choices, the only one that satisfies this condition is:

Action: Answer("D") Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 4:
From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. From these two conditions, it follows that either Parra or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 3.

If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it must be the case that only one sales representative works in Zone 3. From the above deduction, we know that either Parra or Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, it must be the case that the other person works in Zone 1. This means that Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, leaving only two options: Mahr works in Zone 2 or Udall works in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Hence, Tiao must work in Zone 2. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, only one person can work in Zone 2. So, Kim cannot work in Zone 2. Parra works in Zone 1. Since Parra works in the same sales zone as Quinn, Quinn also works in Zone 1. Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey. Hence, Udall and Stuckey work in Zone 3. So, more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 1. Therefore, the only possible choice is Answer("E") Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 7:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it follows that either two or three people work in Zone 1 and one or two people work in Zone 2. Given the given conditions, one possible arrangement is that Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1 while Tiao works in Zone 2. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions and allows for more sales representatives to work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D") - Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 8:
The given information tells us that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. Also, Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra must be working in Zone 1, and Tiao must be working in Zone 2. This means Udall must be working in Zone 3 with either Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey. We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey must also be working in Zone 3. It is not given that Mahr or Kim work in Zone 3, so the only possible answer is:

Action: Answer("C") Parra works in Zone 3.
Response 9:
By given conditions: 
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("C") -> If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Parra could work in Zone 3.

Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
If M is published in the fall, K, N, and O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 1:
If M is published in the fall, the only cookbook that can be published in the same season as M is N. As per the given conditions, K is the only cookbook that can be published in the same season as N. So, if M is published in the fall, K and N must be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 2:
If M is published in the fall, K and 0 must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the answer is A: K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
If M is published in the fall, then according to the constraints, N must be published in spring. Therefore, the only option that is possible is K and O. Hence, 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall. 

By the conditions given, M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall. 

If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. But K cannot be published in the fall if N is published in the spring. Therefore, K and O cannot both be published in the fall if M is published in the fall.

This leaves us with only one pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M:

Action: Answer("C") - L and O.
Response 5:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall. Since K and N must be published in the same season as each other, N must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 6:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 7:
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, if M is published in the fall, then K, O, L, and P must be published in the fall. So the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("C"): L and O.
Response 8:
Since M is published in the fall, based on the condition that "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring", we know that N must be in the spring season. Therefore, the only pair that can be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
If M is published in the fall, then we know that N must be published in the spring. Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.

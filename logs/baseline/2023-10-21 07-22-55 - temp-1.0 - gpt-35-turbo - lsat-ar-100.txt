Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
From the given conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neil both review Tamerlane. Also, the answer choice must contain exactly two students. So the correct answer would be:

Action: Answer("B") - Kramer, O'Neill
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
From the conditions given, we know that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane and exactly two students must review the same play or plays. Therefore, Answer("B"): Kramer, O'Neill, is the only plausible option.
Response 5:
The following must be true: Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Because of this, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane. Also, because Kramer/Lopez/Megregian all review some subset of the plays, this means at most two students can review Tamerlane. Therefore, the only possible answer is:

Also, since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, then the other restaurant cannot be in spaces 3 or 4. Therefore, it must be located at space 7. Since the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and we know the pharmacy is already next to the shoe store, then either the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3. However, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 4. This means the veterinarian must be in space 5. Therefore, the answer is:

The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Before answering, I need to determine which lab assistants could lead the morning and afternoon sessions on Wednesday and Friday. Given the constraints:

- On Wednesday morning, either Julio or Olivia can lead the session.
- On Wednesday afternoon, either Nessa or Rebecca can lead the session.
- On Thursday morning, either Lan or Kevin can lead the session.
- On Thursday afternoon, either Julio or Olivia can lead the session.
- On Friday morning, either Lan or Kevin can lead the session.
- On Friday afternoon, either Nessa or Rebecca can lead the session.

Given this, if Kevin's session meets the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's on Friday afternoon. The lab assistants who lead those sessions are Kevin and Rebecca. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on Thursday afternoon. Julio cannot lead the Friday afternoon session because his session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, the answer is B: Kevin, Rebecca.

To form the panel of five scientists we need at least one of each of the three types. If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then one of the remaining scientist must be a botanist because there can be at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected. 

If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected. But, K and M cannot both be selected. Hence, F must be selected. 

So the panel will consist of F and two others - a botanist and either a chemist or a zoologist. If M is not selected, then K must be selected; if K is not selected then M must be selected. If M is selected, then P and R must also be selected.

The only common sales representative between the two lists (Zone 1 and Zone 3) is Tiao. Hence, the answer must include Tiao as the representative in Zone 3 that is not in Zone 2. Thus, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.

Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?

  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue

Response 2:
Action: Answer("B") # If Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Ruiz must lead the project, and they can both be project members. Therefore, at least one of them must be a project member, and the only answer choice among them is Ruiz. The other answer choices are not necessarily project members.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")  
If Taylor is not a project member and Smith is not a project member, then Wells has to be a project member because someone has to have Wells on their team. This means that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be on the team, so Quinn has to be the team leader and that leaves Xue. However, if Smith is a project member, then Taylor has to be a project member and, based on the constraints, this makes Ruiz the project leader, which means that they are also on the project team. If this is the case, then the answer is Ruiz.

Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Based on the constraints given, Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University ceremony then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, we can rule out options C, D, and E. 
The remaining options with Frost and Heideck assigned together are A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson and B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 
However, if we assign Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to Silva University ceremony on option A, that leaves only Knutson and Lai available for Thorne University ceremony, which does not satisfy the condition that Lai and Mays cannot both be assigned to the same ceremony. Therefore, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to Silva University ceremony is option B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
After applying the given constraints, the possible assignments of photographers to the Silva University ceremony are:
- Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
- Frost, Gonzalez, Lai
- Frost, Lai, Mays
- Frost, Mays, Heideck

Therefore, the answer is Action: Answer("B") Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Response 5:
After analyzing the constraints, there are only two photographers left to be assigned for the Silva University ceremony. Frost and Gonzalez must be assigned to the same ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony without Frost. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Thus, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony could be: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

If 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and 1 is by Hue, given that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section, and that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, the only possible combination is: 
- Lifestyle: Fuentes, Hue

- Sports: Hue, Fuentes or Fuentes, Hue

Therefore, Answer("A") Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, is NOT a possible combination. 

The remaining answer choices are all possible combinations, therefore the most likely answer is "none of the above". Therefore, Answer("E") Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, is the selected answer.

Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the possible distribution of sales representatives is as follows: Zone 1 (2 reps), Zone 2 (1 rep), and Zone 3 (4 reps). Given the conditions, we can infer that Parra works in Zone 3 (since Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and neither works in Zone 1). Thus, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2. In this case, at most 2 sales representatives can work in Zone 1. 
- Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 2 as two sales representatives can work in Zone 1, at most.
- Parra can work in Zone 3; Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 in this case.
- Udall can work in Zone 3.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Given that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2 and More sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. So, Zone 1 must have at least 3 representatives, which implies that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Also, as either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, they cannot work in Zone 1 or 3. Hence, there must be at least one representative in Zone 2. Therefore, we can conclude that only Option D: Tiao works in Zone 1 could be true. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because he/she works in Zone 1 or works in the same sales zone as Quinn and we don't have any information about Quinn's working zone, therefore Parra must work in Zone 1. Since Tiao doesn't work in Zone 1 he/she works in Zone 2. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, therefore we can infer that two representatives work in Zone 2 and three work in Zone 3. Because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, one of them must work in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3 as there is no more space for the 7th sales representative in Zone 2 or Zone 1, however, we cannot confirm if Kim works in Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore:

Action: Answer("B") (Mahr works in Zone 2.)
Response 4:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 representatives in Zone 1, 2 in Zone 2, and 2 in Zone 3. 

Action: Answer("D") - Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 5:
Based on the given conditions, we can determine that:
- If either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other person works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
- If either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then the other person works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and we don't know which zone that is.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, and we don't know which zone that is.
- There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then:
- Parra cannot work in Zone 1, because if he did, then Tiao would have to work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3, and there would be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1 (one of Parra/Tiao and one of the Stuckey/Udall pair).
- Tiao must work in Zone 1, because if he didn't, then Parra would have to work in Zone 1, which is not possible (see above).
- Udall must work in Zone 3, because if he didn't, then Tiao would have to work in Zone 3, which is not possible (see above).
- Stuckey must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3 (with Udall), because if he worked in Zone 2, then Mahr and Kim would have to work in Zone 3, which would violate the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
- Therefore, the sales representatives in each zone must be:
  - Zone 1: Tiao, Stuckey
  - Zone 2: Kim, Mahr
  - Zone 3: Parra, Quinn, Udall

The only choice that could be true is Answer("D"): Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 6:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 1 or Zone 2, and thus they must work in Zone 3. Therefore, it is possible that Tiao works in Zone 1, satisfying the condition that more representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. So, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Given that:
- Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
- Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
- There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the sales representatives currently assigned to Zone 3 are Udall and Stuckey, while the representative assigned to Zone 2 is either Tiao or Udall. From the conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, which means the maximum number of representatives in Zone 3 is two. Therefore, we must have more representatives assigned to Zone 1 than to Zone 3. This condition means that only choice D is possible for the representatives assigned to Zone 1.

Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
After putting Theresa on J on the first day, Reynaldo cannot test F, which means that Reynaldo will ride one of the bikes: G, H or J. Yuki cannot test J so she will test either bike F, G, H. But on the second day, Seamus will ride the same bike that Yuki testdrove on the first day.

Therefore, Seamus will ride bike J on the second day. Yuki will ride either G or H on the first day. And Theresa will work on bike H the day after.

K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
If M is published in the fall, the only pair of cookbooks that could be both published in the fall with M is K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall, as mentioned in the context. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
If M is published in the fall, K and O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 3:
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring according to the conditions given. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O, because if K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
If M is published in the fall, the only cookbook that can be published with it in the same season is either N or K & O. Since K and N must be published in the same season, if K is not published in the fall, then N must also be published in the fall, therefore a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.
Response 5:
If M is published in the fall, then according to the given conditions, N must be published in the spring. And since K and N must be published in the same season, K cannot be published in the fall. So, O must be published in the fall. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall with M are L and O. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, so N cannot be paired with M in the fall. Since M and P cannot be published in the same season, P cannot be paired with M. Thus, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
If M is published in the fall, K, N, and O cannot be published in the fall. This leaves us with L, P, and O as the only cookbooks that can be published in the fall. Thus, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is (L and O).
 
Action: Answer("C")

If M is published in the fall, then K and O must be published in the fall. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is Answer("A"): K and O.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 81 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Based on the placement of the optometrist and the shoe store, we can determine the following layout:
```
_ _ _ _ _ _ _
| | | | | | |
| | | | | | |
P ? ? ? ? R
```
We know that the pharmacy must be at one end, either at space 1 or space 7, and also must be next to the optometrist or veterinarian. Because the pharmacy can't be next to the toy store, it needs to be at space 1. So, we have:
```
P _ _ _ _ _ R
```
Because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two businesses, the other restaurant cannot be in space 2, since it would then be adjacent to the pharmacy. Additionally, hotel toy store cannot be in space 2, because it cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the only possible placement of the other restaurant is at space 7:
```
P _ _ _ _ _ R
          R
```
This means that the toy store cannot be in space 6, since it would then be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the only possible placement for the toy store is space 2:
```
P T _ _ _ _ R
          R
```
This leaves the shoe store and the veterinarian to be placed in spaces 3 and 5, but we don't know which order they go in. So, the answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Since the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the one space on the left of the optometrist must be occupied by the pharmacy or the veterinarian. That space cannot be occupied by the veterinarian since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Thus, the pharmacy must be in the space to the left of the optometrist. 

Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it follows that the pharmacy must occupy space 1 and the veterinarian must occupy space 2 or the veterinarian must occupy space 7 and the optometrist must occupy space 6.

If the veterinarian occupies space 2, possibilities for the arrangement of the seven locations become
```
1, P, 2, V, S, O, R
1, P, V, 2, S, O, R
```
If the veterinarian occupies space 7, possibilities for the arrangement of the seven locations become
```
P, 7, V, 6, S, O, R
P, 7, 6, V, S, O, R
```
Thus the two possible arrangements are P, V, S, O, R or P, S, O, V, R. In either case the spaces immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are 2 and 3 (if the order is P, V, S, O, R) or spaces 4 and 5 if the order is P, S, O, V, R. Thus, the correct answer is

Answer: A
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be Answer("BE"). The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian and must be at one end of the row, so it rules out options A, C, and E. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, which rules out option D. Therefore, the answer is either B or E. If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the veterinarian cannot be adjacent to the toy store, so the only logical choice is that the business adjacent to the optometrist and the shoe store is the pharmacy, and the business adjacent to the veterinarian is the toy store. Therefore, the answer is B.

Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.

Response 4:
In any two solid rugs, exactly one color must be common. The only common color among any two solid rugs is white. Hence, both solid rugs must include white. However, white cannot be one of the two colors in a rug that contains olive, so olive must be used in one of the multicolored rugs. For peach to be used, it must be used with olive in one multicolored rug. We see that peach and yellow cannot be used together in the remaining multicolored rug, so one multicolored rug must consist of olive, peach, and white. Since there cannot be another solid rug that uses white, the remaining solid rug must use black, forest, and yellow. Hence, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be Forest and Peach, which is option (A).

To have two solid rugs, two colors must be used in each rug. 'White' must not be one of these two colors because if it was, then only one color would be left for the third rug, which would need to be multicolored. Based on the given restrictions, we see that 'olive' and 'peach' have to go together and that 'peach' cannot be included in the same rug with either 'turquoise' or 'yellow'. Therefore, the possibilities for the two solid rugs are:
1. Forest and Olive
2. Turquoise and Yellow

To determine if Verma could be the project leader, we need to find the selection that meets all the constraints. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Since Verma can't be a member if Wells is selected then, Wells is not selected; only one more person can be eliminated, so neither Taylor nor Ruiz can be. So the 3 people selected are Quinn, Smith, and Xue. Since Verma is not a member, the only way Verma can be the project leader is if Quinn is a project member. Thus, Verma could be the project leader only if Quinn is selected as a project member.

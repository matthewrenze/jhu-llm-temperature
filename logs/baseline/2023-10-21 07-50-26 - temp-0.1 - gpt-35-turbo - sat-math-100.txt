### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit is the difference between the volume of the can and the volume of the syrup: $592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the volume of the empty space in the can. To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the empty space from the total volume of the cylinder. The empty space is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the fruit, which we can call $x$: $592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - x = 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Solving for $x$, we get $x = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the volume of the empty space in the can. To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the empty space from the total volume of the cylinder. The empty space is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the fruit. Therefore, we have:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{empty space}} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the given information. 

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. 

Therefore, the volume of the can is $V = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus any empty space in the can is $591.5 - 110 = 481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since the fruit is packed tightly in the can, we can assume that there is no empty space between the fruit. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is equal to the remaining volume of the can, which is $481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get:

$V = (75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2})(10 \mathrm{~cm}) = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

This is the total volume of the can, including both the syrup and the fruit. To find the volume of the fruit, we need to subtract the volume of the syrup. We are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit is:

$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus the syrup is $591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 701 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

To find the volume of the fruit alone, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $701 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 592.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus the syrup is equal to the volume of the cylinder, which is $592.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $592.5 - 110 = 482.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Answer("C") $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (Note: None of the answer choices are exactly equal to our answer, but C is the closest.)
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the volume of the empty space between the fruit. Let's assume that the fruit is tightly packed and there is no empty space between the fruit. In this case, the volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of the cylinder minus the volume of the syrup. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $V_{\text{fruit}} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get:

$V = Bh = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

This is the total volume of the can, including both the fruit and the syrup. To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume. We are given that the syrup fills the can to the top, so the volume of the syrup is equal to the volume of the cylinder. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is:

$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

So the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is approximately $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus the syrup is $592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 702 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is approximately $702 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we can use the following steps:
- 2 decagrams = 20 grams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)
- 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams (since 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram)

Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

To find the number of 1-milligram doses, we can divide 20,000 by 1:
- 20,000 ÷ 1 = 20,000

So there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we can use the following steps:
- 2 decagrams = 20 grams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)
- 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams (since 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram)

Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

To find the number of 1-milligram doses, we can divide 20,000 by 1:
- 20,000 ÷ 1 = 20,000

So there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \times 10 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20,000 \div 1,000 = 20$ grams in 2 decagrams. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20 \times 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in 20 grams. 

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

To solve this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \times 10 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20,000 \div 1,000 = 20$ grams in 2 decagrams. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20 \times 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in 20 grams. 

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

We can use the given information to convert from decagrams to grams to milligrams: $$\begin{aligned} 1 \text{ decagram } &= 10 \text{ grams } \\ &= 10 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 10,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$ So a 2-decagram container contains $2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. Since we want to know how many 1-milligram doses are in the container, we divide: $$\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram/dose}} = 20,000 \text{ doses}$$ Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$
- The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so:

$5\% = 2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

Simplifying the equation above, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.1 \times 5,880 = 588$

$x = 5,880 + 588 = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. However, this answer is not one of the choices. We need to round it to the nearest whole number, which is 6,440.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

number of subscriptions sold in 2014 = x + 2(percent increase from 2013 to 2014)x

We know that the number of subscriptions sold in 2012 is 5,600 and the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880, so the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is:

percent increase from 2012 to 2013 = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

Let's call the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 y. Then we know that:

2y = percent increase from 2012 to 2013

2y = 5

y = 2.5

So the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is approximately 2.5%. Therefore:

number of subscriptions sold in 2014 = 5,880 + 2(2.5\%)5,880

number of subscriptions sold in 2014 $\approx$ 6,440

Therefore, the answer is C: 6,440.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%=5\%$. Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2y$. We have the equation $$(1+\frac{y}{100})\times 5880=(1+\frac{2y}{100})\times (1+\frac{5}{100})\times 5600.$$ Solving for y, we get $y=8$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5880\times (1+\frac{8}{100})=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 6,440}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. So:

$2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = \frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600}$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$x \approx 6,440$

Therefore, the manager expected about 6,440 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. The closest answer choice is (C) 6,440.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. So:

$2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = \frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600}$

Solving for x, we get:

$x = 6,440$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,440 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%=5\%$. Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2y$. We have the equation $$(1+\frac{y}{100})\times 5880=(1+\frac{2y}{100})\times (1+\frac{5}{100})\times 5600.$$ Solving for y, we get $y=8$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $(1+\frac{8}{100})\times 5880=6440$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. So we can write:

$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 5\% = 2.5\%$

Solving for x, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.025 \times 5,880 = 147$

$x = 5,880 + 147 = 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is closest to choice C (6,440).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$
- The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so:

$5\% = 2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

Simplifying the equation above, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.1 \times 5,880 = 588$

$x = 5,880 + 588 = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. However, this answer is not one of the choices. We need to round it to the nearest whole number, which is 6,440.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("D") 

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%=5\%$. Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2y$. We have the equation $$(1+\frac{y}{100})\times 5880=(1+\frac{2y}{100})\times (1+\frac{5}{100})\times 5600.$$ Solving for y, we get $y=8$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5880\times (1+\frac{8}{100})=\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 6,468}$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$
- The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so:

$5\% = 2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.1 \times 5,880 = 588$

$x = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is closest to choice C (6,440).

Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the beginning of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x\geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x\geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours with a rate of $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $\$ 80$ from those hours. For the remaining hours, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour. Therefore, he earns $10x$ dollars from the remaining hours. In total, he earns $80+10x$ dollars. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x\geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x\geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.

Response 0:
We can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. We can also see that the $y$-intercept is 1. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To find the equation of a line, we need to find its slope and y-intercept. We can use the two points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ to find the slope: $$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$$ Now we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line: $$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$ where $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope. We can use the point $(1,5)$: $$y-5=4(x-1)$$ Simplifying: $$y=4x+1$$ So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x)=4x+1}$.

Response 7:
We can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. Therefore, the equation of the line is of the form $f(x)=4x+b$. To find $b$, we can plug in one of the points, say $(1,5)$, and solve for $b$. We get $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.

Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is $28+57+11+68=164$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11+68=79. 

So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is $28+57+11+68=164$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 68. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is:

$$\frac{68}{164}=\frac{17}{41}$$

Answer: $\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}$
Response 2:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream.

$39+125=164$

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is given in the table as 11+68=79. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$\frac{79}{164}$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$
Response 3:

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given equation and substitute $h$ with the number of hours Mr. Roland's job took. Let's call this number of hours $x$. Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C = 75x + 125$.

We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. Let's call the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job $y$. Therefore, we have $y = x + 2$.

Now, we can find the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job using the given equation and substituting $h$ with $y$. Therefore, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C = 75y + 125$.

To find how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we need to find the difference between the two amounts. Let's subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$(75y + 125) - (75x + 125)$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$75y - 75x$$

Substituting $y = x + 2$, we get:

$$75(x + 2) - 75x$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then he worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. 

For Mr. Roland: $C = 75h + 125$
For Ms. Sanchez: $C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 275$

The difference in the amount charged is:

$$(75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, where $h$ is the number of hours worked. Let's assume that the electrician worked $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$. 

We also know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. Let's assume that the electrician worked $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Therefore, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125$. 

To find out how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:

\begin{align*}
75(x+2)+125-(75x+125)&=75x+150+125-75x-125\\
&=\boxed{\$150}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$150$.
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can do this by plugging in $h$ for the number of hours Mr. Roland's job took: 

$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75(2+ h-2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125 + 150 - 150$$
$$C = 75h + 275 - 150$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

So we see that the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $75h + 125$. 

Now let's find the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so we can plug in $h+2$ for the number of hours her job took: 

$$C = 75(h+2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 150 + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 275$$

So we see that the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $75h + 275$. 

To find how much more Ms. Sanchez was charged than Mr. Roland, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$$(75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, where $h$ is the number of hours worked. Let's say the electrician worked $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$. 

We also know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. Let's say the electrician worked $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Then, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125$. 

To find how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:

\begin{align*}
75(x+2)+125 - (75x+125) &= 75x+150+125-75x-125 \\
&= \boxed{\$ 150}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 150$.
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can do this by plugging in $h$ into the equation $C=75h+125$. Since we don't know the value of $h$ for Mr. Roland's job, we can call it $x$. So, for Mr. Roland's job, $C=75x+125$.

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer. So, the amount of time for Ms. Sanchez's job is $x+2$. Therefore, the amount charged by the electrician for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125$.

To find the difference in the amount charged, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:

\begin{align*}
75(x+2)+125 - (75x+125) &= 75x+150+125-75x-125 \\
&= 75x-75x+275 \\
&= 275
\end{align*}

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$275$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given equation and substitute $h$ with the number of hours he hired the electrician for. Let's call this number of hours $x$. Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C = 75x + 125$.

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer. Let's call the number of hours he worked for Ms. Sanchez $x+2$. Therefore, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C = 75(x+2) + 125$.

To find the difference in the amount charged, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$(75(x+2) + 125) - (75x + 125) = 75x + 150 - 75x = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the cost of Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, and we can let $h$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer, so the number of hours worked was $h+2$. 

To find the difference in cost between the two jobs, we can subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$(75(h+2)+125)-(75h+125)$$
Simplifying this expression, we get:
$$150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. Let's assume he worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Then, he worked for $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Using the given equation, we can calculate the charges for each job as follows:
- For Mr. Roland: $C = 75x + 125$
- For Ms. Sanchez: $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$
The difference in charges between the two jobs is:
$$(75x + 225) - (75x + 125) = 100$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, and we can let $h$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer, so the number of hours worked is $h+2$. Therefore, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. 

To find the difference in cost between the two jobs, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
We can set up the following system of equations to represent the given information:
\begin{align*}
4p+9f+4c&=180 \\
f&=\text{?}
\end{align*}
We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can start by isolating $f$ in the first equation:
\begin{align*}
4p+9f+4c&=180 \\
9f&=180-4p-4c \\
f&=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 1:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 2:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 4:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 5:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 6:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 7:
We can set up a system of equations to solve for $p$, $f$, and $c$. We know that the total number of grams of macronutrients is $p+f+c$, and the total number of food calories is $4p+9f+4c$. We can set up the following system of equations:

\begin{align*}
p+f+c &= \text{total grams of macronutrients} \\
4p+9f+4c &= \text{total food calories} \\
4p &= 180 \\
p &= 45
\end{align*}

Substituting $p=45$ into the second equation, we get $9f+4c=60$. Solving for $f$ in terms of $c$, we get $f=\frac{60-4c}{9}$. Substituting $f=\frac{60-4c}{9}$ into the first equation, we get $45+\frac{56}{9}c=\text{total grams of macronutrients}$. Solving for $c$, we get $c=\frac{9}{56}(\text{total grams of macronutrients}-405)$. Substituting $c=\frac{9}{56}(\text{total grams of macronutrients}-405)$ into $f=\frac{60-4c}{9}$, we get:

\begin{align*}
f &= \frac{60-4\left(\frac{9}{56}(\text{total grams of macronutrients}-405)\right)}{9} \\
&= \frac{60}{9}+\frac{4}{9}\left(\frac{9}{56}(405-\text{total grams of macronutrients})\right) \\
&= 20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 8:
We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given in the problem:

$p + f + c = w$ (where $w$ is the weight of the granola bar in grams)
$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$ (since the 180 food calories come from the given amounts of protein, fat, and carbohydrate)

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can start by solving the first equation for $f$:

$f = w - p - c$

Substituting this into the second equation, we get:

$4p + 9(w - p - c) + 4c = 180$

Simplifying and solving for $w$, we get:

$w = \frac{180 - 5p - 4c}{9}$

Substituting this back into the equation for $f$, we get:

$f = \frac{180 - 5p - 4c}{9} - p - c = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p + c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
We can set up two equations using the information given in the table and the problem statement. Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have:

$180 = pE_p + fE_f + cE_c$
$E_f = 9$ (since all the energy in the granola bar comes from protein, fat, and carbohydrate)

Substituting the second equation into the first and simplifying, we get:

$180 = pE_p + 9f + cE_c$
$9f = 180 - pE_p - cE_c$
$f = 20 - \frac{1}{9}(pE_p + cE_c)$

Using the values from the table, we have $E_p = 4$ and $E_c = 4$, so we can substitute those in and simplify further:

$f = 20 - \frac{1}{9}(4p + 4c)$
$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p + c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by substituting $a=1,000$ into the formula and solving for $t$:
\begin{aligned} 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ 1.08 t &=1,052-1,000 \\ 1.08 t &=52 \\ t &=\frac{52}{1.08} \approx 48.15 \end{aligned}
So the air temperature that makes the speed of a sound wave closest to 1,000 feet per second is about $48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

So the air temperature that makes the speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second is about $48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Among the given choices, the closest one is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each answer choice into the formula and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. However, this can be time-consuming. Alternatively, we can use estimation. 

We know that when $t=0$, $a=1,052$. As $t$ increases, $a$ increases as well. We want to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. Therefore, we need to find the value of $t$ that decreases $a$ by approximately 52. 

Looking at the answer choices, we can see that each choice decreases $t$ by 1 or 2 degrees Fahrenheit. Therefore, we can estimate that the correct answer is likely to be either $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ or $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, as these are the values that are closest to decreasing $t$ by 2 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

\begin{aligned} 1,000 &=1,052+1.08 t \\ 1.08 t &=1,052-1,000 \\ 1.08 t &=52 \\ t &=\frac{52}{1.08} \approx 48.15 \end{aligned}
So the air temperature that makes the speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second is about $48.15^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Among the given choices, the closest one is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\,-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each answer choice into the formula and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. However, we can also use estimation to eliminate some answer choices and narrow down our search. 

At $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-46) \approx 1,000.32$. 

At $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-48) \approx 999.36$. 

At $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-49) \approx 998.88$. 

At $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-50) \approx 998.4$. 

Therefore, the answer is $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but rather the value $-2$.

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ can be found by using the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and the linear term, respectively. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Townsend Realty Group Investments} \\\hlineProperty address & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Purchase price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Monthly rental } \\ \text { price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineClearwater Lane & 128,000 & 950 \\\hlineDriftwood Drive & 176,000 & 1,310 \\\hlineEdgemont Street & 70,000 & 515 \\\hlineGlenview Street & 140,000 & 1,040 \\\hlineHamilton Circle & 450,000 & 3,365 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above. The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table to calculate the slope. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get:

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every $1000$ dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$ dollars. 

The $y$-intercept of the linear function is the rental price when the purchase price is $0$. Since this doesn't make sense in the context of the problem, we can eliminate choices $B$ and $C$ which have non-zero $y$-intercepts. 

Using the slope we calculated, we can write the equation of the linear function in slope-intercept form:

$r(p) = 7.5p + b$

To find $b$, we can use one of the points from the table. For example, using the point $(128, 950)$, we get:

$950 = 7.5(128) + b \Rightarrow b = -10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and purchase price is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

which corresponds to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 1:
The slope of the linear function represents the increase in monthly rental price per thousand dollars increase in purchase price. To find the slope, we can choose two points from the table and use the slope formula: $m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=8$. This means that for every thousand dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $8\text{ dollars}$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can choose any point from the table and substitute the values into the equation $r(p)=mp+b$. For example, using the point $(70, 515)$ and the slope $m=8$, we get $515=8(70)+b$, which gives $b=-405$. 

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$$r(p)=8p-405$$

which is equivalent to answer choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\  r(p)=2.5 p-870}$.
Response 2:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table to calculate the slope. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get:

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every $1000$ dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$ dollars. 

We can also check that the $y$-intercept is close to the rental price of the property with the lowest purchase price. Using the point $(70, 515)$, we get:

$515 = 7.5(70) + b \Rightarrow b = -10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 3:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table to calculate the slope. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get:

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every increase of 1 in $p$, $r$ increases by 7.5. To find the $y$-intercept, we can substitute one of the points into the equation and solve for the intercept. Using the point $(128, 950)$:

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

Therefore, the linear function is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table to calculate the slope. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get:

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every $1000$ dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$ dollars. 

We can also check that the $y$-intercept is close to the rental price for the lowest-priced property. 

The only function that satisfies these conditions is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices between any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties, we get:

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every increase of $1$ in the purchase price (in thousands of dollars), the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$ dollars. 

The y-intercept of the function represents the monthly rental price when the purchase price is $0$. Since this does not make sense in the context of the problem, we can eliminate choices A and C, which have non-zero y-intercepts.

Using the slope calculated above and the rental price and purchase price of any property, we can find the y-intercept of the function. For example, using the first property, we get:

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 6:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table, say $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$, to calculate the slope. The change in rental price is $3365-950=2415$, and the change in purchase price is $450-128=322$. Therefore, the slope is $2415/322=7.5$. The $y$-intercept is the rental price when the purchase price is 0, which is not possible in this context. Therefore, we can use the point-slope form of a linear function to write the equation as $r-950=7.5(p-128)$, which simplifies to $r(p)=7.5p-10$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices between any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties, we get:

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

Therefore, the correct function is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - b$

To find the y-intercept $b$, we can use any of the given properties. Using the third property, we get:

$515 = 7.5(70) + b$

$b = 515 - 525 = -10$

Thus, the function is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 8:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose two points from the table, for example, $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, to find the slope: 

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48} = 7.5$

The $y$-intercept of the linear function is the rental price when the purchase price is 0. Since it doesn't make sense for the purchase price to be 0, the $y$-intercept is not needed to find the function. 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 7.5p + b$

where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. The slope can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices between any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties, we get:

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = 6$

This means that for every $1000 increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $6.0. Therefore, the correct function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 6p - 170$

To solve this problem, we can use the formula: distance = rate x time. 

Nate's rate is 25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.8248 meters per second. 

To find the distance he will walk in 4 minutes (240 seconds), we can multiply his rate by the time: 

distance = 1.8248 meters/second x 240 seconds = 437.952 meters 

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the closest answer choice is:

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as event A, and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as event B. We want to find the conditional probability of A given B. 

We can use the formula for conditional probability: 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

We can find P(B) by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always": 

P(B) = 24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9% = 68.7%

To find P(A and B), we need to look at the table and see what percentage of tablet users answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." We can see that this is the "Always" percentage, which is 30.9%. 

Therefore, 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% 

Simplifying, 

P(A|B) = 0.449 or approximately 0.45 

So the answer is (C) 0.45.

Therefore, 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% 

P(A|B) is closest to 0.45, which is choice (C). 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

We can find P(B) by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always": 

P(B) = 24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9% = 68.7%

To find P(A and B), we need to look at the table and see what percentage of tablet users answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." We can see that this is the "Always" percentage, which is 30.9%. 

So, 

P(A and B) = 30.9%

Now we can plug in these values into the formula for conditional probability: 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% 

Simplifying this fraction, we get: 

P(A|B) = 0.449 or approximately 0.45 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's call the event of a user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$. 

$B$ is the complement of the event "Never", so $B$ is the event of a user answering "Rarely", "Often", or "Always". We can find $P(B)$ by adding the percentages of these three categories: 

$P(B) = 24.3\% + 13.5\% + 30.9\% = 68.7\%$

Now we can use Bayes' theorem to find $P(A|B)$: 

$P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$

$P(B|A)$ is the probability that a user did not answer "Never" given that they answered "Always". This is 1, since if a user answered "Always", then they definitely did not answer "Never". 

$P(A)$ is the probability that a user answered "Always", which is 30.9%. 

$P(B)$ is 68.7%, which we calculated earlier. 

Plugging in these values, we get: 

$P(A|B) = \dfrac{1 \cdot 30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx 0.45$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.
Response 4:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as event A, and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as event B. We want to find P(A|B), the probability of event A given event B. 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

P(B) = P(Rarely) + P(Often) + P(Always) = 0.243 + 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.687

P(A and B) = P(A) - P(A and Never) = 0.309 - 0.313 = 0.996

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 0.996 / 0.687 ≈ 1.45

Since probabilities must be between 0 and 1, the closest choice to 1.45 is 1, which is not one of the available choices. Therefore, the most likely answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as A and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as B. We want to find P(A|B). 

Using Bayes' Theorem, we have:

P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that P(A) = 0.309 and P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687. 

To find P(B|A), we need to look at the row for "Always" and see what percent of those who answered "Always" did not answer "Never". From the table, we see that 30.9% of all respondents answered "Always" and 31.3% of all respondents answered "Never". Therefore, the percent of those who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is:

(30.9% - 31.3%) / 30.9% = 0.013 / 0.309 = 0.042

Plugging everything into Bayes' Theorem, we get:

P(A|B) = 0.042 * 0.309 / 0.687 = 0.019

Therefore, the closest answer choice is A: 0.31.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's first calculate the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never". This is equal to $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 

Now, we want to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never". We can calculate this using conditional probability:

$P(\text{Always}|\text{Not Never}) = \dfrac{P(\text{Always and Not Never})}{P(\text{Not Never})}$

We can find $P(\text{Always and Not Never})$ by multiplying the percentage of users who answered "Always" by the percentage of users who did not answer "Never":

$P(\text{Always and Not Never}) = 30.9 \% \cdot 68.7 \% = 21.2 \%$

Plugging this and $P(\text{Not Never}) = 68.7 \%$ into the conditional probability formula, we get:

$P(\text{Always}|\text{Not Never}) = \dfrac{21.2 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.308$

So the closest answer choice is A: 0.31. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as event A, and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as event B. We want to find the conditional probability of A given B. 

We can use the formula for conditional probability: 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

We can find P(B) by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always": 

P(B) = 24.3% + 13.5% + 30.9% = 68.7%

To find P(A and B), we need to look at the table and see what percentage of tablet users answered "Always" and did not answer "Never." We can see that this is the "Always" percentage, which is 30.9%. 

So, 

P(A and B) = 30.9%

Now we can plug in these values into the formula for conditional probability: 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% 

Simplifying this fraction, we get: 

P(A|B) = 0.449 or approximately 0.45 

Therefore, the answer is (C) 0.45.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals. We know that the total number of calories is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$30x = 60$

$x = 2/3$

So Jennifer uses $\frac{2}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal and $\frac{1}{3}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

To check our answer, we can calculate the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture:

$240\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 210\left(\frac{1}{3}\right) = 160 + 70 = 230$

This is not exactly 270, but it is close. We can see that we need a little more Super Grain cereal to get to 270 calories. 

To find out how much Super Grain cereal we need, we can use proportions. We know that $\frac{2}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal provide 160 calories, so we can set up the following proportion:

$\frac{2/3}{160} = \frac{x}{270}$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{270}{160} = \frac{9}{8}$

So Jennifer needs $\frac{9}{8}-\frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{24}$ cups more of Super Grain cereal.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B") $\frac{1}{4}$ cup.
Response 1:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. 

The number of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$. 

The number of calories from $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal is $240x$. 

So, we have the equation $280+240x=270$. 

Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{1}{4}$. 

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. We can set up the equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
240x + 210(1-x) &= 270 \\
240x + 210 - 210x &= 270 \\
30x &= 60 \\
x &= 2
\end{align*}
Therefore, Jennifer uses 2 cups of Super Grain cereal and $(1-2)=-1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal, which doesn't make sense. So, we can conclude that Jennifer cannot make a mixture with the given conditions. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $280 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $270 - 280 \cdot \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We can set up an equation to solve for $x$:

\begin{align*}
240x + 50\cdot\frac{3}{4}\cdot280 &= 270\cdot\frac{3}{4} \\
240x + 31500 &= 60750 \\
240x &= 29250 \\
x &= \frac{29250}{240} \\
x &= 121.875
\end{align*}

Since we cannot have a fraction of a cup, we round $x$ to the nearest quarter cup, which is $\frac{1}{4}$ cup.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 4:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is the sum of the calories from the Super Grain cereal and the Crunchy Grain cereal. We know that the total number of calories is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

So Jennifer uses 2/3 cup of Super Grain cereal and 1/3 cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Therefore, the answer is $\frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{12}$ cup of Super Grain cereal.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. We know that Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)$. 

We can set up an equation to solve for $x$: 

\begin{align*}
240x + 50\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) &= 270-280\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right) \\
240x + 37.5 - 50x &= 270 - 210 + 280x \\
190x &= 97.5 \\
x &= \frac{97.5}{190} \approx 0.513
\end{align*}

Therefore, Jennifer mixes approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{97.5}{400}=\frac{103}{400}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals. We know that the total number of calories is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$30x = 60$

Dividing both sides by 30, we get:

$x = 2/4 = 1/2$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Super Grain cereal.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. 

The number of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is: 

$$\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\cdot x=280x$$

The number of calories from one cup of Super Grain cereal is:

$$240\cdot x=240x$$

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$$280x+240x=270$$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$$520x=270$$

$$x=\frac{27}{52}$$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{27}{52}$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{27}{52}=\frac{9}{52}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.

To find the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, we need to divide the amount of Super Grain cereal by the total amount of cereal:

$$\frac{\frac{27}{52}}{\frac{3}{4}}=\frac{9}{13}$$

So, Jennifer mixes $\frac{9}{13}$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{4}{13}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 8:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is the sum of the calories from the Super Grain cereal and the Crunchy Grain cereal. We know that the total number of calories is 270, so we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$240x + 210 - 210x = 270$

$30x = 60$

$x = 2$

So Jennifer uses 2/3 cup of Super Grain cereal and 1/3 cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Therefore, the answer is $\frac{2}{3} - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{12}$ cup of Super Grain cereal.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is the sum of the calories from one cup of Super Grain cereal and the calories from one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Since one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, then one cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$ calories. 

Since the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, then the number of calories from one cup of Super Grain cereal is $270-280=-10$ calories. 

Since one cup of Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories, then the number of cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is $\frac{-10}{240}=-\frac{1}{24}$ cup. 

Since we cannot have a negative amount of cereal, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") $\frac{1}{8}$ cup.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let the volume of the fruit be $V$. Then the total volume of the can is $V + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. The volume of a cylinder is given by $\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^2$, we have $\pi r^2 = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^2$, so $r = 5/\sqrt{\pi} \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (5/\sqrt{\pi})^2 (10) = 250 \mathrm{~cm}^3$, so $V + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^3 = 250 \mathrm{~cm}^3$ and $V = 140 \mathrm{~cm}^3$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 (10) \approx 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the volume of the empty space between the fruit. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

So the closest answer choice is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given information. 

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is: 

$V = \pi r^2 h$

where $r$ is the radius of the base of the cylinder and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. 

We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, which means that the radius is:

$r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$

Using this radius and the given height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the volume of the cylinder:

$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \approx 586.51 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We also know that the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

To find the volume of the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the volume of the cylinder:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - V_{\text{syrup}} \approx 476.51 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let's first find the volume of the cylinder using the given information. 

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. 

We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. 

Using this radius and the given height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the volume of the cylinder: 

$V_{cylinder} = \pi \cdot (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 \cdot 10 \mathrm{~cm} \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

We are also given that it takes $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the fruit plus any empty space in the can must be $591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the volume of the fruit alone is $481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given information. 

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since we are given the area of the base, we can find the radius using the formula for the area of a circle: $A = \pi r^2$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. 

Now we can find the volume of the cylinder: $V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 (10) \approx 1088 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit must be $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cylinder}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 977 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Finally, we need to select the answer choice that is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given information. 

The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. 

We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius can be found by taking the square root of $\frac{75}{\pi}$:

$r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$

Using the given height of $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can find the volume of the cylinder:

$V_{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h \approx 591.47 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit must be:

$V_{fruit} = V_{cylinder} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481.47 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is:

Action: Answer("C") $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 6:
Let's first find the volume of the cylinder using the given information. 

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We are not given the radius directly, but we can find it using the formula for the area of a circle: $A = \pi r^2$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33$ cm.

Now we can find the volume of the cylinder: $V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \approx 541.27$ cm$^3$.

Finally, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume to get an estimate for the volume of the fruit: $V_{\text{fruit}} \approx 110 - 541.27 \approx -431.27$ cm$^3$. This doesn't make sense as a volume, so we can conclude that none of the answer choices are correct.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is approximately $\pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This means that the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is approximately $592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Answer("C") $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (the closest choice to 482)
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we get $V = (75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2})(10 \mathrm{~cm}) = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

This is the total volume of the can, including both the fruit and the syrup. To find the volume of the fruit, we need to subtract the volume of the syrup. We are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit is $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the given information. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, its radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $\pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is approximately $591 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 481 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we can use the following steps:
- 2 decagrams = 20 grams (since 1 decagram = 10 grams)
- 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams (since 1,000 milligrams = 1 gram)

Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

1 decagram = 10 grams
1 gram = 1000 milligrams

So, 1 decagram = 10 x 1000 = 10,000 milligrams

Therefore, 2 decagrams = 2 x 10,000 = 20,000 milligrams

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are 20,000/1,000 = 20 grams in 2 decagrams.

Finally, since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are 20 x 1,000 = 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

$2 \text{ decagrams} = 2 \times 10 \text{ grams} = 20 \text{ grams}$

$20 \text{ grams} = 20 \times 1000 \text{ milligrams} = 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$

So, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

Since we want to know how many 1-milligram doses are in one 2-decagram container, we divide 20,000 by 1:

$20,000 \div 1 = 20,000$

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
We can use the given information to convert from decagrams to grams to milligrams: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text{ decagram } &=10 \text{ grams } \\1 \text{ gram } &=1,000 \text{ milligrams }\end{aligned}$$So, 1 decagram is equal to $10 \times 1,000 = 10,000$ milligrams. 

Therefore, a 2-decagram container is equal to $2 \times 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. 

Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $\frac{20,000}{1} = 20,000$ doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we need to use the given conversion factors: $$\begin{aligned}2\text{ decagrams }&=2\times10\text{ grams }\\&=20\text{ grams }\\&=20\times1000\text{ milligrams }\\&=20,000\text{ milligrams }\end{aligned}$$Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. To find the number of 1-milligram doses, we divide 20,000 by 1: $$\frac{20,000\text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ milligram}}=20,000$$So there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams} &= 2 \cdot 10 \text{ grams} \\ &= 20 \cdot 1000 \text{ milligrams} \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams} \end{aligned}$$

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20,000 \div 1,000 = 20$ grams in 2 decagrams. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $20 \cdot 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams in 20 grams. 

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
We know that 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams. Therefore, 2 decagrams is equal to 20 grams. We also know that 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram. Therefore, 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. 

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we can use the given conversion factors: $$\begin{aligned}2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 100 \text{ milligrams } \\&= 2,000 \text{ milligrams}\end{aligned}$$Since there are 2,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, there are also 2,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can use the following conversions to solve the problem:
$$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$

To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we can use the following steps:

$$\begin{aligned}2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \cdot 10 \text{ grams } \\&= 20 \text{ grams } \\&= 20 \cdot 1,000 \text{ milligrams } \\&= 20,000 \text{ milligrams }\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

To find the number of 1-milligram doses, we can divide 20,000 by 1:

$$\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram}} = 20,000$$

So there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
We can use the given conversion factors to convert from decagrams to grams to milligrams. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams} &= 20 \text{ grams} \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams} \end{aligned}$$

So there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

To find how many 1-milligram doses there are, we can divide by 1 milligram: 

$$\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram}} = 20,000$$

So there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
To find the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states, we need to order the percents from least to greatest: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
First, we need to order the percentages from least to greatest: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value. Since we have an odd number of values, the median is the fourth value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is: 

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
First, we need to find the median of these 7 states. Arranging the given percentages in order, we get: $$19.5 \% , 21.9 \% , 25.9 \% , 27.9 \% , 30.1 \% , 35.5 \% , 36.4 \%$$ Since there are an odd number of states, the median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states is: $$\left| 27.9 \% - 26.95 \% \right| = 0.95 \%$$ Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 3:
First, we need to order the data from least to greatest: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median of this data is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95 \% - 27.9 \% = -0.95 \%$. 

Since the question asks for the absolute value of the difference, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B") $0.95 \%$
Response 4:
First, we need to find the median of the given 7 states. Arranging the given percentages in order, we get: $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, and $36.4 \%$. The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 5:
First, we need to arrange the given data in order: 
$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$.

The median is the middle value in the data set when the values are arranged in order. In this case, the median is $27.9 \%$.

The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is: 
$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x. Since the number of subscriptions sold increased from 5,880 to 6,440, the percent increase is $\frac{6,440-5,880}{5,880}=0.095$. Therefore, we have the equation $2x=\frac{6,440}{5,880}-1=0.095$. Solving for x, we get $x=0.0475$. So the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5,880\times(1+0.0475)\approx \boxed{\textbf{(A) }6,020}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D") 

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5% 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have: 

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = \frac{6200-5880}{5880} = \frac{x}{100}$ 

Solving for x, we get: 

$x = 10.2$ 

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be: 

$5880 + 0.102(5880) \approx 6468$ 

So the answer is (D) 6,468.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x-5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. So we can write:

$\frac{x-5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 5\% = 2.5\%$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$x - 5,880 = 0.025 \times 5,880 = 147$

$x = 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. The closest answer choice is (C) 6,440, but it is not the correct answer.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase $=\frac{\text{new value}-\text{old value}}{\text{old value}}\times 100\%$

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is:
$$\frac{x-5{,}880}{5{,}880}\times 100\%=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{5{,}880-5{,}600}{5{,}600}\times 100\%\right)$$
Simplifying the right-hand side gives:
$$\frac{x-5{,}880}{5{,}880}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{280}{5{,}600}\right)$$
$$\frac{x-5{,}880}{5{,}880}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)$$
$$x-5{,}880=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)(5{,}880)$$
$$x=5{,}880+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{20}\right)(5{,}880)$$
$$x=6{,}440$$
Therefore, the manager expected 6,440 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C") 

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$. Letting y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have that the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $0.1 = 2(0.05)(1+y)$. Solving for y, we get $y = 0.9/1.1 - 0.05 \approx 0.7273$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately $5880(1+y) \approx 6440$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6,440}$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can start by finding the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5% 

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have: 

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = \frac{6000(1+x) - 5880}{5880}$ 

Solving for x: 

$x \approx 0.087$ or 8.7% 

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be: 

$5880(1+0.087) \approx 6440$ 

So the answer is (C) 6,440.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase: 

percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value} - \text{old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

The problem tells us that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. So:

$2 \times \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = \frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600}$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$x \approx 6,440$

Therefore, the manager expected about 6,440 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for percent increase:
percent increase = $\frac{\text{new value - old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then we have:

- From 2012 to 2013: percent increase = $\frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$
- From 2013 to 2014: percent increase = $\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$
- The problem states that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so we have:

$2 \times 5\% = \frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\%$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = 0.1$

$x - 5,880 = 0.1 \times 5,880$

$x = 6,468$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is closest to choice C (6,440).
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C") 

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot 100\% = 5\%$, and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x-5880}{5880}\cdot 100\%$. The manager estimated that $$2\cdot \frac{x-5880}{5880}\cdot 100\% = \frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot 100\%.$$ Solving for $x$, we get $x=6440$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6,440}$.
Response 9:
Let's first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$ or 5%

Let's call the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 "x". Then, according to the problem, we know:

$2(0.05) = 0.1 = x$

To find the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we need to add the percent increase to the number sold in 2013:

$5880 + (0.1)(5880) = 5880 + 588 = 6468$

Therefore, the answer is (D) 6,468.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the beginning of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives us $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 1:
Let's first find out how much Ken earns in the first 10 hours. He earns $\$8$ per hour, so he earns $\$8 \cdot 10 = \$80$ in the first 10 hours. 

Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. He earns $\$10$ per hour, so he earns $\$10h$ for those hours. 

Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(\$80 + \$10h) = \$72 + \$9h$ for the week. 

We want to find the least number of hours $h$ such that $\$9h + \$72 \geq \$270$. 

Simplifying the inequality gives $h \geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then the total amount he earns for the week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72 + 9x \geq 270$, which simplifies to $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then, he works a total of $10+x$ hours. 

The amount he earns for the first 10 hours is $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars. 

For the remaining $x$ hours, he earns $10x$ dollars. 

Therefore, his total earnings for the week is $80+10x$ dollars. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars. 

We want to find the least value of $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$. 

Solving this inequality gives us $x \geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Then, he earns $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this amount, which is $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving this inequality gives $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 5:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week.
The amount of money he earns from the first 10 hours is $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars.
The amount of money he earns from the remaining $x$ hours is $10x$ dollars.
The total amount of money he earns for the week is $80 + 10x$ dollars.
He saves 90% of his earnings, so the amount of money he saves for the week is $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars.
We want to find the least value of $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$.
Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$.
Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week. So, his total earnings for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want this to be at least $270$, so we have the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours in the first part of the week. His total earnings for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Since he saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72+9x\geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then, he will have worked $10+x$ hours in total. 

The amount of money he earns from the first 10 hours is $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars. 

The amount of money he earns from the remaining $x$ hours is $10x$ dollars. 

The total amount of money he earns is $80+10x$ dollars. 

He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$ dollars. 

We want to find the least value of $x$ such that $72+9x \geq 270$. 

Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$. 

Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then the total amount of money he earns for the week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80 + 10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $72 + 9x \ge 270$, or $9x \ge 198$, or $x \ge 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
To find the correct answer, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

The production decreased from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is:

$$m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

The y-intercept is the initial production in 2000, which is 4 million barrels. Therefore, the linear function is:

$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the correct answer, we need to use the slope-intercept form of the linear equation $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is:

$$m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{-2.1}{13}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, which means that $f(0)=4$. Therefore, the y-intercept is:

$$b=f(0)=4$$

Putting it all together, we get the linear function:

$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$

So the correct answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 2:
We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. This gives us a rate of change of $m = \frac{-2.1}{13} = -\frac{21}{130}$. 

We also know that in the year 2000, $t=0$, the production was 4 million barrels, so the $y$-intercept is $b=4$. 

Therefore, the linear function that models the production is $f(t) = -\frac{21}{130}t + 4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the linear function that best models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear function: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average decrease per year is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year.

Since the production is decreasing, the slope of the linear function is negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes.

Now we need to choose between choices C and D. To do that, we can plug in the year 2013 (which is 13 years after 2000) and see which function gives us 1.9 million barrels:

For choice C: $f(13)=-\frac{21}{130}(13)+4\approx 1.9$

For choice D: $f(13)=-\frac{19}{130}(13)+4\approx 1.89$

Therefore, the best linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$, or choice C. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find the linear function that best models the production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of 2.1 million barrels over 13 years. Therefore, the average decrease per year is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx0.1615$ million barrels per year.

The slope of the linear function that models the production is equal to the average decrease per year, which is approximately $-0.1615$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000. Therefore, the y-intercept is 4.

Now we can write the linear function that best models the production:

$f(t)=-0.1615t+4$

where $t$ is the number of years after 2000.

To match this function with one of the choices, we can simplify it as follows:

$f(t)=-\frac{1615}{10000}t+4$

$f(t)=-\frac{23}{143}t+4$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the linear function that models the oil and gas production, we need to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We know that the production dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013, which is a decrease of $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels over a period of 13 years. Therefore, the average rate of decrease is $\frac{2.1}{13}\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. 

The slope of the linear function that models the production is the rate of decrease, which is negative. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B, which have positive slopes. 

We also know that the initial production in 2000 was 4 million barrels, which means that $f(0)=4$. Therefore, the y-intercept of the linear function is 4. 

Now we can use the slope and y-intercept to find the linear function. 

Choice C has a slope of $-\frac{21}{130}$ and a y-intercept of 4. Therefore, the linear function that models the production is $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$.

To find the y-intercept, we can use either of the two points we have: $(0,4)$ or $(13,1.9)$. Using the first point, we get:

$$4=-\frac{21}{130}(0)+b$$
$$b=4$$

Therefore, the linear function that models the production is:

$$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4$$

The slope of the linear function that models the production is the rate of decrease, which is $m=-0.1615$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use the fact that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, which means that $f(0)=4$.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
To find the equation of the linear function $f$, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. The slope is the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$, which is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can use any point on the line, say $(1,5)$. Using the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, we have $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Thus, $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the equation of a line given two points, we can use the slope-intercept form of the equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We can find the slope of the line that passes through the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ by using the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$. 

Now we can use the point-slope form of the equation to find the equation of the line: $y-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying, we get $y=4x+1$. 

We can check that this equation also passes through the point $(5,21)$, so it must be the correct answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To determine the equation of the linear function $f$, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. The slope is given by the difference in $f(x)$ values over the difference in $x$ values. For example, the slope between $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $(13-5)/(3-1)=4$. We can verify that this is true for all pairs of points in the table. 

Next, we need to find the $y$-intercept. We can use any point and the slope to find the $y$-intercept. For example, using the point $(1,5)$ and the slope $4$, we can write the equation of the line in slope-intercept form as $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To find the equation of a linear function, we need to use the slope-intercept form $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table. Let's use the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$: 

slope $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$

Now we can use the slope and one of the points to find the $y$-intercept $b$: 

$5=4(1)+b \Rightarrow b=1$

Therefore, the equation of the linear function $f$ is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can see that the slope of the line is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. We can also see that the $y$-intercept is $(0,f(0))=(0,1)$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
We can see that $f(x)$ increases by $8$ when $x$ increases by $2$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $8/2=4$. We also know that $f(1)=5$, so the $y$-intercept is $5-4(1)=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To find the equation of a linear function, we need to find the slope and the $y$-intercept. We can use the values in the table to find the slope: 

slope $= \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x} = \frac{21-5}{5-1} = \frac{16}{4} = 4$

Now we can use the slope and one of the points to find the $y$-intercept using the point-slope form of the equation of a line:

$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$

Let's use the point $(1,5)$:

$y - 5 = 4(x - 1)$

$y - 5 = 4x - 4$

$y = 4x + 1$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(x)=4x+1$.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is $28+57+11+68=164$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11+68=79. 

So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200}=\frac{164}{200}$. The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{68}{39+68}=\frac{68}{107}$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{164}{200}\cdot\frac{68}{107}=\frac{17\cdot4}{25\cdot107}=\frac{68}{107}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
The probability that a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200} = \frac{164}{200}$. 
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{125}$ since there were 68 people in Group Y who recalled 5 or more dreams out of a total of 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams. 
Therefore, the probability that a person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is: 

$$\frac{\frac{68}{125} \cdot \frac{164}{200}}{\frac{164}{200}} = \frac{68}{125} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{68}{100}}$$
Response 3:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the ratio of the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream to the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. This is given by:

$\frac{68}{125+39} = \frac{68}{164}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 4:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream: 

$39+125=164$

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11+68=79. 

So, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$\frac{79}{164}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 5:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled at least one dream, which is $28+57+11+68=164$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream is  $11+68=79$. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least one dream is $\frac{79}{164}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Out of the 39 people who recalled at least one dream, 68-11=57 people belonged to Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{57}{39} = \frac{19}{13}$$

However, we need to find the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream. This is:

$$\frac{\frac{57}{100}}{\frac{39}{200}} = \frac{57}{39} \cdot \frac{200}{100} = \frac{114}{39} = \frac{38}{13}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled at least one dream: 

$28+57+11+68=164$

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream is:

$11+68=79$

So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$\frac{79}{164}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 8:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the number of people in Group X and Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream, which is $28+57+11+68=164$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is 11+68=79. 

Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given equation, where $h$ is the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job. So, for Mr. Roland's job, we have:
$$C = 75h + 125$$
Now, let's say the electrician worked $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. So, for Ms. Sanchez's job, we have:
$$C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 225$$
The difference in the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:
$$\begin{aligned} 75h + 225 - (75h + 125) &= 100 \\ &= \$100 \end{aligned}$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:
Let's first find the cost of Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then we can substitute $h$ into the equation to get $C=75h+125$. 

Now, let's say the electrician worked $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. We can substitute $h+2$ into the equation to get the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job: $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$.

The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is: 

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$$
Response 2:
Let's start by finding how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland. If the electrician worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then he worked $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Therefore, the cost of Mr. Roland's job is $C=75h+125$ and the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. The difference in cost is: 

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given equation and substitute $h$ with the number of hours Mr. Roland's job took. Let's call this number of hours $x$. So, for Mr. Roland's job, $C = 75x + 125$.

Now, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. Let's call the number of hours for Ms. Sanchez's job $x+2$. So, for Ms. Sanchez's job, $C = 75(x+2) + 125$.

To find the difference in the amount charged, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:
\begin{align*}
C_{\text{Sanchez}} - C_{\text{Roland}} &= [75(x+2) + 125] - [75x + 125]\\
&= 75x + 150 + 125 - 75x - 125\\
&= 150
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged and the amount Mr. Roland was charged. 

Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C = 75h + 125$, where $h$ is the number of hours worked. Let's say the electrician worked $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is:

$$C_R = 75x + 125$$

We also know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. So, if the electrician worked $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job, the amount charged for her job is:

$$C_S = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$$

Now, we can find the difference between the two amounts:

$$C_S - C_R = (75x + 225) - (75x + 125) = 100$$

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (since none of the choices is $\$100$)
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the amount charged by the electrician for Mr. Roland's job. We can substitute $h$ with $x$ (let's assume he worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job) in the equation $C=75h+125$ to get $C=75x+125$. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked for 2 hours longer, so the amount charged can be expressed as $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$. 

The difference in the amount charged is then $75x+225-(75x+125)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 6:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then the amount charged is $C=75h+125$. 

For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked 2 hours longer, which means the amount charged is $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. 

To find the difference in the amount charged, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Let's first find the cost of Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours for Mr. Roland, then he worked $h+2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. We can set up the following system of equations:
$$C_R=75h+125$$
$$C_S=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$
where $C_R$ is the cost of Mr. Roland's job and $C_S$ is the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job. 

To find the difference in cost, we can subtract $C_R$ from $C_S$:
$$C_S-C_R=(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked for $x$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then we can write an equation: $C=75x+125$. 

Now, we know that the electrician worked for 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. So, if the electrician worked for $x+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job, then the amount charged for her job is $C=75(x+2)+125$. 

To find the difference in the amount charged, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:

\begin{align*}
75(x+2)+125 - (75x+125) &= 75x+150+125-75x-125 \\
&= \boxed{\$ 150}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$150$.
Response 9:
Let's first find the cost of Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the cost of Mr. Roland's job is $C=75x+125$. 

We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. Let $x+2$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job. Then, the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75(x+2)+125=75x+225$. 

The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

\begin{align*}
75x+225-(75x+125)&=100 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
We can set up a system of equations using the information given in the problem. We know that the total number of grams of macronutrients is $p+f+c$, and the total number of food calories is $4p+9f+4c$. We can set up the following system of equations:
\begin{align*}
p+f+c&= \text{total grams of macronutrients} \\
4p+9f+4c &= \text{total food calories} \\
180 &= \text{total food calories}
\end{align*}
Substituting the third equation into the second equation, we get $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 1:
We can set up two equations using the information given in the problem. We know that the total number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar is $p+f+c$, and we also know that the total number of food calories in the granola bar is $4p+9f+4c$. We can set up the following system of equations:

$$\begin{aligned} p+f+c &= \text{total grams} \\ 4p+9f+4c &= \text{total food calories} \end{aligned}$$

We are given that the total food calories is 180, so we can substitute that into the second equation:

$$4p+9f+4c = 180$$

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can isolate $f$ on one side of the equation by subtracting $4p$ and $4c$ from both sides and then dividing by 9:

$$\begin{aligned} 9f &= 180-4p-4c \\ f &= \frac{180-4p-4c}{9} \\ f &= 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c) \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 2:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories. We can express this in terms of $p$, $f$, and $c$ using the given information in the table. We have:

$180 = 4p + 9f + 4c$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$

$9f = 20(9 - 4p - 4c/9)$

$9f = 180 - 80p/9 - 80c/9$

$9f = 180 - \frac{80}{9}(p + c)$

$f = 20 - \frac{80}{81}(p + c)$

Simplifying the last expression, we get:

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p + c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$, where $p$, $f$, and $c$ are the grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively, in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 4:
We can set up the following system of equations based on the information given: 

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$ (since all the calories come from protein, fat, and carbohydrate)
$p + f + c = g$ (where $g$ is the total number of grams in the granola bar)

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can solve the second equation for $f$ to get $f = g - p - c$. Substituting this into the first equation, we get:

$4p + 9(g - p - c) + 4c = 180$

Simplifying and solving for $g$, we get:

$g = \frac{180 - 5p - 4c}{9}$

Substituting this back into the equation for $f$, we get:

$f = \frac{180 - 5p - 4c}{9} - p - c = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 5:
We are given that the energy in a granola bar comes entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. We can set up an equation using the information given in the table to represent the total energy in the granola bar:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$4p+4c=180-9f$

$4(p+c)=180-9f$

$p+c=\frac{180-9f}{4}$

$p+c=45-\frac{9}{4}f$

Subtracting $p$ from both sides, we get:

$c=45-\frac{9}{4}f-p$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 6:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$ to represent the total amount of energy in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$. Simplifying this expression, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 7:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$, where $p$, $f$, and $c$ are the grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively, in the granola bar. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}(9-\frac{4}{9}(p+c))$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories. We can set up the equation: 

$180=4p+9f+4c$

Simplifying, we get: 

$180=4(p+c)+5f$

$5f=180-4(p+c)$

$f=36-\frac{4}{5}(p+c)$

$f=36-\frac{4}{5}p-\frac{4}{5}c$

$f=36-\frac{4}{5}p-\frac{4}{5}c$

$f=20+\frac{1}{5}(5-p-c)$

$f=20-\frac{4}{5}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
The 180 food calories come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. From the table, we know that each gram of protein provides 4 food calories, each gram of fat provides 9 food calories, and each gram of carbohydrate provides 4 food calories. Therefore, we can write the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.

Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
To solve the equation, we can first add x to both sides of the equation to get $\sqrt{k+2}=x$. Then, we can square both sides to get $k+2=x^2$. Finally, we can solve for k by subtracting 2 from both sides to get $k=x^2-2$. 

Action: Answer("79") 

If $x=9$, then $k=9^2-2=79$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$ on one side of the equation. 

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
$$k=x^2-2$$

Substituting $x=9$ into the equation above, we get:

$$k=9^2-2=79$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$. We start by adding $x$ to both sides of the equation: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$ $$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$ $$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$ Now we square both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: $$k+2=81$$ $$k=79$$
 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To solve for k, we can isolate k by squaring both sides of the equation. 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ \sqrt{k+2}^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Now we can substitute x with 9 and solve for k.

$$\begin{aligned} k&=x^2-2 \\ &=9^2-2 \\ &=79 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve the equation, we can isolate $k$ by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us: $$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ (\sqrt{k+2})^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned} $$ Substituting $x=9$ into the equation above, we get: $$k=9^2-2=79$$ Therefore, the answer is (D) 79.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve the equation, we can square both sides to get $k+2=x^2=81$. Therefore, $k=81-2=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
To solve for $k$, we need to isolate $k$ on one side of the equation. We start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2&=0^2 \\ k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2&=0 \end{aligned}$$

Now we can substitute $x=9$ and solve for $k$: 

$$\begin{aligned} k+2-2(9)\sqrt{k+2}+9^2&=0 \\ k+2-18\sqrt{k+2}+81&=0 \\ k-79&=18\sqrt{k+2} \\ (k-79)^2&=(18\sqrt{k+2})^2 \\ k^2-158k+6241&=324k+1296 \\ k^2-482k+4945&=0 \\ (k-7)(k-705)&=0 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, $k=7$ or $k=705$. However, since we are given that $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, $k+2=x^2=81$, which means $k=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To solve the equation, we can isolate $k$ by squaring both sides and then adding $81$ to both sides. This gives us: $$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-9&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=9 \\ k+2&=81 \\ k&=79 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate $k$ on one side of the equation. We can start by squaring both sides of the equation to get rid of the square root: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x &= 0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-x)^2 &= 0^2 \\ k+2-2x\sqrt{k+2}+x^2 &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

Now we can plug in $x=9$ and solve for $k$: 

$$\begin{aligned} k+2-2(9)\sqrt{k+2}+9^2 &= 0 \\ k+2-18\sqrt{k+2}+81 &= 0 \\ k-79 &= -2\sqrt{k+2} \\ (k-79)^2 &= (-2\sqrt{k+2})^2 \\ k^2-158k+6241 &= 4k+8 \\ k^2-162k+6233 &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: 

$$k = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$$

where $a=1$, $b=-162$, and $c=6233$. 

$$\begin{aligned} k &= \frac{-(-162)\pm\sqrt{(-162)^2-4(1)(6233)}}{2(1)} \\ &= \frac{162\pm\sqrt{26244-24932}}{2} \\ &= \frac{162\pm\sqrt{1312}}{2} \\ &= \frac{162\pm8\sqrt{41}}{2} \\ &= 81\pm4\sqrt{41} \end{aligned}$$

Since we are looking for a value of $k$, we can discard the negative solution and choose the positive solution: 

$$k = 81+4\sqrt{41}$$

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by plugging in each answer choice for $t$ and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. Then, we can compare these values to 1,000 and see which one is closest.

Action: 

Substituting $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get:

$$a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,052-49.68=1,002.32$$

Substituting $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get:

$$a=1,052+1.08(-48)=1,052-51.84=1,000.16$$

Substituting $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get:

$$a=1,052+1.08(-49)=1,052-52.92=999.08$$

Substituting $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get:

$$a=1,052+1.08(-50)=1,052-54=998$$

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}\hline\multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Townsend Realty Group Investments} \\\hlineProperty address & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Purchase price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Monthly rental } \\ \text { price } \\ \text { (dollars) }\end{array}$ \\\hlineClearwater Lane & 128,000 & 950 \\\hlineDriftwood Drive & 176,000 & 1,310 \\\hlineEdgemont Street & 70,000 & 515 \\\hlineGlenview Street & 140,000 & 1,040 \\\hlineHamilton Circle & 450,000 & 3,365 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The Townsend Realty Group invested in the five different properties listed in the table above. The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can calculate the slope using two of the properties listed in the table. For example, using Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, we get:

slope = (1310 - 950) / (176 - 128) = 360 / 48 = 7.5

So the correct function is the one that has a slope of 7.5 and a y-intercept that matches one of the rental prices. Looking at the answer choices, we see that only Answer D has a slope of 7.5 and a y-intercept of -10, which corresponds to the rental price of $950 - 7.5(128)$. Therefore:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, we need to find the slope and y-intercept of the function. 

We can use two points from the table to find the slope: 

- Clearwater Lane: $(128, 950)$
- Driftwood Drive: $(176, 1310)$

The slope is given by: 

$$
m = \frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p} = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5
$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the points and the slope: 

$$
r = mp + b \quad\Rightarrow\quad 950 = 7.5(128) + b \quad\Rightarrow\quad b = -10
$$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$$
r(p) = 7.5p - 10
$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the rental price with respect to the purchase price. To find the slope, we can choose two points from the table and use the slope formula: $m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. For example, using the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, we get $m=\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=8$. This means that for every $1000 increase in the purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $8.0. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is of the form $r(p)=8p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can use one of the points and solve for $b$. For example, using the point $(70, 515)$, we get $515=8(0.07)+b$, which gives $b=459.6$. Therefore, the linear function is $r(p)=8p+459.6$, which is closest to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ r(p)=6.5p+440}$.
Response 3:
We can use the two given points to find the slope of the line. For example, using the points $(128,950)$ and $(176,1310)$, we have:

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

So the slope of the linear function is 7.5. 

We can also find the $y$-intercept by using one of the points. For example, using $(128,950)$ and the slope we just found, we have:

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

So the $y$-intercept is $-10$.

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. Using any two points from the table, we can find the slope. For example, using the points $(128,000, 950)$ and $(176,000, 1,310)$, we get:

slope $= \frac{1,310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

Therefore, the linear function is of the form $r(p) = 7.5p + b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can use any point from the table. Using the point $(128,000, 950)$, we get:

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

So the linear function is $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 5:
The slope of the linear function can be found by taking the difference in rental price divided by the difference in purchase price between two points. For example, using the first and second properties: 

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

This means that for every $1000 increase in purchase price, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5. 

To find the y-intercept, we can substitute one of the points into the equation and solve for the y-intercept. Using the first point:

$r(p) = 7.5p + b$
$950 = 7.5(128) + b$
$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and property purchase price is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. Let's take two properties from the table: Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive. The change in rental price is $1,310 - 950 = 360$, and the change in purchase price is $176 - 128 = 48$. Therefore, the slope of the linear function is $360/48 = 7.5$. The y-intercept of the function is the rental price when the purchase price is 0, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, we can eliminate choices B and C. To find the x-intercept of the function, we set $r(p) = 0$ and solve for $p$. Using choice A, we get $0 = 2.5p - 870$, which gives $p = 348$. Using choice D, we get $0 = 7.5p - 10$, which gives $p = 1.33$. Since the purchase prices are given in thousands of dollars, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can calculate the slope using two of the properties listed in the table. For example, using Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, we have:

slope = (1310 - 950) / (176 - 128) = 360 / 48 = 7.5

So the correct function is the one with a slope of 7.5. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
The slope of the linear function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. We can choose any two points from the table to calculate the slope. Let's use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$. The change in rental price is $1310-950=360$, and the change in purchase price is $176-128=48$. So the slope is $360/48=7.5$. 

The $y$-intercept of the linear function is the rental price when the purchase price is 0. None of the properties have a purchase price of 0, so the $y$-intercept is not given in the table. However, we can use the slope and one point on the line to find the $y$-intercept. Using the point $(128, 950)$ and the slope $7.5$, we can write the equation of the line in point-slope form as $r-950=7.5(p-128)$. Simplifying, we get $r(p)=7.5p-10$. 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is: 

$r(p)=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 7.5p-10}$
Response 9:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. This can be calculated by finding the difference in rental prices and dividing by the difference in purchase prices for any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties: 

slope $= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = 6$

This means that for every increase of $1$ in the purchase price (in thousands of dollars), the monthly rental price increases by $6$ dollars. 

The y-intercept of the linear function represents the monthly rental price when the purchase price is $0$. Since this does not make sense in the context of the problem, we can eliminate choices A and D, which have non-zero y-intercepts. 

Using the slope calculated above and the rental price and purchase price of any property, we can solve for the y-intercept. For example, using the first property: 

$950 = 6(128) + b$

$b = -578$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is:

$r(p) = 6p - 578$

Multiplying both sides by $1000$ to get the rental price in dollars gives:

$r(p) = 6000p - 578000$

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as A, and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as B. We want to find P(A|B), which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

We can use Bayes' theorem to find P(A|B):
P(A|B) = P(B|A) * P(A) / P(B)

We know that:
P(A) = 0.309 (from the table)
P(Never) = 0.313
P(B) = 1 - P(Never) = 0.687
P(B|A) = 1 (if a tablet user answered "Always," then they did not answer "Never")

Plugging in the values, we get:
P(A|B) = 1 * 0.309 / 0.687 = 0.44

The closest choice to 0.44 is choice C: 0.45.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's first calculate the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." This would be the sum of the percentages for "Rarely," "Often," and "Always": 

$24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%$

Now, we want to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never." We can set this up using conditional probability: 

$P(\text{Always} | \text{Not Never}) = \dfrac{P(\text{Always and Not Never})}{P(\text{Not Never})}$

We can find the numerator by multiplying the percentage for "Always" by the percentage for "Not Never": 

$30.9 \% \times \dfrac{68.7 \%}{100 \%} = 21.2 \%$

We already calculated the denominator to be $68.7 \%$. Now we can plug these values into the conditional probability formula: 

$P(\text{Always} | \text{Not Never}) = \dfrac{21.2 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.31$

So the closest answer choice is (A) 0.31. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then, we want to find $P(A|B),$ which is given by \begin{align*}
P(A|B)&=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}\\
&=\frac{P(\text{Always})}{1-P(\text{Never})}\\
&=\frac{0.309}{1-0.313}\\
&=\frac{0.309}{0.687}\\
&\approx\boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 3:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as A and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as B. We want to find P(A|B). 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

From the table, we can see that the percentage of users who answered "Never" is 31.3%. Therefore, the percentage of users who did not answer "Never" is 100% - 31.3% = 68.7%. This is our P(B).

From the table, we can see that the percentage of users who answered "Always" is 30.9%. Of these users, we know that they did not answer "Never," so they are included in our event B. Therefore, P(A and B) = 30.9%.

Putting it all together, we get:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% = 0.45

So the closest answer is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then, we want to find $P(A|B),$ which by definition is \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\text{ and }B)}{P(B)}.\] We can find $P(B)$ by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always": \[P(B) = 24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%.\] To find $P(A\text{ and }B),$ we multiply the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never": \[P(A\text{ and }B) = 30.9 \% \cdot \frac{100 \% - 31.3 \%}{100 \%} = 21.2 \%.\] Therefore, \[P(A|B) = \frac{21.2 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.\]
Response 5:
Let $A$ represent the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $N$ represent the event that a tablet user answered "Never." We want to find $P(A|N^c),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." Using Bayes' Theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|N^c)&=\frac{P(N^c|A)P(A)}{P(N^c|A)P(A)+P(N^c|A^c)P(A^c)}\\
&=\frac{(1-0.309)(0.309)}{(1-0.309)(0.309)+0.243(0.243)+0.135(0.135)}\\
&\approx 0.38.
\end{align*}Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.$
Response 6:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is given by \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\]Note that $A\cap B$ is the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and did not answer "Never," which occurs with probability $30.9\%.$ Also, $B$ is the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never," which occurs with probability $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%.$ Therefore, we have \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.38}.\]
Response 7:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." Using Bayes' Theorem, we have: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$We can calculate each of the probabilities on the right-hand side of the equation as follows:

- $P(B|A)$ is the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never," given that the tablet user answered "Always." Since all tablet users who answered "Always" did not answer "Never," we have $P(B|A) = 1.$
- $P(A)$ is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always." According to the table, this probability is $0.309.$
- $P(B)$ is the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." This probability is equal to the sum of the probabilities of the other three answer choices: $$P(B) = P(\text{Rarely}) + P(\text{Often}) + P(\text{Always}) = 0.243 + 0.135 + 0.309 = 0.687$$Putting it all together, we get: $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}.$

Then, we want to find $P(A|B),$ which by definition is \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.\] We can find $P(B)$ by adding the percentages of tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," which gives $24.3\%+13.5\%+30.9\% = 68.7\%.$ To find $P(A\cap B),$ we can use the fact that \[P(A\cap B) = P(A) - P(A\cap \text{Never}).\] We know that $P(A) = 30.9\%,$ and since the only other option is "Never," we have $P(\text{Never}) = 31.3\%.$ Therefore, $P(A\cap \text{Never}) = 0,$ so $P(A\cap B) = 30.9\%.$ Putting it all together, we get \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}.\]
Response 9:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then, we want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We have:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$

We can find $P(B)$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
P(B) &= 1 - P(\text{Never}) \\
&= 1 - 0.313 \\
&= 0.687
\end{align*}

To find $P(A \cap B),$ we can subtract the percentage of users who answered "Never" from the percentage of users who answered "Always" or "Rarely/Often/Always":

\begin{align*}
P(A \cap B) &= P(\text{Always}) - P(\text{Never}) \\
&= 0.309 - 0.313 \\
&= -0.004
\end{align*}

This doesn't make sense, since probabilities cannot be negative. However, we can see that the percentage of users who answered "Always" is very close to the percentage of users who answered "Never." Therefore, we can estimate that $P(A \cap B) \approx 0,$ and so:

$$P(A|B) \approx \frac{0}{0.687} = 0$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.31}.$

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal.
The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$.
The number of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $240x$.
The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $280+240x$.
We know that this is equal to 270, so we can set up the equation $280+240x=270$ and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
280+240x&=270 \\
240x&=270-280 \\
240x&=-10 \\
x&=-\frac{10}{240} \\
x&=-\frac{1}{24}
\end{align*}
Since $x$ represents the number of cups of Super Grain cereal, which must be positive, we can conclude that Jennifer does not use any Super Grain cereal in her mixture. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$. 

The number of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $240x$. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $280+240x$. 

We are given that $280+240x=270$. 

Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{1}{4}$. 

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal in the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$, and the number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}(1-x) = 280(1-x)$. 

Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the following equation:

$240x + 280(1-x) = 270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{2}$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. The total amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. 

Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the following equation:

$210\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)(1-x)+240x=270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$157.5-157.5x+240x=270$

$82.5+82.5x=270$

$x=\frac{270-82.5}{82.5}=2$

Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 4:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$, and the number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=280-280x$. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $240x+280-280x=280-40x$. 

We know that this is equal to 270, so we can set up the equation $280-40x=270$ and solve for $x$:

\begin{align*}
280-40x&=270 \\
-40x&=-10 \\
x&=\frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}

So Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 5:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. We can set up the equation:
\begin{align*}
240x+210\left(1-x\right)&=270\\
240x+210-210x&=270\\
30x&=60\\
x&=2/4=1/2
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 6:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 
The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each cereal. 
The number of calories from Super Grain cereal is $240x$, and the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=280-280x$ (since there are 210 calories in $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal). 
We know that the total number of calories in the mixture is 270, so we can set up the equation: 
$240x+280-280x=270$
Simplifying, we get: 
$-40x=-10$
$x=\frac{1}{4}$
So Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal in her mixture. 

The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$.

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $280+240x=270$.

Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{1}{4}$.

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in her mixture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. Thus, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal she uses is $(1-x)$ cups. 

The total number of calories in the mixture is the sum of the calories from each type of cereal. We know that one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

$210\text{ calories} \cdot \dfrac{1 \text{ serving}}{\frac{3}{4} \text{ cup}} \cdot (1-x) \text{ cups} + 240\text{ calories} \cdot x \text{ cups} = 270\text{ calories} \cdot 1 \text{ cup}$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$280(1-x) + 240x = 360$

$280 - 280x + 240x = 360$

$60x = 80$

$x = \frac{4}{3}$

We can see that $x$ is greater than 1, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem. Therefore, we can conclude that Jennifer cannot make a mixture with 270 calories per cup. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $240x+210\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=240x+157.5-210x=30x+157.5$.

We know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Therefore, we can set up the equation $30x+157.5=270$ and solve for $x$:

$30x+157.5=270$

$30x=112.5$

$x=3.75$

So Jennifer mixes $3.75$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-3.75=-3$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal, which is not possible. 

Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". 

However, the most likely answer is that there is an error in the problem, and the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture should be 370 instead of 270. In that case, we can solve for $x$ as follows:

$30x+157.5=370$

$30x=212.5$

$x=7.083$

So Jennifer mixes $7.083$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-7.083=-6.333$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

The amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{7.083}{7.083-6.333}=\frac{7.083}{0.75}=9.44$ ounces, which is approximately $\frac{1}{3}$ cup. 

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{1}{3}$ cup.

To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation. The slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$ because we can rewrite it in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of any line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we can check which of the answer choices has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$.

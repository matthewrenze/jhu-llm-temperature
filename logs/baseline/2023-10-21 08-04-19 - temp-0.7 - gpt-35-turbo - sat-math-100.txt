Topic: Math
Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we can use straight-line depreciation method where the camera equipment depreciates at a constant rate. 

After 12 years, the equipment will have no monetary value, so the annual depreciation rate will be $\frac{\$32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$2,700$ per year. 

To find the value of the equipment after 4 years, we need to subtract the depreciation from the original cost. 

Depreciation after 4 years = $4 \text{ years} \cdot \$2,700/\text{year} = \$10,800$

Value after 4 years = Original cost - Depreciation after 4 years = $\$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$

Therefore, the answer is

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
We can solve this problem by using the formula for straight-line depreciation: 

$Depreciation\ rate = \frac{Initial\ value - Residual\ value}{Useful\ life}$

where the useful life is the number of years over which the equipment depreciates. 

In this case, the initial value is $\$ 32,400$, the residual value is $\$ 0$, and the useful life is 12 years. Therefore, the depreciation rate is:

$Depreciation\ rate = \frac{\$ 32,400 - \$ 0}{12\ years} = \$ 2,700$

This means that the value of the equipment decreases by $\$ 2,700$ per year. 

To find the value of the equipment after 4 years, we can subtract the total depreciation over those 4 years from the initial value:

$Value\ after\ 4\ years = \$ 32,400 - 4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can use the straight-line depreciation method to find the value of the equipment after 4 years. The equipment depreciates by an equal amount each year, so the amount of depreciation per year is $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700$.

After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4 \cdot \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$, so its value is $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let the radius of the base of the can be $r$. The volume of the syrup in the can is given by $\pi r^2 h = 750\pi$ since the height of the can is $10$ cm. We know that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. So, the volume of the part of the can that is filled with fruit is $750\pi-110$. The volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of the part of the can that is filled with fruit, so it is $750\pi-110$. We can approximate $\pi$ as $3.14$. Therefore, the volume of fruit is approximately $750\times 3.14-110 \approx 185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V = \pi r^{2}h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius of the base is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the volume of the cylinder is $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

We are also given that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top. This volume includes the volume of the fruit as well as the volume of the empty space between the fruit. We want to find the volume of the fruit alone. Let's call this volume $F$. Then we have $F + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, which gives $F = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (D) $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
Response 2:
Let the radius of the base of the can be $r$. We know that the area of the base is $\pi r^2 = 75$.
Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}$.
The volume of the syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.
The volume of the cylinder is $\pi r^2 h = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 \cdot 10 = 750$.
Therefore, the volume of the fruit pieces is $750 - 110 = 640$.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{75/\pi} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Then, the volume of the cylinder is $V = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^2 (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the syrup is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the syrup: $592.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Answer: Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Let's start by finding the volume of the can: 

$V = Ah = (75\mathrm{~cm}^{2})(10\mathrm{~cm}) = 750\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

Let's subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume of the can to get the volume of the fruit: 

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V - 110\mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let r be the radius of the cylindrical can. 

The volume of the syrup is the same as the volume of the cylinder: 

$V_\text{syrup} = \pi r^2 h = 75\pi \cdot 10 = 750\pi \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the empty space in the can is 

$V_\text{empty} = V_\text{syrup} - 110 = 750\pi - 110$

The volume of the fruit is equal to the volume of the can minus the volume of the empty space in the can: 

$V_\text{fruit} = \pi r^2 h - V_\text{empty} = 75\pi \cdot 10 - (750\pi - 110) = 860 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$


Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can, which is given by the formula $V=\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the can. Since the base of the can is a circle with area $75\mathrm{~cm}^2$, the radius is given by $r=\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}\approx 4.33\mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}}=\pi r^2 h\approx 546.13\mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Since the can is filled to the top with syrup, the total volume of the contents (syrup and fruit) is $V_{\text{can}}=V_{\text{syrup}}+V_{\text{fruit}}$, where $V_{\text{syrup}}=110\mathrm{~cm}^3$ is the volume of the syrup. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is $V_{\text{fruit}}=V_{\text{can}}-V_{\text{syrup}}\approx 436.13\mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Finally, since the fruit is made up of separate pieces, we cannot assume that it fills the entire volume of the can. Therefore, the volume of the fruit is an upper bound on the actual volume of the pieces of fruit. The closest choice to this upper bound is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 750\mathrm{~cm}^3}$.
Response 8:
Let's first find the volume of the can using the given information.  
The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula $V=\pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so the radius is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. The height is given as $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. We can now find the volume of the can:
$$V_\text{can} = \pi r^2 h \approx 3.14 \cdot (4.33)^2 \cdot 10 \approx 594 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$
We are told that it takes $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top, so the remaining volume must be the volume of the fruit:
$$V_\text{fruit} = V_\text{can} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 484 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$
Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is:

Action: Answer("D") $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 9:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given information. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is $V = \pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so we can solve for the radius:

\begin{align*}
A &= \pi r^{2} \\
75 &= \pi r^{2} \\
r^{2} &= \frac{75}{\pi} \\
r &\approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}
\end{align*}

Now we can find the volume of the cylinder:

\begin{align*}
V &= \pi r^{2} h \\
&= \pi (4.33)^{2} (10) \\
&\approx 596 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

We are told that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit must be the difference between the total volume and the volume of the syrup:

\begin{align*}
V_{\text{fruit}} &= V - 110 \\
&\approx 486 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve the problem, we can use elimination method by multiplying the first equation by $(-2)$ and adding it to the second equation. We get $-7t=-3$, so $t= \frac{3}{7}$. Then, we can substitute this value of $t$ in the first equation to find that $w = \frac{1}{7}$. Finally, we can compute $2 w+3 t = 2\left(\frac{1}{7}\right)+3\left(\frac{3}{7}\right) = \frac{13}{7}$. Therefore, the answer is C: 13.

Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve this problem using elimination or substitution. Using elimination, we can multiply the first equation by $-2$ and add it to the second equation to get $-7t=-11$, which implies $t=\frac{11}{7}$. Substituting this value of $t$ into the first equation, we get $w=\frac{7}{2}-2\cdot\frac{11}{7}=-\frac{1}{2}$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2\cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)+3\cdot\frac{11}{7}=\frac{13}{7}$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 13}$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is a linear function of the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. Since the table shows a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise, we can use two points from the table to find the slope of the function. Using the points $(5,16.94)$ and $(10,21.89)$, we have $m=\frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5}=0.99$. Therefore, the correct function is $f(x)=0.99x+b$. To find the value of $b$, we can use one of the points and substitute the values of $m$ and $x$ into the equation to get $b=16.94-0.99(5)=11.99$. Thus, the correct function is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?

  A: $x+2 y=a$
  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can first find the slope of the linear relationship by choosing two points from the table. Let's choose $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$. The slope is given by:
$$\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}$$
We can then find the $y$-intercept by plugging in one of the points into the point-slope form of a line. Let's use the point $(a,0)$ and the slope we just found:
$$y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$$
Simplifying, we get:
$$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$$
Multiplying both sides by $-2$ and adding $x$ to both sides, we get:
$$2x-y=a$$
which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}}$.

Response 3:

Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find out whether there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to check if the ratio of the change in $y$ to the change in $x$ is constant. We can select two points from the table, say $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$, and compute the ratio of the change in $y$ to the change in $x$:

$$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$$

This ratio is constant, so there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. To find the equation of the line, we can use the point-slope form:

$$y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$$

where $m$ is the slope we just computed, and $(x_1,y_1)=(a,0)$ is one of the points on the line. Simplifying, we get:

$$y=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$$

Multiplying by $-2$ to get the standard form, we get:

$$2x-y=a$$

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A)}$.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can use unit conversions to solve this problem. First, we convert 2 decagrams to grams:$$2\text{ decagrams}=2\times10\text{ grams}=20\text{ grams}$$Then, we convert 20 grams to milligrams:$$20\text{ grams}=20\times1000\text{ milligrams}=20,000\text{ milligrams}$$Finally, we divide the total number of milligrams by the size of each dose in milligrams:$$\frac{20,000\text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ milligram/dose}}=20,\!000$$Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, and 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 1 decagram is equal to 100,000 milligrams. Therefore, a 2-decagram container is equal to 200,000 milligrams. Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $200,000\div1,000=200$ grams in a 2-decagram container. Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, there are $200\times1,000=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ 1-milligram doses in a 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can use unit conversions to solve the problem. 
- 1 decagram (dag) = 10 grams (g)
- 1,000 milligrams (mg) = 1 gram (g)

So, 1 decagram = 10,000 milligrams. 

Since there are 2 decagrams in one container, there are:

$$2 \text{ dag} \times 10,000 \frac{\text{mg}}{\text{dag}} = 20,000 \text{ mg}$$

So there are 20,000 milligrams in one container. 

Since there are 1,000 milligrams in one gram, there are:

$$20,000 \text{ mg} \times \frac{1 \text{ g}}{1,000 \text{ mg}} = 20 \text{ g}$$

Since there are 1,000 doses of 1 milligram in one gram, there are:

$$20 \text{ g} \times \frac{1,000 \text{ doses}}{1 \text{ g}} = 20,000 \text{ doses}$$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
We can use unit conversions to solve this problem. 

One container of medicine weighs 2 decagrams which is equal to $2\times 10=20$ grams. 

There are $1000$ milligrams in each gram, so there are $1000\times 20=20,000$ milligrams in 20 grams. 

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, we first convert to grams and then to milligrams. Since $1$ decagram is $10$ grams, then $2$ decagrams is $20$ grams. Since $1,000$ milligrams is $1$ gram, then $20$ grams is $20 \cdot 1,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ doses of 1 milligram in one 2-decagram container. 

We can also solve this problem by noticing that there are $1000$ milligrams in $1$ gram, and $10$ grams in $1$ decagram. So, there are $10\times 1000$ milligrams in $1$ decagram. Then, there are $2\times 10\times 1000 = 20,000$ milligrams in $2$ decagrams. So, there are $20,000$ one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 6:
One decagram equals 10 grams, so 2 decagrams equals 20 grams. And 1,000 milligrams equals 1 gram, so 20 grams equals 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Since $1$ decagram $=10$ grams, then $2$ decagrams $=20$ grams. Since $1,000$ milligrams $=1$ gram, then $20$ grams $=20,000$ milligrams. Therefore, a $2$-decagram container holds $20,000$ milligrams. Hence, there are $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 2,\!000}$ $1$-milligram doses in one $2$-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can convert 2 decagrams to grams and then to milligrams to find the total number of milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

$$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams } &= 20 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$ 

Since there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container, we can divide by 1 milligram to find the number of 1-milligram doses: 

$$\frac{20,\!000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 2,000}$$ 

Therefore, there are 2,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 9:
We need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams, and then divide by 1 milligram to find the number of doses. First, we convert 2 decagrams to grams: $$2\text{ dag} = 2\times 10\text{ g/dag} = 20\text{ g}.$$ Then we convert 20 grams to milligrams: $$20\text{ g} = 20\times 1000\text{ mg/g} = 20,000\text{ mg}.$$ Finally, we divide by 1 milligram: $$\frac{20,\!000\text{ mg}}{1\text{ mg/dose}} = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2,\!000}.$$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states ($26.95 \%$) is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
The median is the middle value when the data is arranged in order. Since there are 7 states given in the table, we can find the median by ordering the given percentages from least to greatest and then finding the middle value. 

The ordered percentages are: $19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$. The middle value is $27.9\%$, which is the median for these 7 states. 

The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95\% - 27.9\% = -0.95\%$. However, we are asked for the absolute value of the difference, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 2:
First, we need to arrange the percent of residents in ascending order: $19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, and $36.4 \%$. The median of the 7 states is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median of the 7 states and the median of all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C") 

We first need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014. The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05,$ or $5\%.$ Letting $x$ represent the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we are given that $2(0.05) = 0.10 = x(5880).$ Solving for $x$ yields $x = \frac{1}{588}.$ Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is $5880 + \frac{1}{588}(5880) \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }6,440}.$
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C") 

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. 
Then we have: 

- From 2012 to 2013, the percent increase was (5880-5600)/5600 = 0.05 = 5%.
- Let y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2y.
- So, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014: 

2y = 2((x-5880)/5880) 

y = (x-5880)/5880 

- Therefore, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is (x-5880)/5880.
- The total percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is the sum of the percent increases from 2012 to 2013 and from 2013 to 2014: 

5% + (x-5880)/5880 = 2y + 5% 

Solving for y, we get: 

y = (x-6156)/6156 

- Substituting this into the equation above, we get: 

5% + (x-5880)/5880 = 2(x-6156)/6156 + 5% 

Solving for x, we get: 

x = 6,440 

Therefore, the manager expected 6,440 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")  

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x. The number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be $5,880(1 + x)(1 + 2x)$. Since the manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, we have $$2x = 2(1+x) \Rightarrow x = 2.$$ Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be $5,880(1 + 2)(1 + 2\cdot 2) = 6,440$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}}$.
Response 3:
Since there is no data for 2014, the manager needs to estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. To do this, let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013, and y be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. From the given information, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5880 - 5600)/5600 = 0.05 = 5%, and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is (y - x)/x. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014, so we have:

0.05 = 2((y - x)/x)
0.025x = y - x
1.025x = y

Substituting x = 5880, we get:

y = 1.025(5880) = 6015

Therefore, the manager expected 6,015 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") - The closest answer is A: 6,020, but the correct answer is 6,015.
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and then use that to estimate the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. 

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is: 
\begin{align*}
\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\cdot100\% &\approx 5\%
\end{align*}

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, according to the problem, we have: 
\begin{align*}
2(5\%) &= x \\
10\% &= x \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, we expect the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 to be: 
\begin{align*}
5880 + (10\%\cdot5880) &= 5880 + 588 \\
&= 6468
\end{align*}

Answer: Answer("D") 6,468
Response 5:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. We can do this by finding the difference between the two values, dividing by the original value, and multiplying by 100:
$$\frac{5880-5600}{5600}\times 100\%=5\%$$
Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is estimated to be:
$$x+2\%\times x=x+0.02x=1.02x$$
We can now set up an equation using the information given in the problem:
$$1.02x=\frac{6240-5880}{5880}\times 100\%\times 5880+5880$$
Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$1.02x\approx 6468$$
Dividing both sides by 1.02, we get:
$$x\approx 6341.18$$
Therefore, the manager expected approximately 1.02x or about 1.02(6341.18) = 6467.7, which is closest to 6,468. Thus, the answer is (D) 6,468. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 2x. From the table, the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 is 5,880, and the number sold in 2012 is 5,600. The number sold in 2014 is approximately $5,880 \cdot (1+x)\cdot (1+2x)$. We estimate $x$ by averaging the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Since the number of subscriptions can't be negative, we choose the answer choice that is closest to this estimate.

\begin{align*}
\text{Estimate for }x &= \frac{\text{percent increase from 2012 to 2013} + \text{percent increase from 2013 to 2014}}{2} \\
&= \frac{(5880-5600)/5600 + x}{2} \\
&= \frac{1}{280} + \frac{x}{2} \\
\end{align*}

Thus, we estimate the number sold in 2014 to be approximately $5,880 \cdot (1+x)\cdot (1+2x) \approx 6480$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
First, we need to find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 by using the formula: 

percent increase $= \dfrac{\text{new value} - \text{old value}}{\text{old value}} \times 100\%$

percent increase $= \dfrac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be $x + 2\%\cdot x = x(1 + 0.02\cdot 1) = 1.02x.$

We want to find $1.02x.$

Since we know that there was a 5% increase from 2012 to 2013, we can write:

$x = 5,880(1 + 0.05) \approx 6,174$

Therefore, we have:

$1.02x = 1.02(6,174) \approx 6,279$

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 8:
Let us first calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. 

$(\frac{5880-5600}{5600})\times 100\% = 5\%$

Let us assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $x\%$. 

Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2x\%$. 

We can calculate the subscriptions sold in 2014 as follows: 

$5880(1+\frac{x}{100})(1+\frac{2x}{100})$

$= 5880(1+\frac{3x}{100}+\frac{2x^2}{10000})$

$= 5880+ 176.4x + 11.76x^2$

We know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $5\%$. So, the subscriptions sold in 2013 can be calculated as follows: 

$5600(1+0.05) = 5880$

We can now calculate the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 as follows: 

$\frac{5880(1+\frac{x}{100})}{5600}-1 = \frac{x}{100}+\frac{5880x}{5600\times 100}$

$= \frac{7x}{1000}+\frac{147x}{14000}$

$= \frac{287x}{20000}$

We know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. So, we can write: 

$2\times 5 = \frac{287x}{20000}\times 100$

$10 = \frac{1435x}{10000}$

$x = \frac{10000}{1435} \approx 6.97$

Therefore, the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately: 

$5880(1+\frac{6.97}{100})(1+\frac{2\times 6.97}{100}) \approx 6467.75$

To find the rate of depreciation we can calculate the decrease in value per year: 

$\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$

So the value of the machine decreases by $9,000 per year. 

To find the equation that gives the value of the machine after $t$ years, we can start with the initial value of $120,000$ and subtract $9,000$ for each year $t$:

$V=120,000-9,000t$

First, we need to determine the annual depreciation rate. The machine loses $120,000 - 30,000 = 90,000$ dollars of value over 10 years, so it loses $90,000/10 = 9,000$ dollars of value per year. 

We also know that the initial value of the machine was $\$ 120,000$, so the equation that gives the value $v$ of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v = 120,000 - 9,000t$

Therefore, the answer is (B).

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can solve for $x$ in the first equation to get $x=y-3$. Then, we can substitute this expression for $x$ into the second equation to get $\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$. Simplifying this expression yields $5y=\frac{15}{2}$, or $y=\frac{3}{2}$. Substituting this value back into the first equation yields $x=(-3/2)$. Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $\left(-\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{2}\right)$.
 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
We can solve the system of equations by substituting $x=y-3$ into $\frac{x}{2}+2y=6$:
$$\frac{y-3}{2}+2y=6$$
Multiplying both sides by $2$ gives $y-3+4y=12$, or $5y=15$, or $y=3$. Substituting this value for $y$ into $x=y-3$ gives $x=0$.

Therefore, the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $(0,3)$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}}$.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To solve this system of equations, we can substitute the first equation into the second equation, and then solve for y. Once we know the value of y, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for x. 

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{x}{2}+2y &= 6 \\ \frac{y-3}{2}+2y &= 6 && \text{Substitute } x=y-3 \\ y-3+4y &= 12 \\ 5y &= 15 \\ y &= 3 \end{aligned}$$

Now that we know that $y=3$, we can substitute it back into the first equation to solve for x. 

$$\begin{aligned} x &= y-3 \\ x &= 3-3 \\ x &= 0 \end{aligned}$$

So the ordered pair $(x,y)$ that satisfies the system of equations is $(0,3)$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let's start by finding how much Ken earns in the first 10 hours: 
$$E_1 = 8 \cdot 10 = 80$$

Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work at $\$ 10$ per hour. The total amount he earns in a week is: 

$$E_2 = 10x$$

The total earning for the week is given by: 

$$E = E_1 + E_2 = 80 + 10x$$

Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. Therefore, he saves:

$$S = 0.9E = 0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$$

We want to find the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week. In other words, we want to find the least value of $x$ such that $S \geq 270$. We can solve the inequality as follows:

\begin{align*}
72 + 9x &\geq 270 \\
9x &\geq 198 \\
x &\geq 22
\end{align*}

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he worked $10$ hours at $\$ 8$ per hour, so he earned $10 \cdot 8 = 80$ dollars. For the remaining hours, he earns $\$ 10$ per hour. So he earns $x \cdot 10$ dollars for the remaining hours he works. Therefore, his total earning for the week is $80 + 10x$ dollars. Since he saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We need to solve the inequality: $72 + 9x \ge 270$. Solving for $x$, we have $x \ge 22$. Thus, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours. Then, he earned $8(10) + 10x$ dollars. Ken saved $90 \%$ of this amount, so he saved $0.9(8(10) + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want to find the least number of hours $x$ such that $72+9x\ge 270$, which simplifies to $x \ge 22$. Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Ken earned $8(10) + 10x$ dollars in total for the week. He saves $90\%$ of it, which is $0.9(8(10) + 10x) = 72 + 0.9(10x)$ dollars. We want this expression to be greater than or equal to $270$. We can write this as an inequality: $$72+0.9(10x)\geq 270.$$ Simplifying, we get $0.9(10x)\geq 198$, or $x\geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work for the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then he works $10+x$ hours in total, with $10$ hours paying $\$ 8$ per hour and $x$ hours paying $\$ 10$ per hour. His total earnings for the week before savings is $8(10) + 10x = 80+10x$ dollars. Since Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, the amount he saves is $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$ dollars. We want this amount to be at least $\$ 270$. Therefore, we have the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we find $x\geq \frac{198}{9}\approx 22$. Therefore, the smallest integer value for $x$ that satisfies the inequality is $x= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 5:
Let the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week be $x$. Then, we can write an equation for the total amount Ken saves in a week as follows: $$0.9(8 \cdot 10 + 10x) \geq 270$$ Simplifying, we get $$72+9x \geq 300$$ $$9x \geq 228$$ $$x \geq 25.333...$$ Since we want to find the least number of hours Ken must work, we round up to $x=26$. 

Therefore, Ken must work at least $26$ hours for the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
Let the number of hours he works for the rest of the week be $x$. The total amount of money he makes is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so he saves $0.9(80 + 10x) = 72 + 9x$ dollars. We want this to be at least $\$ 270$, so we can write the inequality $72 + 9x \ge 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \ge 22$. The smallest integer greater than or equal to $22$ is $22$ itself. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work for the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked the rest of the week. The total amount of money Ken earned is $(10)(x) + (8)(10) = 10x + 80$ dollars. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, which is $0.9(10x+80)=9x+72$ dollars. We need to solve the inequality $9x+72 \geq 270.$ Subtracting $72$ from both sides, we get $9x \geq 198.$ Dividing by $9,$ we get $x\geq 22.$ So Ken must work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$ hours.
Response 8:
Let's start by finding out how much Ken earned in the first 10 hours:

$$
(\$ 8 \text{ per hour}) \cdot (10 \text{ hours}) = \$ 80
$$

Let $x$ be the number of hours he needs to work at $\$ 10$ per hour to reach the goal of saving $\$ 270$ for the week. He will earn:

$$
(\$ 10 \text{ per hour}) \cdot (x \text{ hours}) = \$ 10x
$$

The total earnings for the week will be $\$ 80 + \$ 10x$. Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, so he saves:

$$
0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) = \$ 72 + \$ 9x
$$

We want to find the least number of hours $x$ such that $\$ 72 + \$ 9x \geq \$ 270$. Solving for $x$, we get:

$$
\begin{aligned} 
\$ 72 + \$ 9x &\geq \$ 270 \\
\$ 9x &\geq \$ 198 \\
x &\geq 22
\end{aligned}
$$

The least number of hours he must work is 22, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 9:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then we can set up the equation $0.9(10\cdot 10+10h) \geq 270$, since he earns $\$10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Simplifying the left-hand side of the inequality, we get $9(10+h) \geq 270$, or $h \geq 16$. The least integer greater than or equal to $16$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } 16}$. 

To check, note that Ken will earn $10\cdot 16 = 160$ dollars for the rest of the week, and $10\cdot 10 = 100$ dollars for the first 10 hours. His total earnings will be $260$, and 90% of that is $234$, which is less than 270, so the answer is correct.

Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can start by setting the equation of the parabola equal to 25, since that's where it intersects the line $y=25$.
$$(x-11)^2 = 25$$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$$x-11 = \pm 5$$
So $x$ can be either $6$ or $16$. To find the corresponding $y$-coordinates, we plug these values of $x$ into the equation of the parabola:
$$y = (6-11)^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad y = (16-11)^2 = 25$$
So the points $A$ and $B$ are $(6,25)$ and $(16,25)$. The distance between these points is:
$$\sqrt{(16-6)^2 + (25-25)^2} = \sqrt{10^2} = \boxed{\textbf{(A) }10}.$$ Answer: A

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
First, we need to find the rate at which the oil and gas production decreased. From 2000 to 2013 is a span of 13 years, and the production dropped from 4 million barrels to 1.9 million barrels. Thus, the decrease rate is $\frac{4-1.9}{13} \approx -0.108$. 

This means that for every year after 2000, the oil and gas production decreased by an average of 0.108 million barrels. We can use this information to create a linear function that models the production. 

The function will have the form $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope (decrease rate) and $b$ is the initial production in 2000. Plugging in the information we have, we get:

$f(t) = -0.108t + 4$

We can simplify this to:

$f(t) = -\frac{27}{250}t + 4$

Comparing this with the given choices, we see that the answer is (B) $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$.

Thus, the best linear function that models the oil and gas production is $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear function, $y=mx+b$, to model the production. Let $t=0$ represent the year 2000 and $t=13$ represent the year 2013. Then, we have two points: $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$. The slope of the line passing through these two points is given by:

$$m=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
We can start by finding the slope of the line, which represents the constant rate of change in the oil and gas production. The change in production over the 13-year period is -2.1 million barrels (4 - 1.9), so the average rate of change is -2.1/13 million barrels per year, or approximately -0.162 million barrels per year. This means that the slope of the linear function should be approximately -0.162. 

We can check which of the given functions has a slope closest to -0.162. 

A: $\frac{21}{130}$ is approximately 0.162, but the slope is positive, so this function does not work. 

B: $\frac{19}{130}$ is slightly less than 0.162, so this is a good candidate. 

C: $-\frac{21}{130}$ has the correct slope, but it is negative instead of positive, so this function does not work. 

D: $-\frac{19}{130}$ is slightly less than -0.162, so this is not a good candidate. 

Therefore, the best linear function to model the oil and gas production is $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To determine the correct function, we need to find the slope of the line connecting the two points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$. The slope is given by:
$$m=\frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$$
The slope of the line is negative because the oil and gas production decreased over time. The y-intercept is 4 because the initial production was 4 million barrels. Therefore, the correct answer is:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
We can see that when $x=1$, $f(x)=5$. When $x$ increases by $2$, $f(x)$ increases by $8$. This means the slope of the line connecting the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $8/2=4$. So, we can find the equation of the line in slope-intercept form: $f(x) = 4x+1$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we need to find the slope of the line that passes through the given points. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$ is given by $\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$. Using the given table, we have:

$\frac{13-5}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4$ 

and 

$\frac{21-13}{5-3}=\frac{8}{2}=4$.

So, the slope of the line passing through the given points is 4. To find the y-intercept of the line, we can use any of the points. For example, using the point $(1,5)$, we have:

$5=4(1)+b$

where $b$ is the y-intercept. Solving for $b$, we get $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is:

$f(x)=4x+1$

Thus, the correct answer is $\textbf{(C)}$ $f(x)=4 x+1$.
Response 4:
Here, we can see that when $x=1$ we get $f(1)=5$, when $x=3$ we get $f(3)=13$ and when $x=5$ we get $f(5)=21$. Therefore, we can see that the slope or rate of change of $f(x)$ is $\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{21-5}{4}=4$. Also, $f(1)$ is the $y$-intercept of the graph. Therefore, using point-slope form of equation of a line, we get:

$$f(x)=f(1)+4(x-1)$$

Substituting $f(1)=5$, we get:

$$f(x)=5+4(x-1)$$

Simplifying the equation gives us:

$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can use the two-point form of the equation of a line to find the answer. 

The slope of the line passing through $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$, so the equation of the line is of the form $f(x)=4x+b$. 

To find $b$, we can substitute one of the points. For example, $5=4(1)+b$ gives $b=1$. 

Therefore, $f(x)=4x+1$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.
Response 6:
We can use the values in the table to find the slope of the function. The slope is the change in $f(x)$ divided by the change in $x$ between any two points. For example, between $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, the change in $f(x)$ is $13-5=8$ and the change in $x$ is $3-1=2$. So the slope between these two points is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. We can verify that this is the same slope between the other pairs of points as well. Since the function is linear, we can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of the function. Using the point $(1,5)$ and the slope of 4, we get:

$$f(x)-5=4(x-1)$$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(x)=4 x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find the equation of a straight line in the form $y=mx+b$ we need to know the slope $(m)$ and the y-intercept $(b)$. We can calculate the slope by finding the difference between the y-coordinates divided by the difference between the corresponding x-coordinates. 

The slope between $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ is $(13-5)/(3-1)=4$. Therefore, the slope between $(3,13)$ and $(5,21)$ is also $4$.

The y-intercept can be found by substituting any point on the line and solving for $b$. Let's use the point $(1,5)$:
$5=4(1)+b$
$b=1$

So the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can use the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept, to write an equation for the function $f$. To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table and apply the formula $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\text{change in }f(x)}{\text{change in }x}$.

Choosing the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, we get $m=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4$. 

To find the y-intercept, we can use the point $(1,5)$ and substitute $x=1$ and $f(x)=5$ into the equation $f(x)=mx+b$ to get $5=4(1)+b$, which gives $b=1$. 

Therefore, the equation for the function $f$ is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we will use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. 

We can find the slope of the line passing through the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$ as follows: 

$$m=\frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4$$

Therefore, the equation of the line can be written as $f(x)=4x+b$. To find $b$, we can use any of the points given in the table. For example, using $(1,5)$, we have:

$$5=4(1)+b$$
$$b=1$$

Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
The probability of a person being chosen from those who recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{164}{200}$ (since there were 36 people who didn't recall any dreams). The probability of the chosen person belonging to Group Y is $\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{68}{125}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams, 11 were in Group Y. Out of the 125 people who recalled 5 or more dreams, 68 were in Group Y. Therefore, out of the total of 164 people who recalled at least 1 dream, 79 were in Group Y. So the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is equal to the number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group Y divided by the total number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams, which is the sum of the number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group X and the number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams in Group Y. 

So, 

Probability = $\frac{\text{Number of People in Group Y Who Recalled 1 or More Dreams}}{\text{Total Number of People Who Recalled 1 or More Dreams}}$

Total Number of People Who Recalled 1 or More Dreams = $28+11+68 = 107$

Number of People in Group Y Who Recalled 1 or More Dreams = $68$

Therefore, 

Probability = $\frac{68}{107}$

Simplifying, 

Probability = $\frac{4}{7}$

Answer: Answer("None of the Above") 

Note: None of the given choices is equal to $\frac{4}{7}$, which is the correct answer.
Response 3:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is equal to the number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams from Group Y divided by the total number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams. Therefore, 

$$\text{Probability}=\frac{68}{39+68}=\frac{68}{107}$$

The closest option is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$. Out of these, the number of people who recalled at least 1 dream from Group Y is  $11+68=79$. Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{79}{164}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the ratio of the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream to the total number of people from both groups who recalled at least 1 dream. Thus, the answer is:

Action: Answer("$\\frac{68}{125}$")
Response 6:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the frequencies in the second column: $39$. 

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is the sum of the frequencies in the second column for Group Y: $11+68=79$. 

So, the probability is: $$\frac{79}{39} = \frac{79}{100}$$ 

Answer: $\textbf{(B)}$ $\frac{79}{100}$
Response 7:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream is the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. From the table, we see that 39+125=164 people recalled at least 1 dream, and of those, 11+68=79 were from Group Y. So the probability is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 8:
Out of the 39 people who recalled at least 1 dream, 68-11=57 people were from Group Y. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{200-36}{200}=\frac{8}{11}.$ The probability that a person belonged to Group Y given that he/she recalled at least 1 dream is
\begin{align*} \frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}&=\frac{68/100\times 100}{125}\\ &=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}. \end{align*}

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
To solve the problem, we will need to find the charge for each person and then find the difference. 

Let's start by finding the charge for Mr. Roland's job. Let $t$ be the number of hours that the electrician worked on his job. Then, we have:

$$C_R=75t+125$$

Now, let's find the charge for Ms. Sanchez's job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on her job, so the number of hours he worked on her job is $t+2$. Therefore, we have:

$$C_S=75(t+2)+125=75t+225$$

Now, let's find the difference between the two charges:

$$C_S-C_R=(75t+225)-(75t+125)=100$$

So, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the Above")  (since none of the choices matches the result)
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we need to first find the amount of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland's job. Let $h_1$ be the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland's job. Then we have $h_1 + 2$ as the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez's job. 

The cost for Mr. Roland's job is given by $C_1 = 75h_1 + 125$, and the cost for Ms. Sanchez's job is given by $C_2 = 75(h_1 + 2) + 125 = 75h_1 + 275$.

So the difference in cost is $C_2 - C_1 = (75h_1 + 275) - (75h_1 + 125) = 150$.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. We can use the given equation, where $h$ is the number of hours worked on his job:
$$C = 75h + 125$$
For Ms. Sanchez's job, we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer. So the number of hours worked on her job is $h+2$. Plugging this into the equation, we get:
$$C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 225$$
So Ms. Sanchez was charged $\$225$ and Mr. Roland was charged $\$C$.

To find the difference in their charges, we can subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$225 - (75h+125) = 100 + 75h$$
So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100 + 75h$ more than he charged Mr. Roland.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")   $\$150$
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the cost of Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked for $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job, then he worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. Therefore, we can write two equations:
$$C_R=75h+125$$
$$C_S=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$
We want to know how much more Ms. Sanchez was charged than Mr. Roland, so we need to find the difference $C_S-C_R$:
$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=100$$
So the answer is $\$100$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the cost of Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland's jobs. 

Let's start by finding the cost of Mr. Roland's job. We know from the problem that the electrician worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. 

So, for Mr. Roland's job: 

$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75(h) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

Now, let's find the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. So, for Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$$C = 75(h+2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 150 + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 275$$

The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland's jobs is: 

$$C_{Sanchez} - C_{Roland} = (75h + 275) - (75h + 125) = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than he charged Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the cost of Mr. Roland's job. If the electrician worked $h$ hours for Mr. Roland, then he worked $h+2$ hours for Ms. Sanchez. 

So, the cost of Mr. Roland's job is: $C = 75h + 125$

The cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is: $C = 75(h+2) + 125 = 75h + 225$

The difference in cost between Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job is:

$$(75h + 225) - (75h + 125) = 100$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we find the difference between the amounts charged for the two jobs. 

Let $h_1$ be the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland. Then, for Ms. Sanchez, the electrician worked for $h_1 + 2$ hours. 

Therefore, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C_1 = 75h_1 + 125$ dollars.

The amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_2 = 75(h_1+2) + 125 = 75h_1 + 225$ dollars.

The difference in the amounts charged is:

$$C_2 - C_1 = (75h_1 + 225) - (75h_1 + 125) = 100 \text{ dollars}$$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Answer: Answer("None of the above") (The answer is not one of the choices given. The correct answer is $\$100$ more.)
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we need to use the equation $C=75 h+125$. Let $h_1$ be the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland and $h_2$ be the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez. We know that $h_2 = h_1 + 2$ (Ms. Sanchez's job took 2 hours longer). 

The amount charged to Mr. Roland is $C_1 = 75h_1 + 125$ and the amount charged to Ms. Sanchez is $C_2 = 75h_2 + 125$. Substituting $h_2 = h_1 + 2$, we get $C_2 = 75(h_1 + 2) + 125 = 75h_1 + 225$. 

So the difference in the amount charged is $C_2 - C_1 = (75h_1 + 225) - (75h_1 + 125) = 100$. Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.

Answer: Answer("None of the above") [The answer is not in the available choices. The correct answer is $\$100$.]
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we need to find the difference between the amounts charged to Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland.

Let $h_r$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is $h_s=h_r+2$.

The amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C_r=75h_r+125$ dollars.

The amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_s=75h_s+125=75(h_r+2)+125=75h_r+275$ dollars.

Therefore, the difference in the amounts charged is $C_s-C_r=(75h_r+275)-(75h_r+125)=150$ dollars.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First, we need to find the amount the electrician charged for Mr. Roland's job. Let's assume he charged $x$ dollars for the job, which means he worked for $h$ hours. Then we can write the following equation: 

$x = 75h + 125$

Now we know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so her job took a total of $(h+2)$ hours. Therefore, the amount she was charged can be written as:

$y = 75(h+2) + 125$

We want to find the difference between the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job, which is:

$y - x = 75(h+2) + 125 - (75h + 125) = 75(2) = 150$

So the answer is C: $\$ 150$.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
We can set up a system of equations to solve for $p$, $f$, and $c$. We know that:

$4p+9f+4c=180$
$f=\text{?}$

We want to express $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. We can solve the first equation for $f$ to get:

$9f=180-4p-4c$
$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 1:
We can set up a system of equations using the given information. Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy (in food calories) from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Then we have:

$E_p = 4p$
$E_f = 9f$
$E_c = 4c$
$E_p + E_f + E_c = 180$

Substituting the first three equations into the fourth equation, we get:

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$
$9f = 180 - 4p - 4c$
$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 2:
We can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem: 
$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$
Simplifying this equation gives: 
$4p + 4c = 180 - 9f$
$4(p+c) = 180 - 9f$
$f = \frac{4}{9}(p+c) - 20$
So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The 180 food calories come entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the amounts of energy, in food calories, coming from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively, so $E_p+E_f+E_c=180$. We can express $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ in terms of the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively, as follows:

$E_p=4p$
$E_f=9f$
$E_c=4c$

We can combine these equations to obtain $4p+9f+4c=180$, which simplifies to $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We are told that $180$ food calories come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the given table, we can write an equation involving $p$, $f$, $c$, and $180$ as follows: $$4p+9f+4c=180.$$Solving for $f$, we have $$9f=180-4p-4c=176-4(p+c)=4(44-p-c),$$so $$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 5:
We know that the energy in the granola bar comes entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the information from the table, we can set up the following equation:
$$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$$
Simplifying the equation gives us:
$$4p + 4c = 180 - 9f$$
$$p + c = 45 - \frac{9}{4}f$$
$$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$
Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 6:
We are told that the 180 food calories come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, and that 1 gram of protein provides 4 food calories, 1 gram of fat provides 9 food calories, and 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 4 food calories. Thus, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. We want to solve this equation for $f$. We have $9f=180-4p-4c=176-4(p+c)$. Dividing by 9, we find $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 7:
We are given that 180 food calories come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the table, we can express the total energy in kilojoules as $16.7(p+c)+37.7f$, since the energy per gram of protein and carbohydrate is 16.7 kJ, and the energy per gram of fat is 37.7 kJ. We know that 180 food calories is equal to $180/4.0=45$ grams of protein or carbohydrate, or $180/9.0=20$ grams of fat. Thus, we have the equations $p+c=45$ and $f=20$. Solving for $p$ and $c$ in the first equation, we get $p=45-c$. Substituting into the expression for the total energy, we get $16.7((45-c)+c)+37.7(20)=16.7(45)+37.7(20)$. Simplifying, we get $c=15$, and therefore $p=30$. Substituting into the equation $f=20$, we get $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$, so the answer is (A). 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
We can set up the equation $4p + 9f + 4c = 180$, since the total food calories in the granola bar come entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Solving for $f$ gives us $f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$. Simplifying the right-hand side, we get $f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. 

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
Let's use the given information to create an equation that relates $f$, $p$, and $c$. We know that the total number of food calories in the granola bar is the sum of the calories from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Using the information from the table, we can express this in terms of $p$, $f$, and $c$ as:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. First, we'll isolate the term with $f$:

$9f=180-4p-4c$

Now we can divide both sides by 9:

$f=20-\frac{4}{9}p-\frac{4}{9}c$

This matches choice (B), so the answer is:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To find the answer, we need to substitute each temperature value into the formula and see which one gives us the value closest to 1,000 feet per second. 

Action: 

Substituting $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$: 

$$a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,052-49.68=1,002.32$$

Substituting $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$: 

$$a=1,052+1.08(-48)=1,052-51.84=1,000.16$$

Substituting $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$: 

$$a=1,052+1.08(-49)=1,052-52.92=999.08$$

Substituting $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$: 

$$a=1,052+1.08(-50)=1,052-54=998$$

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to substitute each answer choice for $t$ in the given formula and find the value of $a$. Then, we can compare the values of $a$ for each answer choice and find the one that is closest to 1,000.

Action: 
Substituting $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a=1,052+1.08(-46) \approx 499.92$ feet per second.
Substituting $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a=1,052+1.08(-48) \approx 498.24$ feet per second.
Substituting $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a=1,052+1.08(-49) \approx 497.4$ feet per second.
Substituting $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a=1,052+1.08(-50) \approx 496.56$ feet per second.

Therefore, the answer is (C) $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, since the speed of sound is closest to 1,000 feet per second at this temperature.
Response 2:
We can solve this problem by substituting each answer choice into the equation and determining which value of $t$ gives a value of $a$ closest to 1,000. 

Substituting $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a = 1,052+1.08(-46) \approx 498$, which is too low.

Substituting $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a = 1,052+1.08(-48) \approx 485$, which is also too low.

Substituting $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a = 1,052+1.08(-49) \approx 480$, which is closer to 1,000.

Substituting $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we get $a = 1,052+1.08(-50) \approx 476$, which is too low.

Therefore, the answer is Choice C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 3:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by evaluating $a$ for each choice and selecting the temperature that gives the value of $a$ closest to 1,000. 

Action: Evaluate $a$ for each choice:
- For $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we have $a=1,052+1.08(-46)=500.32$.
- For $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we have $a=1,052+1.08(-48)=496.96$.
- For $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we have $a=1,052+1.08(-49)=495.28$.
- For $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, we have $a=1,052+1.08(-50)=493.6$.

Action: Answer("C") 

Therefore, the answer is $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ (choice C) since it gives the value of $a$ closest to 1,000.
Response 4:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by solving the equation for $t$:

$$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$

Subtracting 1,052 from both sides, we get:

$$0.08 t=a-1,052.$$

Dividing both sides by 0.08, we get:

$$t=\frac{a-1,052}{0.08}.$$

Now we can substitute 1,000 for $a$ and solve for $t$:

$$t=\frac{1,000-1,052}{0.08}=-650.$$

So the air temperature that results in a speed closest to 1,000 feet per second is $-650^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. However, none of the given choices is close to $-650^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, so the most likely answer is the choice that gives the closest value of $a$ to 1,000 feet per second. To do this, we can plug in each value of $t$ and see which one gives the closest value of $a$ to 1,000:

Choice A: $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

$$a=1,052+1.08(-46)=1,000.32.$$

Choice B: $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

$$a=1,052+1.08(-48)=998.56.$$

Choice C: $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

$$a=1,052+1.08(-49)=997.68.$$

Choice D: $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$

$$a=1,052+1.08(-50)=996.8.$$

Based on these calculations, the air temperature that results in a speed closest to 1,000 feet per second is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by substituting each choice for $t$ in the formula and calculating the corresponding value of $a$. Then we can compare which value of $a$ is closest to 1,000. 

Alternatively, we can use estimation to quickly eliminate some choices. If $t$ increases by 10 degrees, $a$ increases by $1.08 \times 10 = 10.8$. Therefore, we can estimate that for every 10-degree increase in $t$, $a$ increases by about 11. Since we want $a$ to decrease from 1,052 to 1,000, we need to decrease $t$ by about 50 degrees. This means the answer is likely to be around $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that will make $a$ closest to $1000$. We can do this by plugging in each value of $t$ and finding the corresponding value of $a$, then choosing the value of $t$ that gives an $a$ closest to $1000$. However, it is easier to notice that if $a$ is closest to $1000$, then $|a-1000|$ must be smallest. Therefore, we can just plug in each value of $t$ and find the corresponding value of $|a-1000|$, then choose the value of $t$ that gives the smallest value of $|a-1000|$.

To solve the problem for $t$ given $a=1000$, we can substitute $a$ with $1000$ and solve for $t$.

$$1000=1,052+1.08 t$$
$$1.08 t=-52$$
$$t \approx -48.15$$

The temperature closest to $-48.15$ is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f(x)$, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where the quadratic function is given in the form $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Then, $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$, which is the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f(x)$. 

The answer is not one of the given intervals, but we can see that $-3<x<-1$, which is contained in interval $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -3<x<1}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $y = ax^2 + bx + c$, we use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1) = x^2 + 4x + 3$, so $a = 1$, $b = 4$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2} = -2$. 

Therefore, the answer is not one of the available choices, but the correct answer is $x = -2$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola with equation $y = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1) = x^2 + 4x + 3$, so $a = 1$ and $b = 4$. Therefore, $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -2$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-3 < x < 1$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\,-3 < x < 1}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function in standard form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, we use the formula $x=-\frac{h}{2a}$. 
In this case, $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$, $h=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$, and $k=f(-2)=(-2+3)(-2+1)=1$. Thus, the vertex of the parabola $f(x)$ is at the point $(-2,1)$. 
Since $-4<-2<-3$, we can see that the $x$-coordinate of the vertex falls into the interval given in choice (A).
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2") 

We can expand $f(x)$ to get $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex is given by $-b/2a=-4/(2\cdot 1)=-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$. So the answer is (A).
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$. In this case, we have $a = 1$, $b = 4$, and $c = 3$, since $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1) = x^2 + 4x + 3$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x = -\frac{b}{2a} = -2$. 

The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3<x<1$, so the answer is (B).
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola given by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is $-b/2a$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic term and linear term of the expression for $f(x)$, respectively. We can write $f(x) = x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-b/2a=-4/2=-2$. Therefore, the correct answer is $(-3<x<1)$ which contains $x=-2$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the x-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola, we use the formula $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)$. 
Here, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the x-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{b}{2a}=-2$. 
Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-1")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2")  

To find the $x$ coordinate of the vertex of the graph of the quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, the function is $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1) = x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Thus, $x=-\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{4}{2(1)} = -2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, as the $x$ coordinate of the vertex is $-2$.

The equation above represents this situation. If Clayton uses 100 milliliters of the $20 \%$ by mass saline solution, how many milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution must he use?
Choices:
  A: 5
  B: 25
  C: 50
  D: 100
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First, we can simplify the equation as follows:
$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18(x+y)$$
$$0.10x + 0.20y = 0.18x + 0.18y$$
$$0.02y = 0.08x$$
$$y = 4x$$

We know that $y = 100$, so we can substitute that in to solve for $x$:
$$100 = 4x$$
$$x = 25$$

Therefore, Clayton must use 25 milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Substitute $y=100$ and $0.20=20/100$ into the equation and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
0.10 x+0.20(100)&=0.18(x+100)\\
0.10 x+20&=0.18 x+18\\
0.08 x&=2\\
x&=\boxed{\textbf{(B) }25}.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The slope of the line is the increase in monthly rental price divided by the increase in purchase price. 

Let's consider two properties with coordinates $(70,515)$ and $(140,1040)$.

The slope is: 

$$m=\frac{1040-515}{140-70}=\frac{525}{70}=7.5$$

So the function that represents the relationship between $p$ and $r$ is:

$$r(p)=7.5p+b$$

To find the value of $b$, we can substitute the value of $r(p)$ and $p$ with any of the properties given. Let's use $(70,515)$:

$$515=7.5(70)+b$$
$$b=10$$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between $p$ and $r$ is:

$$r(p)=7.5p+10$$

Answer: $\textbf{(D)}$
Response 1:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price, we need to find the slope and the y-intercept of the function. 

We can find the slope by using the formula: $m=\dfrac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$. In this case, the change in $y$ is the change in monthly rental price and the change in $x$ is the change in property's purchase price. We can pick any two points from the table. Let's use the points for Clearwater Lane and Glenview Street:
$$m=\dfrac{1040-950}{140-128}=5$$ 

So the slope of the function is 5.

To find the y-intercept, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line: $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope and $(x_1,y_1)$ is a point on the line. We can use the point $(128,950)$, which corresponds to the Clearwater Lane property:
$$r-950=5(p-128)$$
Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$r(p)=5p+165$$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is $r(p)=5p+165$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate of change of monthly rental price per thousand dollars of purchase price. The slope of the function can be found by calculating the difference in monthly rental price divided by the difference in purchase price for any two properties. For example, using the first and second properties:

slope = (monthly rental price difference) / (purchase price difference)
      = (1310 - 950) / (176 - 128)
      = 360 / 48
      = 7.5

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and purchase price is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
The slope of a linear function that represents a relationship between two variables is equal to the ratio of the change in the dependent variable to the change in the independent variable. In this case, the dependent variable is the monthly rental price $r$, and the independent variable is the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars. The change in $r$ corresponding to a change in $p$ by 1,000 dollars is given by the difference in the rental prices, divided by the difference in the purchase prices. For example, for the first property, the slope is $\frac{950-0}{128-0}=7.42$. We can compute the slope for each property and then find the average:

\begin{align*}
\text{average slope}&=\frac{7.42+7.44+7.35+7.40+7.47}{5}\\
&=7.42.
\end{align*}

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is of the form $r(p)=7.42p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can solve for $b$ using any of the data points. For example, using the first property:

$$950=7.42(128)+b,$$

we get $b=-869.76$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship is:

$$r(p)=7.42p-869.76.$$

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
The slope of the line can be calculated as the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. Let's take two of the properties listed, Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive: 

slope $= \dfrac{1310-950}{176-128} = \dfrac{360}{48}=7.5$

We can use any of the properties listed to find the y-intercept of the line. Let's use Edgemont Street: 

$515=7.5(70)+b \Rightarrow b=-5$

So the equation of the line is $r(p)=7.5p-5$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The slope of the linear function represents the rate at which the monthly rental price changes with respect to the change in property's purchase price. To find the slope, we can use two points from the table, for example, $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$. The change in monthly rental price is $3365-950=2415$, and the change in property's purchase price is $450-128=322$, so the slope is $2415/322\approx7.5$. The $y$-intercept is the monthly rental price when the property's purchase price is 0, which makes no sense in this context. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is: 

$$r(p)\approx7.5p+b$$

where $b$ is a constant. To find $b$, we can use one point from the table, for example, $(70, 515)$:

$$515\approx7.5(0.07)+b\Rightarrow b\approx440$$

Therefore, the best answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$ and the property's purchase price $p$, we need to find the slope and y-intercept of the function. We can use two of the given data points to find the slope: 

Slope = (change in y) / (change in x) = (difference in rental price) / (difference in purchase price)

Let's choose the points for Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive: 

Slope = (1310 - 950) / (176 - 128) = 360 / 48 = 7.5

So the slope of the linear function is 7.5. 

To find the y-intercept, we can choose any of the points and substitute the values into the slope-intercept form of a linear function: 

y = mx + b 

Let's use the point for Edgemont Street: 

515 = 7.5(70) + b 

b = -437.5 

So the y-intercept of the linear function is -437.5. 

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is: 

$r(p) = 7.5p - 437.5$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
We can start by identifying two points on the line. For example, we can use the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, corresponding to the Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive properties, respectively. The slope of the line passing through these two points is given by:

$$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = 6.4$$

Using the point-slope form of a linear function, we obtain:

$$r-950 = 6.4(p-128)$$

Simplifying:

$$r(p) = 6.4p + 2270$$

Converting to thousands of dollars:

$$r(p) = 6.4p + 2.27$$

The closest function to this expression is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ r(p)=6.5p+440}$.
Response 8:
The slope of the function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the corresponding change in purchase price. Looking at the data in the table, we can see that if we increase the purchase price by $1,000$, the corresponding increase in monthly rental price ranges from $515$ to $3,365$. Therefore, the slope of the function is equal to the change in rental price divided by the corresponding change in purchase price, which is $\frac{3365-515}{450-70}=6$. The $y$-intercept of the function is the rental price when $p=0$. Since the rental price is not defined when the purchase price is $0$, the function should have no $y$-intercept. So, the function is of the form $r(p)=6p+k$. To find the value of $k$, we can use the data from any of the properties. For example, using the data from the property on Clearwater Lane, we have $950=6(128)+k$, which gives $k=-698$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars is:

$$r(p)=6p-698$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can start by finding the slope of the linear function. The slope would represent the increase in monthly rental price for every increase in purchase price of one thousand dollars. To find the slope, we can choose two points from the table and calculate the difference in rental price divided by the difference in purchase price in thousands of dollars. For example, we can choose the points for Clearwater Lane and Hamilton Circle: 

slope = (3365 - 950) / (450 - 128) = 7.5

So the slope is 7.5, which means for every increase in purchase price of one thousand dollars, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5 \times 1000 = 750$ dollars. 

To find the y-intercept, we can choose one point from the table and substitute the values of $p$ and $r$ into the equation $r(p) = mp + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. For example, we can choose the point for Edgemont Street: 

$515 = 7.5 \times 70 + b$

$b = -10$

So the y-intercept is $-10$. 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price $r$ and purchase price $p$ is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

To solve this problem, we need to find Nate's speed in meters per second and then multiply by the time in seconds for 4 minutes. We know that Nate walks 25 meters in 13.7 seconds, so:

Speed = Distance / Time = 25 meters / 13.7 seconds = 1.82 meters per second

We need to convert 4 minutes to seconds:

4 minutes * 60 seconds/minute = 240 seconds

Now, we can find the distance Nate will walk in 4 minutes:

Distance = Speed * Time = 1.82 meters/second * 240 seconds = 436.8 meters

Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then, we want to find $P(A|B),$ which by definition is $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$ We can find $P(B)$ by adding the percentages for "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," which gives $24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%.$ To find $P(A \cap B),$ we can subtract the percentage of users who answered "Never" from the percentage who answered "Always," which gives $30.9 \% - 31.3 \% = -0.4 \%.$ However, since probabilities cannot be negative, we know that $P(A \cap B) = 0.$ Thus, $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0}{68.7 \%} = \boxed{0\%}.$$ Answer: \boxed{0\%}.
Response 1:
Let $A$ be the event that the tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We can use Bayes' Theorem to solve for this quantity: $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}.$$We can find each of the three probabilities on the right-hand side of the equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
P(B|A)&=\frac{\text{number of tablet users who answered "Always" or "Often" out of those who answered "Always"}}{\text{total number of tablet users who did not answer "Never"}}\\
&=\frac{13.5 \% + 30.9 \%}{100 \% - 31.3 \%}\\
&\approx 54.98 \%\\
P(A)&=30.9 \%\\
P(B)&=1-P(\text{Never})=1-31.3 \%\\
&\approx 68.7 \%
\end{align*}Therefore, $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.38}.$$
Response 2:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as $B$. We want to find $P(A|B)$. 

Using Bayes' Theorem: 

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We can calculate each of these probabilities based on the information given in the table:

- $P(A) = 0.309$
- $P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$
- $P(B|A) = 1$ (if someone answered "Always," then they did not answer "Never")

Plugging these values into the formula gives:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{(1)(0.309)}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that the tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ Using the formula for conditional probability, we have \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.\] We can compute $P(B)$ by noticing that $B$ consists of the events "Rarely," "Often," and "Always," so \[P(B) = P(\text{Rarely or Often or Always}) = P(\text{Rarely})+P(\text{Often})+P(\text{Always}).\] We can then compute $P(A \cap B)$ by noticing that $A \cap B$ is the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and did not answer "Never," so \[P(A \cap B) = P(\text{Always}).\] Using the table, we find \begin{align*}
P(B) &= 0.243+0.135+0.309 \\
&= 0.687,
\end{align*}and \[P(A \cap B) = P(\text{Always}) = 0.309.\] Therefore, \[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx \boxed{0.45}.\] Answer: C
Response 4:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We're looking for $P(A|B)$. We can use Bayes' Theorem:

$$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$$

We can calculate the numerator as follows:

\begin{align*}
P(B|A)P(A) &= P(B \cap A) \\
&= 0.309
\end{align*}

To find the denominator, we need to consider all the tablet users who did not answer "Never." This includes tablet users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always." So,

\begin{align*}
P(B) &= P(\text{not "Never"}) \\
&= 1 - P(\text{"Never"}) \\
&= 1 - 0.313 \\
&= 0.687
\end{align*}

Putting it all together, we get:

\begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{0.309}{0.687} \\
&\approx 0.45
\end{align*}

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.

Let's first find the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never". This would be the sum of the percentages for "Rarely", "Often", and "Always":

$24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \% = 68.7 \%$

So, we know that the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never" is $68.7 \%$. 

Now, we need to find the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that they did not answer "Never". We can do this by dividing the percentage of users who answered "Always" (given that they did not answer "Never") by the percentage of users who did not answer "Never":

$\dfrac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.450$

So the closest answer is (C) 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Total percentage of users who did not answer "Never" is $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. 
Out of those users, the percentage who answered "Always" is $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.449 \approx 0.45$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $N$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Never." We want to find $P(A|N^c),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." Using Bayes' theorem,\begin{align*}
P(A|N^c) &= \frac{P(N^c|A)P(A)}{P(N^c)} \\
&= \frac{P(N^c|A)P(A)}{P(N^c|A)P(A) + P(N^c|R)P(R) + P(N^c|O)P(O)} \\
&= \frac{(1-0.309)(0.309)}{(1-0.309)(0.309) + 0.243(0.243) + 0.135(0.135)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 8:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B)$. Using Bayes' theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B)&=\frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}\\
&=\frac{P(A)}{P(B)}\cdot \frac{P(B|A)}{P(A|B)}\\
&=\frac{0.309}{1-0.313}\cdot \frac{1-0.313}{0.309}\\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 9:
Let's denote the event that a user answered "Always" by $A$ and the event that a user did not answer "Never" by $N$. Then, we are looking for the conditional probability $P(A|N)$. We can use Bayes' theorem to find this probability:

$$P(A|N) = \frac{P(N|A)P(A)}{P(N)}$$

We can find each of the terms on the right-hand side of this equation using the information in the table. 

$P(A)$ is given as $30.9\%$, which is equivalent to $0.309$. 

$P(N|A)$ is the probability that a user did not answer "Never" given that they answered "Always". Since all users who answered "Always" also did not answer "Never," $P(N|A) = 1$. 

To find $P(N)$, we need to add up the percentages of users who answered "Rarely," "Often," and "Always":

$$P(N) = 24.3\% + 13.5\% + 30.9\% = 68.7\% = 0.687$$

Now we can substitute these values into Bayes' theorem:

$$P(A|N) = \frac{P(N|A)P(A)}{P(N)} = \frac{1 \cdot 0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) 0.45.

Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we can use the point-slope form of a line, which is: $y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line and $m$ is the slope of the line.

Since the line passes through the origin, we have $x_1 = 0$ and $y_1 = 0$. Thus, the equation of the line is $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x - 0)$, which simplifies to $y = \frac{1}{7}x$.

Now we can check which of the given points satisfies this equation:

A: $(0,7)$: $y = \frac{1}{7}(0) = 0$, not on the line.
B: $(1,7)$: $y = \frac{1}{7}(1) = \frac{1}{7}$, not on the line.
C: $(7,7)$: $y = \frac{1}{7}(7) = 1$, not on the line.
D: $(14,2)$: $y = \frac{1}{7}(14) = 2$, on the line.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is D: $(14,2)$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we can use point-slope form of equation of a line: 
$y - y_1 = m(x-x_1)$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $(x_1, y_1)$ is a point on the line.

We know that the line passes through the origin, so $x_1=0$ and $y_1=0$. We also know that the slope of the line is $\frac{1}{7}$. Substituting these values into the equation above, we get:
$y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x-0)$
Simplifying, we get:
$y = \frac{1}{7}x$

Now we can check which of the given points satisfy this equation:
A: $(0,7)$ - Plugging in $x=0$, we get $y=0$, which does not satisfy the equation.
B: $(1,7)$ - Plugging in $x=1$, we get $y=\frac{1}{7}$, which does not satisfy the equation.
C: $(7,7)$ - Plugging in $x=7$, we get $y=1$, which does satisfy the equation.
D: $(14,2)$ - Plugging in $x=14$, we get $y=2$, which does not satisfy the equation.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is $(7,7)$, so the answer is:

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1 - x$. The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the number of calories from each type of cereal. From the nutrition facts given, we know that the number of calories from $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{3} = 70$ and the number of calories from $\frac{x}{240}$ cup of Super Grain cereal is $\frac{x}{240} \cdot 240 = x$, so we can write an equation:

$$70 + x = 270$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x = 200$. Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{x}{240} = \frac{200}{240} = \frac{5}{6}$ cup.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal and $y$ cups of Super Grain cereal for her mixture. 

We know that a serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories. Therefore, $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} = 280$ calories.

We also know that $1$ cup of Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories.

Since the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, we can set up the following equation:

$280x + 240y = 270$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$28x + 24y = 27$

Dividing both sides by 4, we get:

$7x + 6y = \frac{27}{4}$

To solve for $y$, we need to express $x$ in terms of $y$. We can use the fact that Jennifer uses a total of one cup of cereal for her mixture, so:

$x + y = 1$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = 1 - y$

Substituting $x$ in the equation $7x + 6y = \frac{27}{4}$, we get:

$7(1-y) + 6y = \frac{27}{4}$

Simplifying the equation, we get:

$y = \frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in one cup of her mixture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Let's represent the amount of Super Grain cereal in the mixture as $x$. Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the equation: 

$\text{calories from Crunchy Grain cereal} + \text{calories from Super Grain cereal} = 270$

Since we know that a $\frac{3}{4}$ cup serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories, we can find the number of calories in $1$ cup: 

$\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$ calories per cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Therefore, the number of calories from $1$ cup of Super Grain cereal is:

$240 - 50 = 190$ calories per cup of Super Grain cereal.

Substituting these values into our equation, we get:

$280 + 190x = 270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{3}$ cup

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Since the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, we can write the following equation: 

$240x+210(\frac{3}{4}y)=270(x+y)$

Simplifying the equation, we get: 

$240x+157.5y=270x+270y$

$112.5y=30x$

$y=\frac{2}{15}x$

Since Jennifer needs to find out how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, she needs to find the value of $x$ when $x+y=1$. 

$x+y=1$

$x+\frac{2}{15}x=1$

$\frac{17}{15}x=1$

$x=\frac{15}{17}$

Now that we know $x$, we can find the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture: 

$x=\frac{15}{17}$

$1-x=\frac{2}{17}$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A") ($\frac{1}{8}$ cup)
Response 4:
Let's assume that there are $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Therefore, there is $(1-x)$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the Super Grain cereal and the Crunchy Grain cereal. We know that the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, and we know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. Therefore, the number of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $240x$.

We also know that a serving size of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. Therefore, the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is:

$\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} \times (1-x) = 280(1-x)$

We now have an equation that relates the number of calories from Super Grain cereal to the number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal:

$240x + 280(1-x) = 270$

Solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{3}$

Therefore, the answer is $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Let x be the number of cups of Super Grain cereal that Jennifer mixes.
The total number of calories from Crunchy Grain is $(\frac{210}{3})x = 70x$.
The total number of calories from Super Grain is $240x$.
The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $70x + 240x = 310x$.
We set 310x to 270 and solve for x.
$x = \frac{270}{310} \approx 0.871$
Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is approximately $0.871 - \frac{3}{4} = 0.121$ cups.
To convert to the nearest common fraction:
$0.121 = \frac{121}{1000}$
$1000 = 2^3 \cdot 5^3$
$121 = 11^2$
$121/1000 = 11^2/(2^3 \cdot 5^3) = 11^2/1000$
Thus, the answer is approximately $\frac{11^2}{1000}$ cups, which is closest to $\frac{1}{3}$ cup.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's assume that Jennifer will mix $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

From the nutrition facts on the box, we know that $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$ calories. Therefore, $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal will provide $280y$ calories. 

We also know that the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270. Therefore, $1$ cup of the mixture will provide $240x+280y$ calories. 

Setting these two expressions equal to each other, we get:
$$240x+280y=270$$

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by $10$:
$$24x+28y=27$$

We want to solve for $x$, which represents the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Rearranging the equation, we get:
$$24x=27-28y$$
$$x=\frac{27}{24}-\frac{7}{6}y$$

We know that $0 \leq x \leq 1$, since Jennifer cannot have negative or more than one cup of Super Grain cereal in her mixture. We can use this constraint to solve for $y$.

Since $x$ represents the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, we can set up the following equation:
$$240x=270-280y$$

Substituting $\frac{27}{24}-\frac{7}{6}y$ for $x$, we get:
$$240\left(\frac{27}{24}-\frac{7}{6}y\right)=270-280y$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:
$$\frac{135}{4}-70y=270-280y$$
$$210y=\frac{135}{4}$$
$$y=\frac{27}{40}$$

Therefore, $x=\frac{27}{24}-\frac{7}{6}\cdot \frac{27}{40}=\frac{9}{40}$.

So, Jennifer will mix $\frac{9}{40}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{27}{40}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to get a mixture of $1$ cup that has $240\cdot \frac{9}{40}+280\cdot \frac{27}{40}=270$ calories.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Let's assume that the amount of Super Grain cereal in the mixture is $x$ cups. Therefore, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in the mixture is $(1-x)$ cups. We can then set up the following equation to solve for $x$:

$240x + 210(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying and solving for $x$, we get:

$x = \frac{3}{8}$

Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is:

$\frac{3}{8} \operatorname{cup}$

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x$. 

To find the amount of calories in one cup of the mixture, we can use the fact that the total number of calories is 270. 

We know that one cup of Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories, so the amount of calories from Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $240x$. 

We also know that one serving of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories per $\frac{3}{4}$ cup, which is equivalent to 280 calories per cup. Therefore, the amount of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $280(1-x)$. 

Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the equation: 

$240x + 280(1-x) = 270$

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$240x + 280 - 280x = 270$

$-40x = -10$

$x = \frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}}$.
Response 9:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. 

The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal per cup is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}=280$.

The total number of calories from both cereals per cup is $280+240x$.

Since the total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 270, we can set up the following equation:

$280+240x=270$

Solving for $x$ gives:

$x=\frac{270-280}{240}= -\frac{1}{24}$

Since we cannot have negative amount of cereal, we can conclude that Jennifer didn't use any Super Grain cereal. Therefore, the answer is:

Question: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of which of the following equations is perpendicular to the graph of the equation above?
Choices:
  A: $3 x+2 y=6$
  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
Given the equation $-2x+3y=6$

For any line to be perpendicular to the given line, the slope of the line should be negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line.

The slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}$

The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$

Now, let's determine the slope of each line in the choices and check which line's slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$

A: $3x+2y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{2}$. So, this is perpendicular to the given line.

B: $3x+4y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{4}$ which is not the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. So, this is not perpendicular to the given line.

C: $2x+4y=6$ can be written as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$ which is not the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. So, this is not perpendicular to the given line.

D: $2x+6y=3$ can be written as $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{3}$ which is not the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. So, this is not perpendicular to the given line.

Therefore, the answer is (A) $3x+2y=6$.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation we need to find the slope of the given equation. The slope of the given equation is $m=-\frac{a}{b}=-\frac{-2}{3}=\frac{2}{3}$. A line perpendicular to this line should have a slope of $-\frac{1}{m}=-\frac{3}{2}$. The equation with this slope is $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+b$. Substituting the point $(3,2)$ into the equation we can solve for $b$. We get $b=8.5$. Therefore the equation of the line perpendicular to the given equation is $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+8.5$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To determine which equation is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find its slope, which can be done by rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form: $$-2x+3y=6 \Rightarrow y = \frac{2}{3}x+2$$
The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. To find a line that is perpendicular to this line, we need to find a line with a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. That slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we can check which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$:

A: $3x+2y=6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{3}{2}x+3$
B: $3x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$
C: $2x+4y=6 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$
D: $2x+6y=3 \Rightarrow y = -\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$

The equation that has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$ is A: $3x+2y=6$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find its slope and then take the negative reciprocal. We can rearrange the equation to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$: $$3y=2x+6$$ $$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$ The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to it is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

To check, we can rearrange the equations given in the choices to the form $y=mx+b$ and see which ones have a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. Only choice (C) has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$: $$4y=-2x+6$$ $$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find the slope of the given line and then flip the sign and take the reciprocal to get the slope of a line that is perpendicular to the given line. 

The slope of $-2x+3y=6$ can be found by putting it in slope-intercept form $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$, so its slope is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

To get a line that is perpendicular to it, we must flip the sign and take the reciprocal: $-\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}}=-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to find which of the choices has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

A: $3x+2y=6$ can be put into slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$, so it is perpendicular to the given line. 

B: $3x+4y=6$ can be put into slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line. 

C: $2x+4y=6$ can be put into slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line. 

D: $2x+6y=3$ can be put into slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given line. 

Therefore, the answer is A: $3x+2y=6$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find the slope of the line, which is the coefficient of $x$ divided by the coefficient of $y$. The slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

A line that is perpendicular to this line will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

So, we need to find the equation whose slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find the slope of the equation $-2x+3y=6$.  

$-2x+3y=6 \Rightarrow 3y=2x+6 \Rightarrow y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$

The slope of the equation above is $\frac{2}{3}$. The slope of any line that is perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ which is $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Therefore, the equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$ is of the form $3x-2y=C$ where $C$ is a constant.

### Temperature: 7.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Biologists found a new species of pale shrimp at the world's deepest undersea vent, the Beebe Vent Field. The vent is 3.1 miles below the sea's surface.Approximately how many kilometers below the sea's surface is the vent? ( 1 kilometer $\approx 0.6214$ miles)
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
Response 0:
To convert miles to kilometers, we can multiply the number of miles by 0.6214. 

Action: Answer("D") 

To find the depth of the vent in kilometers, we can multiply 3.1 miles by 0.6214 kilometers/mile: 

$3.1 \text{ miles} \times 0.6214 \frac{\text{kilometers}}{\text{mile}} \approx 1.92 \text{ kilometers}$ 

So the vent is approximately 1.92 kilometers below the sea's surface. Rounded to the nearest whole number, that's 2 kilometers. Therefore, the closest answer choice is D.
Response 1:
We can convert the depth of the vent from miles to kilometers by multiplying by 0.6214. 

Action: Answer("C")  

To get the answer, we can divide the depth of the vent in miles by the conversion factor:

$3.1 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1 \text{ km}}{0.6214 \text{ miles}} \approx 4.99 \text{ km}$

Rounding to the nearest kilometer, the vent is approximately 4 kilometers below the sea's surface. Therefore, the answer is C: 4.

We can solve for $\frac{b}{a}$ by isolating the variable on one side of the equation. 

Multiplying both sides of $\frac{2a}{b} = \frac{1}{2}$ by $\frac{b}{2}$, we get:

$$a = \frac{b}{4}$$

Dividing both sides by $a$, we get:

$$\frac{b}{a} = \frac{4}{1}$$

Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to use linear depreciation. We know the amount of depreciation per year and the initial value of the equipment. 

The depreciation per year is given by:

$Depreciation = \frac{Initial \ Value}{Number \ of \ Years} = \frac{32,400}{12} = 2,700$

So, after 4 years, the value of the equipment is:

$Value = Initial \ Value - Depreciation \times Number \ of \ Years = 32,400 - 2,700 \times 4 = 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let $V$ be the value of the camera equipment after $t$ years. Then, we know that $V$ is a linear function that passes through the points $(0, 32,400)$ and $(12, 0)$, where the units of $t$ are in years. Therefore, we can write:

$$V(t) = mt + b$$

where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. To find $m$ and $b$, we use the two points:

$$m = \frac{0 - 32,400}{12 - 0} = -2,700$$

$$b = 32,400$$

So, the equation for $V(t)$ is:

$$V(t) = -2,700t + 32,400$$

To find the value of the equipment after 4 years, we plug in $t = 4$:

$$V(4) = -2,700(4) + 32,400 = 19,800$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \$16,200}$.

Response 9:
We can solve this problem using straight-line depreciation. Straight-line depreciation means that the equipment depreciates by the same amount each year. 

To find the annual depreciation rate, we divide the initial value by the number of years of useful life: 

Depreciation rate = $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700$ per year

After four years, the equipment will have depreciated by: 

Depreciation = Depreciation rate $\times$ Number of years = $\$ 2,700 \times 4 = \$ 10,800$

The current value of the equipment is the initial value minus the amount it has depreciated: 

Current value = Initial value - Depreciation = $\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$ 21,600$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
Let's first find the volume of the can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base. We're given that the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^2$, so $r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi}$ and $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. Now we can find the volume of the can: $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi \cdot \left(\frac{75}{\pi}\right) \cdot 10 \approx 235.62 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Since the syrup fills the can to the top, the volume of the fruit plus the syrup is equal to the volume of the can: $V_{\text{fruit}} + 110 = V_{\text{can}}$. Solving for $V_{\text{fruit}}$, we get $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \approx 125.62 \mathrm{~cm}^3$.

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: 

$V_\text{cylinder} = \pi r^2 h$

where $r$ is the radius of the base, and $h$ is the height. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we can solve for the radius: 

$A = \pi r^2 \Rightarrow r^2 = \frac{A}{\pi} = \frac{75}{\pi}$ 

$r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$ 

Plugging in the values we have: 

$V_\text{cylinder} = \pi (\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}})^2 (10) \approx 1078 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the total volume of the can filled with fruit and syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} + 1078 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 1188 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The volume of the fruit alone is the difference between the volume of the cylinder and the volume of the syrup: 

$V_\text{fruit} = V_\text{cylinder} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 968 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

Therefore, the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.
Response 2:
Let's call the volume of the fruit in the can "V". We know that the total volume of the can when it's full is the volume of the fruit plus the volume of the syrup. 

The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = Bh, where B is the area of the base and h is the height. So, the volume of the can when it's full is:

$75\mathrm{~cm}^{2} \cdot 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We're told that it takes 110 $\mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup to fill the can to the top, so the volume of the fruit in the can is:

$V = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's first calculate the volume of the cylinder using its height and base area.
Volume of cylinder = Base area * Height

Volume of cylinder = $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ * $10 \mathrm{~cm}$

Volume of cylinder = $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Now, we can calculate the volume of the pieces of fruit by subtracting the volume of the syrup from the total volume of the cylinder.
Volume of fruit = Total volume - Volume of syrup

Volume of fruit = $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ - $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Volume of fruit = $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let $r$ be the radius of the can. We know that the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so we have \begin{align*}
\pi r^2 (10\text{ cm}) &= 110\text{ cm}^3 \\
\pi r^2 &= 11\text{ cm}^2.
\end{align*}We also know that the base of the can has an area of $75\text{ cm}^2$, so we have \[
\pi r^2 = \frac{75}{10} = 7.5.
\]Therefore, $11 = 7.5 \cdot \frac{11}{\pi r^2}$, which gives us $r^2 = \frac{33}{\pi}$.

Now let $V$ be the volume of the fruit in the can. Then \[
V + 110\text{ cm}^3 = \pi r^2 (10\text{ cm}) = 10\pi r^2 = 330.
\]Substituting $r^2 = \frac{33}{\pi}$, we get $V + 110\text{ cm}^3 = 330$, which gives us $V = \boxed{\textbf{(B) }185\text{ cm}^3}$.
Response 5:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the can. We know that the area of the base is $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$, so the volume of the can is:

$V_{can} = A_{base} \times h = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We also know that the total volume of the syrup and fruit in the can is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Let's call the volume of the fruit in the can $V_{fruit}$. Then we have:

$V_{can} = V_{fruit} + V_{syrup} = V_{fruit} + 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

We can solve for $V_{fruit}$ by subtracting $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ from both sides of the equation:

$V_{fruit} = V_{can} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's begin by finding the volume of the cylindrical can using the given information. We can use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is $V = \pi r^{2} h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Since we are given the area of the base instead of the radius, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, $A = \pi r^{2}$, to find the radius. 

$75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} = \pi r^{2}$  
$r^{2} = \frac{75}{\pi}$  
$r \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$ 

Now we can find the volume of the cylinder: 

$V = \pi r^{2} h = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the volume of the fruit is: 

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{total}} - V_{\text{syrup}} = 592 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 482 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ 

So the closest answer is:

Action: Answer("C") 
Response 7:
We can begin by finding the volume of the cylinder using the formula $V = Bh$, where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height. Substituting the given values, we have:

$V = Bh = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the remaining volume must be the volume of the fruit. So, the volume of the fruit is:

$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Thus, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let's use the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$ where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder.
We can find the radius of the base by using the formula for the area of a circle: $A = \pi r^2$. Solving for $r$, we get $r = \sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$ (rounded to two decimal places).
Now we can find the volume of the can by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (4.33)^2 (10) \approx 591.46 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (rounded to two decimal places).
The volume of the fruit in the can is the difference between the volume of the can and the volume of the syrup: $V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481.46 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ (rounded to two decimal places).
Therefore, the answer is approximately $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
We can begin this problem by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the circular base, $h$ is the height of the cylinder, and $\pi \approx 3.14$. Since the base has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, we know that the radius of the base is $\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$. We also know that the height of the cylinder is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}} = \pi r^2 h \approx 596.68 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Since $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, the total volume of the contents of the can is $V_{\text{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 486.68 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. Since the contents of the can consist of both fruit and syrup, the volume of the fruit must be less than $486.68 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

The volume of the fruit can be found by subtracting the volume of the syrup from the total volume of the contents of the can. We already know that the volume of the syrup is $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$, so we have:

$\text{Volume of fruit} = \text{Total volume of contents} - \text{Volume of syrup} \approx 376.68 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$.

Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 23
Response 0:
We can use the given information to solve for the constant $k$. We know that $y=kx$. Substituting the values $y=24$ and $x=6$, we get $24=k\cdot 6$, which simplifies to $k=4$. 

Now that we know $k=4$, we can use the same equation to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$. Substituting $k=4$ and $x=5$, we get $y=4 \cdot 5 = 20$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can start by solving for the constant $k$ since we know $y=24$ when $x=6$:
$k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{24}{6} = 4$

Now we can use this value of $k$ to solve for $y$ when $x=5$:
$y = kx = 4 \cdot 5 = 20$

Thus, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We are given that $y=k x$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$. We can use this information to find $k$ and then use $k$ to find $y$ when $x=5$. 

If $y=24$ when $x=6$, then we have $24=k\cdot 6$, which implies $k=4$. 

Therefore, $y=k\cdot x=4\cdot 5=20$. 

Answer: Choice C, 20.
Response 3:
First we can find the value of $k$. We know that $y=k x$ and when $x=6$, $y=24$. So we can substitute these values to get $24=k \cdot 6$. Solving for $k$, we get $k=4$.

Now we can use this value of $k$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$. We know that $y=kx$ so when $x=5$, we have $y=4 \cdot 5 = 20$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
First, we can solve for the constant k by plugging in the given values:
$k = \frac{y}{x} = \frac{24}{6} = 4$
Now, we can plug in the new value of x to find y:
$y = kx = 4 \times 5 = 20$
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("20")
Response 6:
First, we can solve for $k$ by using the given information that $y=24$ when $x=6$. 

$y=kx$ 

$24=k(6)$ 

$k=4$

Now that we know $k=4$, we can use the equation to find $y$ when $x=5$. 

$y=kx$ 

$y=4(5)$ 

$y=20$ 

So, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("20")
Response 8:
Solution: 

Given the equation of the line, $y=kx$ and the point $(x,y)=(6,24)$ that lies on the line. We can use this point to find the value of $k$:

\begin{align*}
y &= k x \\
24 &= k \cdot 6 \\
k &= 4
\end{align*}

Now that we know $k=4$, we can use the equation of the line to find $y$ when $x=5$:

\begin{align*}
y &= k x \\
y &= 4 \cdot 5 \\
y &= 20
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }20}$.
Response 9:
First, we can solve for the constant $k$:
$y=kx$ can be rearranged as $k=\frac{y}{x}$
Plugging in $y=24$ and $x=6$, we get $k=\frac{24}{6}=4$
Now that we know that $k=4$, we can use it to find $y$ when $x=5$:
$y=kx=4\cdot5=20$
Therefore, the answer is (C) 20.

Solution: 
We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation, which eliminates $w$:
\begin{align*}
-2(2w+4t)+(4w+5t) &= -4w-8t+4w+5t \\
t &= 1
\end{align*}
Now we can substitute that value of $t$ into the original equations to solve for $w$:
\begin{align*}
2w+4(1) &= 14 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = 5 \\
4w+5(1) &= 25 \quad \Rightarrow \quad w = 5
\end{align*}
So we have $w=5$ and $t=1$, and plugging that into $2w+3t$ gives us $2(5)+3(1) = 13$. Therefore, the answer is (C).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  

We can solve this system of equations by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation. This will give us $t=3$. Substituting this value back into the first equation, we get $w=4$. Finally, $2w+3t=2(4)+3(3)=8+9=\boxed{13}$.

Solution: 

Expanding the left side of the equation we get:
$$5ax^3-ax^2b+20x^2+12ax-3bx-12=20x^3-9x^2-2x+12$$

We can see that the $x^3$ terms on both sides cancel out, giving us:
$$(5a-20)x^2=(-a b-9)x+(12 a-3 b)$$

Since this equation holds for all values of $x$, both sides must be equal to each other. Thus, the coefficients of $x^2$ and $x$ on both sides must be equal to each other.

$$5a-20=0 \implies a=4$$

$$-ab-9=0 \implies ab=-9$$

Therefore, $a b = 4 \cdot (-9) = -36$. However, since none of the choices match this answer, we select the most likely answer which is $\textbf{(A)}\ 18$.

Response 2:
The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is the equation of a line that passes through the points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(40, 51.59)$, which is given by:

$$f(x) = \frac{51.59-16.94}{40-5}(x-5)+16.94$$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$$f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is a linear function. The general form of a linear function is $f(x) = mx + b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Using the given information, we can find the slope and $y$-intercept of the function: 

Two points on the line are $(5, 16.94)$ and $(10, 21.89)$. The slope of the line passing through these two points is 

$$m = \frac{21.89 - 16.94}{10 - 5} = 0.99$$

Therefore, the function is of the form

$$f(x) = 0.99 x + b$$

To find $b$, we can plug in the values of $f(x)$ and $x$ for one of the points on the line. Using the point $(5, 16.94)$, we get

$$16.94 = 0.99(5) + b$$

Solving for $b$, we get $b = 11.99$. 

Therefore, the function is

$$f(x) = 0.99 x + 11.99$$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Since there is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise, the function must have the form $f(x) = mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. We can find $m$ by computing the change in shipping charge $\Delta y$ over the change in weight $\Delta x$ for any two points on the line. For example, using the points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(10, 21.89)$, we get:

$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5} = 0.99$

Thus, the slope of the line is $0.99$. To find the y-intercept, we can pick any point on the line and solve for $b$. For example, using the point $(5, 16.94)$, we get:

$b = f(x) - mx = 16.94 - 0.99(5) = 11.99$

Therefore, the function that can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is:

$f(x) = 0.99x + 11.99$

Hence, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 7:
The function that represents the linear relationship between the weight of the merchandise and the shipping charge is of the form $f(x)=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope (cost per pound) and $b$ is the fixed cost. 

From the table, we can see that when the weight is 5 pounds, the shipping charge is $\$16.94$, and when the weight is 10 pounds, the shipping charge is $\$21.89$. Using these two points, we can find the slope: 

$$m=\frac{\$21.89-\$16.94}{10-5}=\frac{\$4.95}{5}=0.99$$

Using the point $(5, \$16.94)$ and the slope $m=0.99$, we can find the fixed cost $b$: 

$$16.94=0.99(5)+b \Rightarrow b=11.99$$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the weight of the merchandise and the shipping charge is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

If there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, which of the following equations represents the relationship?

  B: $x+2 y=5 a$
  C: $2 x-y=-5 a$
  D: $2 x-y=7 a$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To check which of the given equations represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we can use the two-point form of the equation of a line. 
Let's choose two points from the table: $(a,0)$ and $(3a,-a)$. 
The slope, $m$, of the line passing through these two points is: $$m=\frac{-a-0}{3a-a}=-\frac{1}{2}.$$ Now we can substitute the coordinates of one of the points and the slope into the point-slope form of the equation of a line: $$y-0=-\frac{1}{2}(x-a)$$ Simplifying gives: $$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$$ So the equation that represents the linear relationship between $x$ and $y$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ x+2 y=a}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can first look at the differences between the $x$ and $y$ values in the table. We notice that the difference between $a$ and $0$ is $a$, the difference between $3a$ and $-a$ is $-4a$, and the difference between $5a$ and $-2a$ is $-7a$. Notice that the ratio between the difference in the $x$ values and the difference in the $y$ values is the same: $$\frac{3a-a}{-a-0}=\frac{5a-3a}{-2a-a}.$$ Simplifying both sides of the equation gives us: $$\frac{2a}{-a}=\frac{2a}{-3a}.$$ Thus, we see that there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$. To find the equation, we can use the point-slope form of a line. The slope of the line is equal to the difference in the $y$ values divided by the difference in the $x$ values: $$m=\frac{-7a-(-a)}{5a-3a}=-3.$$ We can use the point $(5a,-2a)$, which is one of the points on the line, to find the equation: $$y-(-2a)=-3(x-5a).$$ Simplifying both sides gives us: $$y=-3x+15a-2a,$$ or $$y=-3x+13a.$$ Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 2x-y=7a}$.

Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
To convert from decagram to milligram, we need to use the information that 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams, and 1 gram is equal to 1,000 milligrams. Therefore:$$\begin{aligned}1 \text{ decagram} &= 10 \text{ grams} \\&= 10 \cdot 1000 \text{ milligrams} \\&= 10,000 \text{ milligrams}.\end{aligned}$$So, 2 decagrams is equal to $2 \cdot 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. Since there are 1-milligram doses, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can use the fact that $1 \text{ decagram} = 10,000 \text{ milligrams}$ (since $1 \text{ gram} = 1,000 \text{ milligrams}$ and $1 \text{ decagram} = 10 \text{ grams}$). So, a 2-decagram container contains $2 \cdot 10,000 = 20,000$ milligrams. Since we want to find the number of 1-milligram doses, we divide by 1 milligram: $$\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram}} = 20,000.$$ Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }20,000}$.
Response 2:
We have $1$ decagram $= 10$ grams, so $2$ decagrams $= 20$ grams. 

We have $1,000$ milligrams $= 1$ gram, so $20$ grams $= 20,000$ milligrams.

Therefore, there are $20,000$ milligrams in one 2-decagram container.

Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $\frac{20,000}{1} = 20,\!000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
There are a few steps to solve the problem, but the main idea is to convert the mass of the medicine from decagrams to milligrams, then divide by 1 milligram to get the number of doses.

Action: Answer("C")  

Here's how to get the answer:
1. 1 decagram = 10 grams = 10,000 milligrams (by using the second conversion factor).
2. 2 decagrams = 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams.
3. One 2-decagram container holds 20,000 milligrams of the medicine.
4. Each dose is 1 milligram.
5. Therefore, there are 20,000 doses in one 2-decagram container.
Response 4:
To solve this question, we need to convert 2 decagrams to grams and grams to milligrams. 

$$2 \text{ decagrams} = 20 \text{ grams}$$

Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, we can convert 20 grams to milligrams as follows: 

$$20 \text{ grams} \times \frac{1,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ gram}} = 20,000 \text{ milligrams}$$

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
We can use the following conversion sequence to convert 2-decagram to 1-milligram:$$\begin{aligned}2\text{ dag} &= 200 \text{ cg}\\&= 2,000 \text{ mg} \\&= 2,000,000 \text{ $\mu$g}\\&= 2,000,000,000 \text{ ng}\\&= 20,000,000,000 \text{ pg}\\&= 20,000,000 \text{ doses of 1 $\mu$g}\\&= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }2,\!000}\text{ doses of 1 mg}\end{aligned}$$Answer: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To convert 2 decagrams to grams: $$\begin{aligned} 2 \text{ decagrams } &= 2 \cdot 10 \text{ grams } \\ &= 20 \text{ grams } \end{aligned}$$To convert 20 grams to milligrams: $$\begin{aligned} 20 \text{ grams } &= 20 \cdot 1000 \text{ milligrams } \\ &= 20,000 \text{ milligrams } \end{aligned}$$Therefore, there are 20,000 milligrams in one 2-decagram container. 

Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $\frac{20,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1 \text{ milligram per dose}}=$ 20,000 doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To convert from decagrams to milligrams, we need to use the two conversion factors: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$We can start by first converting 2 decagrams to grams: $$2\text{ decagrams} \cdot \frac{10 \text{ grams}}{1\text{ decagram}}=20\text{ grams}.$$Then we can convert 20 grams to milligrams: $$20\text{ grams} \cdot \frac{1,000 \text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ gram}}=20,000\text{ milligrams}.$$Finally, we can divide 20,000 milligrams by 1 milligram per dose: $$\frac{20,000\text{ milligrams}}{1\text{ milligram per dose}}=20,000\text{ doses.}$$Therefore, there are $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 20,000}$ 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Question: Percent of Residents Who Earned a Bachelor's Degree or Higher\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hlineState & Percent of residents \\\hlineState A & $21.9 \%$ \\\hlineState B & $27.9 \%$ \\\hlineState C & $25.9 \%$ \\\hlineState D & $19.5 \%$ \\\hlineState E & $30.1 \%$ \\\hlineState F & $36.4 \%$ \\\hlineState G & $35.5 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}A survey was given to residents of all 50 states asking if they had earned a bachelor's degree or higher.The results from 7 of the states are given in the table above. The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
To find the median of the 7 states, we need to order the percents from least to greatest: $$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%.$$Since there are an odd number of percents, the median is the middle percent, which is $27.9\%$. The difference between this median and the median for all 50 states, $26.95\%$, is $$27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%.$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
To find the median, we must first order the percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states from least to greatest: $$19.5 \% \quad 21.9 \% \quad 25.9 \% \quad 27.9 \% \quad 30.1 \% \quad 35.5 \% \quad 36.4 \%$$ The median of these values is $27.9 \%$, which is $1.95 \%$ greater than the median for all 50 states. Thus, the answer is:

$$\begin{aligned} &\text{Difference between the medians} \\ &= 27.9 \% - 26.95 \% \\ &= 0.95 \% \end{aligned}$$

Answer: \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}
Response 2:
To find the median, first we need to order the percent of residents in ascending order as follows: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value when the data is ordered, which is $27.9 \%$ in this case. 

The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median of all 50 states is:

$26.95 \% - 27.9 \% = -0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
To find the median of a set of data, we arrange the values in increasing or decreasing order and pick the middle value (or the average of the two middle values, if there are an even number of values). Since there are seven states given, we can find the median by arranging the percents in order from least to greatest: $$19.5, 21.9, 25.9, 27.9, 30.1, 35.5, 36.4.$$ The median is $27.9 \%,$ which is one of the states given. Therefore, the difference between the median of these seven states and the median of all 50 states is $$26.95-27.9=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}.$$
Response 4:
First, we need to arrange the given data in an increasing order: 

State D, A, C, B, E, G, F.

The median of the given 7 states is the middle value, which is the fourth value when arranged in an increasing order.

Hence, the median of these states is $B = 27.9 \%$.

The difference between the given median and the median for all 50 states is: 

$|26.95 - 27.9| = 0.95 \%$.

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To find the median, we need to order the data from least to greatest: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle number: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $\boxed{27.9 \%}$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The difference between $26.95 \%$ and $27.9 \%$ is $0.95 \%$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To find the median of the 7 states, we first need to put them in order: 

$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% \approx 0.95 \%$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 0.95 \%}$.
Response 7:
We need to calculate the median of the seven states given in the table. Arranging the values in ascending order, we get: 

$19.5 \%, 21.9 \%, 25.9 \%, 27.9 \%, 30.1 \%, 35.5 \%, 36.4 \%$

The median is $27.9 \%$.
The difference between the median for all fifty states and the median for the seven states is:

$26.95 \% - 27.9 \% = -0.95 \%$

The absolute value of the difference is $0.95 \%$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
We need to first find the median of the given 7 states: 
$21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%, 19.5\%$. 

Arranging these in order, we have $19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$. The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. 

The difference between the median of these 7 states and the median of all 50 states is $26.95\% - 27.9\% = -0.95\%$. 

Since we are looking for the absolute value of the difference, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
Action: Answer("A")  

We can start by calculating the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: 

Percent increase = $\dfrac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$

Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. According to the problem, we have:

$2(0.05) = (1+ x)^2 - 1$

Solving for x, we get:

$x \approx 0.0975$

So the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is given by:

$5880(1+0.0975) \approx 6020$

Therefore, the answer is A: 6,020.
Response 1:
Unfortunately, the given question is incomplete. The answer cannot be determined without the necessary information about the subscriptions sold in 2014.
Response 2:
We cannot find the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 without more information. Therefore, let’s first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013: $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$ increase. If the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 5%, then the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is 2(5%) = 10%. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is approximately $5,880 + (0.1)(5,880) = 6,468$. Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }6,468}$.
Response 3:
First, we need to find the percent increase in subscriptions sold from 2012 to 2013:
$ \frac{(5880-5600)}{5600} \approx 0.05 = 5\%$
Let x be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then we are given that:
$2(5\%) = 2(0.05) = 0.1 = 10\%$
So the percent increase in subscriptions sold from 2013 to 2014 is 10%. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:
$5,880 + 0.10(5,880) = 6,468$
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D") 

Let X be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, we have:

- The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5880-5600)/5600 * 100% = 5%.
- Let Y be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2Y, which means that:

    (1 + 5%/100%) * (1 + 2Y/100%) = 1 + (2 * 5%)/100%
    
    Simplifying, we get:
    
    1 + Y/20 = 21/20 * 21/20
    
    Y = 21 - 20 = 1%
    
- Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

    X = 5880 * (1 + 1%/100%) = 5880 * 1.01 = 5,928.8
    
Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get X = 6,468, which is answer choice D.
Response 5:
We don't have data on the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, so we cannot calculate it directly. Therefore, we need to use the information given in the question stem to estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Let's call the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 "x".

We know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 was:

$\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} = 0.05$

We also know that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 was half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013. Let's call this percent increase "y". Then:

$y = \frac{1}{2} \times 0.05 = 0.025$

To estimate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014, we need to add the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 to 1, and then multiply that by the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. That is:

$x = (1 + 0.025) \times 5,880 \approx 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected about 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("D") 

Let $x$ be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Then, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{x - 5880}{5880} = \frac{x}{5880} - 1$. The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880 - 5600}{5600} = \frac{28}{525} = \frac{4}{75}$. 

Since the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is double the percent increase from 2012 to 2013, we have:

\begin{align*}
\frac{x}{5880} - 1 &= 2\left(\frac{4}{75}\right) \\
\frac{x}{5880} &= \frac{157}{75} \\
x &= 5880\left(\frac{157}{75}\right) \\
x &\approx 12,\!336 \\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the manager expected 6,468 subscriptions to be sold in 2014, which is answer choice $\textbf{(D)}$.
Response 7:
We cannot find an answer for this question as the table needed to solve the problem is missing. Please provide the table or the necessary information to solve the problem.
Response 8:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
$percent\ increase = \frac{new - old}{old} \times 100\% = \frac{5,880 - 5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% = 5\%$

Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. We need to find x such that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{1}{2} \times 5\%$
$\frac{x - 5,880}{5,880} = 0.025$
$x - 5,880 = 0.025 \times 5,880$
$x = 6,027$

Therefore, the manager expected 6,027 subscriptions to be sold in 2014. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C") 

The problem indicates that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is half of the increase from 2013 to 2014. Let x be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013. Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600}=\frac{280}{5600}=5\%$, and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{2(1\%x)}{x}=\frac{2}{100}=\frac{1}{50}$. We can set up an equation using this information:

$$\frac{2(1\%x)}{x}=\frac{1}{50}$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$\frac{2}{100}=\frac{x}{50}$$

Solving for x, we get $x=100\cdot\frac{2}{50}=4\cdot2=8$. Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 would be $8\cdot(1+1\%)=8.08\approx\boxed{\textbf{(C) }6{,}440}$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
We can begin by using $m$ to represent the amount that the machine depreciates by each year. After 10 years, the total depreciation is $10m$, so the value of the machine is $120,000-10m$. We can set up an equation using this information and the fact that the value after 10 years is $\$30,000$:

$120,000-10m=30,000$

Solving for $m$, we get:

$m=\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$

So the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$. Every year, the value of the machine decreases by the same amount, which means that the machine depreciates linearly. After 10 years, the value of the machine will be $\$ 30,000$. 

We can use this information to find the slope of the line:
$$\text{slope} = \frac{\text{change in value}}{\text{change in time}} = \frac{30000-120000}{10-0} = -9000$$

The negative sign indicates that the value of the machine is decreasing over time. 

We can use point-slope form with the initial value of the machine to get the equation of the line:

$$v-120000 = -9000(t-0)$$
$$v = -9000t+120000$$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$$v = 120000 - 9000t$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $v=120,000-9,000 t$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To find the depreciation per year, we subtract the final value from the initial value and divide by the number of years: $(120,000-30,000)/10=9,000$. This means that each year the value decreases by $9,000$. We can use this information to create an equation for the value of the machine, $v$, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased:

$v=120,000-9,000t$

So the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To find the value of the machine, we need to determine the rate at which it depreciates. We can do this by finding the difference between the initial value and the final value, and dividing by the number of years:
$$\frac{\$120,000-\$30,000}{10}= \$9,000$$
So the value of the machine decreases by $ \$9,000$ each year. 

At time $t=0$, the value of the machine is $\$120,000$. After one year, the value will be $ \$120,000 - \$9,000 = \$111,000$, and so on. Thus, the equation that gives the value of the machine, $v$, $t$ years after it was purchased is:

$$v=120,000-9,000t$$

So the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To find the rate of depreciation, we need to subtract the final value of the machine from the initial value and divide that by the number of years:
$$r = \frac{120000-30000}{10} = 9000$$
This means that the value of the machine decreases by $\$9000$ per year. So the equation that gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased is:
$$v = 120000 - 9000t$$
Therefore, the answer is (B) $v=120,000-9,000t$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work for the rest of the week. Then his total earnings would be $10(x)+8(10)=10x+80$ dollars. Ken saves 90% of his earnings, so his savings for the week is $0.9(10x+80)=9x+72$ dollars. We want to find the least $x$ such that $9x+72\geq 270$, which is equivalent to $9x\geq 198$. Therefore, the least integer value of $x$ that satisfies this inequality is $x=22$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works beyond the initial 10 hours. Then, Ken earns $(8)(10) + (10)(x)$ dollars for the week. He saves $90 \%$ of this, which means he saves $0.9((8)(10) + (10)(x))$ dollars. We set $0.9((8)(10) + (10)(x)) \ge 270$ and solve for $x$. 

\begin{align*}
0.9((8)(10) + (10)(x)) &\ge 270 \\
72 + 9x &\ge 300 \\
9x &\ge 228 \\
x &\ge 25\frac{1}{3}
\end{align*}

The least integer value of $x$ that satisfies this inequality is $26$. Therefore, Ken must work for $10+26=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 38}$ hours or more to save at least $\$ 270$.
Response 2:
Let $h$ be the number of hours he works the rest of the week. He worked $10$ hours earlier this week, so he will have worked $10+h$ hours total for this week. He will earn
\begin{align*}
10 \cdot h + 8 \cdot 10 &= 10h + 80
\end{align*}
dollars during the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings. He will save $0.9(10h + 80) = 9h + 72$ dollars. We want to solve the inequality $9h + 72 \geq 270$,
\begin{align*}
9h &\geq 198, \\
h &\geq 22.
\end{align*}
Thus, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 3:
First, we can find out how much Ken earns in the first 10 hours by multiplying his hourly rate by the number of hours worked: $$ \$8 \cdot 10 = \$80.$$ Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works the rest of the week. Then, he earns $$ \$10 x.$$ In total, his earnings for the week are $$ \$80 + \$10 x.$$ Ken saves 90% of his earnings, so the amount he saves for the week is $$ 0.90(\$80 + \$10 x) = \$72 + \$9 x.$$ We need to find the least $x$ such that $\$72 + \$9 x \geq \$270$. Solving this inequality gives us $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 4:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 hours. We can set up the equation $0.9(80 + 10x) \geq 270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 16$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Let the number of hours Ken worked after the first 10 be $h$.
His total earning for the week is $8\cdot 10 + 10h = 80 + 10h$
He saves $90 \%$ of this so his saving for the week is $0.9(80+10h) = 72+9h$ dollars.
We want to find the least integer $h$ such that 
$$72+9h \geq 270$$
Subtracting 72 from both sides and dividing both sides by 9 give us $h \geq 22$. 
Therefore, the least integer $h$ that satisfies the inequality is $h = 22$.
Thus the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 6:
We can start by calculating how much Ken earns in the first 10 hours: $\$8 \cdot 10 = \$80$. Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Then, the total amount of money Ken earns in the week is $\$80 + \$10x$. Since Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings, he saves $\$0.9(\$80+\$10x)=\$72+\$9x$ per week. We want to find the minimum value of $x$ such that $\$72+\$9x\geq \$270$. Solving for $x$, we get $x \geq 22$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 7:
Let $x$ be the number of hours he works for the rest of the week. The total amount of money he earns in a week is given by $8\times 10 + 10x$. Therefore, the amount of money he saves is:
\begin{align*}
0.9(8\times 10) + 0.9(10x) &\geq 270\\
72 + 9x &\geq 270\\
9x &\geq 198\\
x &\geq 22\\
\end{align*}
Hence, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}.$
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken has left to work. 
The total amount of money he will earn is $8\cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$.
Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings which is $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$.
We need to solve the inequality $72+9x \ge 270$.
Simplifying this inequality we get $x\ge 22$.
The least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let's start by finding Ken's total earnings for the week by using,
$$Total \ Earnings = Earnings \ per \ hour \times Number \ of \ hours$$
So Ken's total earnings for the first 10 hours are $\$ 8 \times 10 = \$ 80$. 
Let $x$ be the number of additional hours Ken works after the first 10 hours. Then, his earning for those $x$ hours are $\$ 10 \times x$.
His total earnings for the week are $\$ 80 + \$ 10x$.
He saves $90 \%$ of his earnings which is $0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x)$. We want this to be at least $\$ 270$, so we can set up the following inequality:
$$0.9(\$ 80 + \$ 10x) \geq \$ 270$$
Simplifying this inequality, we get
$$72 + 9x \geq 300$$
$$9x \geq 228$$
$$x \geq 25.3$$
Since $x$ represents the number of additional hours Ken works after the first 10 hours, it must be an integer. Therefore, he must work at least 26 hours to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week.
So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(None of the above)}}$.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
Response 0:
This problem involves applying the Factor Theorem. Since we are looking for a factor of $f(x)$, we need to find a value of $c$ such that $x-c$ is a factor of $f(x)$, or in other words, such that $f(c) = 0$. Checking the values in the table, we see that $f(4)=0$. Therefore the polynomial $f(x)$ must be divisible by $x-4$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
The function $f(x)$ passes through the points $(0,3)$, $(2,1)$, $(4,0)$, and $(5,-2)$. We want to find a factor of $f(x)$. Notice that $f(2) = 1$ and $f(4) = 0$. Therefore, $(x-2)$ and $(x-4)$ are factors of $f(x)$.  

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Let $p(x)$ be the polynomial. Since $f(x)$ has degree at most $3$ (as there are four data points), we can write $p(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d.$ We can set up a system of equations for $a, b, c, d$:
\begin{align*}
d &= 3 \\
8a + 4b + 2c + d &= 1 \\
64a + 16b + 4c + d &= 0 \\
125a + 25b + 5c + d &= -2
\end{align*}
Solving the system yields $a = -\frac{1}{24}, b = \frac{5}{8}, c = -\frac{49}{24}, d = 3.$ Therefore,
\[p(x) = -\frac{1}{24}x^3 + \frac{5}{8}x^2 -\frac{49}{24}x + 3.\]
We see that $p(2) = 1,$ so $p(x) - 1$ is divisible by $x-2.$ We can also check that $p(x) - 3 = - \frac{1}{24}x^3 + \frac{5}{8}x^2 -\frac{49}{24}x$ is divisible by $x.$ Since this is a multiple choice question, we can try to factor the other answer choices. We see that $p(4) = 0,$ so $p(x)$ is divisible by $x-4.$ We can verify this by using polynomial division or synthetic division. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ x-4}.$
Response 6:
We can see from the table that $f(2)=1,$ $f(4)=0,$ and $f(5)=-2.$ Therefore, $f(x)$ has the roots $x=2,4,5.$ Because $f(x)$ is a polynomial, it is of the form $f(x)=a(x-2)(x-4)(x-5),$ where $a$ is a constant. Thus, $(x-2)(x-4)(x-5)$ must be a factor of $f(x).$ 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
First, we can notice that there are four values of $(x,f(x))$ in the table. Since a polynomial of degree $n$ can be uniquely defined by $n+1$ points, this data is sufficient to define a polynomial of degree 3. Therefore, $f(x)$ must be a polynomial of degree 3 or less.

Now, we can apply the Remainder theorem, which states that when a polynomial $f(x)$ is divided by $x-a$, the remainder is $f(a)$. In other words, $f(a)$ is the value of $f(x)$ when $x=a$.

Using this theorem, we can check which of the answer choices is a factor of $f(x)$ by checking if $f(a)=0$ for $a=2,3,4,5$. We find that:

$f(2)=1$, so $x-2$ is not a factor.
$f(3)$ cannot be determined from the given data, so we cannot determine if $x-3$ is a factor.
$f(4)=0$, so $x-4$ is a factor.
$f(5)=-2$, so $x-5$ is not a factor.

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ x-4}$.
Response 8:
To answer this question, we need to understand that if $a$ is a root of a polynomial $f(x)$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Using this information, we can determine the factors of the polynomial that passes through the given points. 

If $x=0$, then $f(0) = 3$, meaning that $(x-0)$ is not a factor. 

If $x=2$, then $f(2) = 1$, meaning that $(x-2)$ is a factor. 

If $x=4$, then $f(4) = 0$, meaning that $(x-4)$ is a factor. 

If $x=5$, then $f(5) = -2$, meaning that $(x-5)$ is a factor. 

Thus, we know that $(x-2)$, $(x-4)$, and $(x-5)$ are factors of $f(x)$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
Response 0:
Since the line $y=25$ is a horizontal line, we can find the $x$-coordinates where the parabola intersects this line by setting $y$ equal to $25$ and solving for $x$. We get:

\begin{align*}
25 &= (x-11)^2\\
5 &= x-11\\
x &= 16 \text{ or } -6
\end{align*}

So the $x$-coordinates of the points $A$ and $B$ are $16$ and $-6$. The $y$-coordinates of these points are $y_A = y_B = 25$. Therefore, the distance between $A$ and $B$ is:

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{(16-(-6))^2 + (25-25)^2} = \sqrt{22^2} = \boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}
\end{align*}
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can substitute $y=25$ and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
25 &= (x-11)^2 \\
\sqrt{25} &= |x-11| \\
5 &= |x-11| \\
\end{align*}
So the two possible values of $x$ are $x=16$ or $x=6$. Thus the two intersection points are $(16,25)$ and $(6,25)$. The distance between these two points is $\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{100}=10$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
We can start by setting the equations equal to each other:
\begin{align*}
(x-11)^{2} &= 25 \\
\sqrt{(x-11)^{2}} &= \pm \sqrt{25} \\
x-11 &= \pm 5 \\
x &= 6, 16
\end{align*}

So the coordinates of points $A$ and $B$ are $(6,25)$ and $(16,25)$, respectively. Therefore, the length of $\overline{AB}$ is:

\begin{align*}
\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2} &= \sqrt{100} \\
&= \boxed{\textbf{(A) }10}
\end{align*}

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$

Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To find the slope of the linear function, we can use the change in production over the change in time between 2000 and 2013: 

slope $= \frac{1.9 - 4}{2013 - 2000} = -\frac{21}{130}$

Since the production is decreasing, the slope is negative. 

The linear function is of the form $f(t) = mt + b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We are given that the production was 4 million barrels in 2000, so $f(0) = 4$. This means that $b=4$.

Putting everything together, we get:

$f(t) = -\frac{21}{130} t + 4$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To find the correct answer, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$. In this case, we can use the points $(0,4)$ and $(13,1.9)$, since we are given the production in 2000 (which is 0 years after 2000) and in 2013 (which is 13 years after 2000). The slope $m$ of the line is equal to the rate of decrease in millions of barrels per year. Therefore, we have:

$$m=\frac{1.9-4}{13-0}=-\frac{21}{130}$$

Now we can plug in the slope and one of the given points into the point-slope form to find the equation of the line:

$$y-4=-\frac{21}{130}(x-0)$$

Simplifying this equation gives:

$$y=-\frac{21}{130}x+4$$

Thus, the correct answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline1 & 5 \\\hline3 & 13 \\\hline5 & 21 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}Some values of the linear function $f$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following defines $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=2 x+3$
  B: $f(x)=3 x+2$
  C: $f(x)=4 x+1$
  D: $f(x)=5 x$
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to check which linear function satisfies the given data. We can start by checking the slope of the function. The slope can be calculated using any two points of the table. Let's use the first and second rows. The slope is:

 $$\frac{f(3)-f(1)}{3-1} = \frac{13-5}{3-1} = 4$$

So the slope of the function is 4. Now we can eliminate choice D, because it has a slope of 5.

Next, we can use any point of the table and the slope to find the y-intercept. Let's use the first point, $(1,5)$. We can use the point-slope formula:

$$f(x) - 5 = 4(x-1)$$

Simplifying we get:

$$f(x) = 4x + 1$$

So the answer is (C) $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
We can observe that the change in $f(x)$ as $x$ increases by $2$ is always $8$. Therefore, the slope of the line connecting any two of the given points is $\frac{8}{2}=4.$ We can use point-slope form of the equation of a line to know the equation of the linear function $f$ as follows:

\begin{align*}
f(x)-f(1)&=4(x-1)\\
f(x)-5&=4x-4\\
f(x)&=4x+1
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C) } f(x)=4 x+1$.
Response 2:
We have to find a linear function that satisfies the given values in the table. Let's calculate the slope of the line defined by the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$:

$$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=4$$

So, the slope of the line defined by the three points $(1,5)$, $(3,13)$, and $(5,21)$ is also equal to 4. Now we can use the point-slope formula to find the line that passes through the point $(1,5)$ with slope 4:

$$y-5=4(x-1)$$

Simplifying this equation, we get:

$$y=4x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }f(x)=4 x+1}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
To determine the equation of the linear function $f$, we can use the formula for the slope of a line, given by

$$\text{slope} = \frac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}$$

Choosing any two points from the table, we can calculate the slope of the line passing through them. For example, using the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, we have

$$\text{slope} = \frac{13-5}{3-1} = \frac{8}{2} = 4$$

So the slope of the line is 4. To find the $y$-intercept (the value of $f(0)$), we can use any of the points on the line. For example, using the point $(1,5)$ and the slope we just found, we can write

$$5 = 4(1) + b$$

where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. Solving for $b$, we find $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is

$$f(x) = 4x + 1$$

Answer: Answer(C)
Response 6:
One way to solve the problem is to use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation, which is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can use any two points from the table to find the slope, and then use one of the points to find the $y$-intercept. For example, using the points $(1,5)$ and $(3,13)$, we have:

slope $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{13-5}{3-1}=\frac{8}{2}=4$

$y$-intercept $b=f(1)=5$

Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+5$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve this problem, we need to find the slope and $y$-intercept of the linear function. Using the values in the table, we can find that the slope is $\frac{21-5}{5-1}=4$. Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$, we can choose any of the given points, say $(1,5)$, and substitute the slope we just found to get $y-5=4(x-1)$. Simplifying this equation, we get $y=4x+1$, which matches choice $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To find the answer, we need to see which equation describes the function $f$. We can use the two points $(1, 5)$ and $(3, 13)$ to determine the slope of the line and then use the point-slope form of the equation to find the y-intercept. 

Slope:
$$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{13 - 5}{3 - 1} = 4$$ 

Point-slope equation of the line:
$$y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)$$
Using the point $(1, 5)$, we get:
$$y - 5 = 4(x - 1)$$
Simplifying:
$$y = 4x + 1$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ f(x) = 4x + 1}$.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 39 = 29 people are from Group Y. So the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{29}{39} = \frac{79}{107}$$

Therefore, the answer is approximately  $\frac{79}{100}$, which is choice (B). 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Out of the 39 people who reported 1 or more dreams, 68 - 11 = 57 people from Group Y must have reported 1 or more dreams. Therefore, the probability of selecting a person from Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{57}{39+57}=\frac{57}{96}=\frac{19}{32}$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above") 
The answer is not one of the choices provided. The answer is $\frac{19}{32}$.
Response 2:
Out of the 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, 68 - 21 = 47 people who recalled 5 or more dreams belonged to Group Y. Therefore the probability that a person chosen at random who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is $\frac{47}{39+47} = \frac{47}{86} = \frac{79}{164}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Total number of people who recalled at least one dream = 39+125 = 164. 
Number of those people who belonged to Group Y = 11+68 = 79. 

Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{\text{Number of people who belonged to Group Y and recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{79}{164}$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Out of the total of $39$ people, $68-11=57$ people are from Group Y. 

Therefore, the probability is:

$$\frac{57}{39}=\frac{19}{13}$$

However, since the question asks for the probability that the person belonged to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream, we need to focus on the $39$ people who recalled at least 1 dream.

So, the probability is:

$$\frac{57}{39}=\frac{19}{13}\approx\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$$
Response 5:
Out of the 200 people who participated, 39 recalled 1 to 4 dreams and 125 recalled 5 or more dreams. Therefore, the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is 39 + 125 = 164. Out of those, 68 belonged to Group Y. So the probability that a person who recalled at least 1 dream belongs to Group Y is:

$P(\text{Group Y}|\text{at least 1 dream}) = \frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{68}{164} = \frac{17}{41}$

So the best answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
The probability of choosing a person from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is:
\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} &= \frac{68}{39+68+57} \\
&= \frac{68}{164}
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 7:
The probability that a person belongs to Group Y given that they recalled at least 1 dream can be calculated using conditional probability formula; 

probability of Group Y given they recalled at least 1 dream =  probability of (Group Y and recalling at least 1 dream) / probability of (recalling at least 1 dream)

probability of (Group Y and recalling at least 1 dream) = 68/200 = 17/50 (from the table above)
probability of (recalling at least 1 dream) = (39+125)/200 = 164/200 = 41/50

Therefore, probability of Group Y given they recalled at least 1 dream = (17/50) / (41/50) = 17/41

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. This is represented as $\frac{68}{39+68} = \frac{68}{107}$. To simplify, we divide both the numerator and denominator by 1: $\frac{68}{107} = \frac{68\div 1}{107\div 1} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{4}{7}}$.
Response 9:
Out of the total 39 people who recalled 1 or more dreams, $68/(57+68)$ or 68/125 of them belonged to Group Y. This simplifies to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$.

  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to use the given formula to find out how much the electrician charged for both jobs and then take the difference of the two amounts to find how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez.

Let's first find out how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland for his job. We know that he worked $h$ hours on Mr. Roland's job. So, we can substitute $h$ in the formula to get:

$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75 \times h + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

Now, let's find out how much the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez for her job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. So, he worked $(h + 2)$ hours on her job. We can substitute $(h + 2)$ in the formula to get:

$$C = 75(h + 2) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 150 + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 275$$

Now, we can find the difference between the two amounts to get how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland:

$$\text{Difference} = C_\text{Ms. Sanchez} - C_\text{Mr. Roland}$$
$$\text{Difference} = (75h + 275) - (75h + 125)$$
$$\text{Difference} = 75h + 275 - 75h - 125$$
$$\text{Difference} = 150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To solve the problem, we need to first determine how long the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job. Let's call the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job "r". Then, the number of hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is "r+2" (since we know the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job).

Next, we can use the equation $C=75h+125$ to calculate the cost of each job. For Mr. Roland's job, the cost is $C=75r+125$. For Ms. Sanchez's job, the cost is $C=75(r+2)+125$.

To find the difference between the two costs, we can subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$\begin{aligned} C_{\text{Sanchez}}-C_{\text{Roland}} &= \left(75(r+2)+125\right)-\left(75r+125\right) \\ &= 75r+150+125-75r-125 \\ &= \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150} \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than he charged Mr. Roland.
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to first determine the number of hours worked on each job. We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job, so we can represent the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job as $h$ and the number of hours worked on Ms. Sanchez's job as $h+2$. 

We can then use the equation $C=75h+125$ to find the cost of each job. For Mr. Roland's job, we have:

$$C = 75h+125$$
$$C = 75( h ) + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$
$$C = 75h + 125$$

For Ms. Sanchez's job, we have:

$$C = 75(h+2)+125$$
$$C = 75h+150+125$$
$$C = 75h+275$$

So the electrician charged Mr. Roland $\$75h+125$ and charged Ms. Sanchez $\$75h+275$.

To find the difference in cost between the two jobs, we can subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$(\$75h+275) - (\$75h+125) = \$150$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Let's start by finding the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the amount charged is $C = 75x + 125$.
We know that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, so the number of hours worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is $x + 2$. Thus, the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job is $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$.
To find the difference in the amounts charged, we need to subtract the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job from the amount charged for Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$(75x+225)-(75x+125)=100$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above") (since $\$100$ is not one of the answer choices)
Response 4:
Let's start with Mr. Roland's job, for which the electrician worked $h$ hours. We know that Mr. Roland paid a total of $C=75h+125$ dollars.
For Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked for 2 hours longer so the total number of hours worked was $h+2$. We can find the total cost for Ms. Sanchez's job by substituting $h+2$ in the equation for $C$: $75(h+2)+125 = 75h+225$. Therefore, Ms. Sanchez paid $75h+225$ dollars in total.
The question asks for the difference between the amount Ms. Sanchez paid and the amount Mr. Roland paid. We can calculate this difference by subtracting the amount Mr. Roland paid from the amount Ms. Sanchez paid:
$(75h+225) - (75h+125) = 100$
So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the above") (The answer is $\$100$, which is not one of the available choices.)
Response 5:
First, we can find how much the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez by plugging in $h+2$ for $h$ in the equation. So, for Ms. Sanchez we have:
$$C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$$

Now, we can find how much the electrician charged Mr. Roland by plugging in $h$ for $h$ in the equation. So, for Mr. Roland we have:
$$C=75h+125$$

To find the difference in what the two were charged, we can subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$\begin{aligned} C_\text{Sanchez} - C_\text{Roland} &= (75h+225) - (75h+125)\\ &= 100 \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Since the electrician worked $2$ more hours on Ms. Sanchez's job than Mr. Roland's job, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $75(h+2)+125$ and charged Mr. Roland $75h+125$. The difference between the amount Ms. Sanchez was charged and the amount Mr. Roland was charged is:

\begin{align*}
&75(h+2)+125-75h-125\\
&\qquad=75h+150+125-75h-125\\
&\qquad=75(2)\\
&\qquad=\$150
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$150}$.
Response 8:
First, let's find the cost of Mr. Roland's job. Let $x$ be the number of hours he hired the electrician for. Then, the cost of his job is $C=75x+125$. 

Next, we are told that the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job. Let $y$ be the number of hours he worked for Ms. Sanchez. Then, we know that $y=x+2$, since he worked 2 hours longer on her job.

The cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $C=75y+125$. But we can substitute $y=x+2$ to get $$C=75(x+2)+125=75x+175.$$ 

So, Ms. Sanchez was charged $75x+175$ dollars, while Mr. Roland was charged $75x+125$ dollars. The difference in their charges is $$75x+175-(75x+125)=50.$$ 

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$50$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
First, let's find out how many hours the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job:
 - Let $h_1$ be the amount of time (in hours) the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job.
 - Then $h_1+2$ is the amount of time (in hours) the electrician worked on Ms. Sanchez's job.
 
Now we can use the given equation to find out how much each job cost:
 - The cost of Mr. Roland's job is $C_1 = 75h_1 + 125$ dollars.
 - The cost of Ms. Sanchez's job is $C_2 = 75(h_1+2) + 125 = 75h_1 + 275$ dollars.
 
So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $C_2 - C_1 = (75h_1 + 275) - (75h_1 + 125) = 150$ dollars more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy in food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We know that the total energy in the granola bar is 180 food calories, which can be expressed as:
\begin{align*}
180 &= E_p\cdot p + E_f\cdot f + E_c\cdot c \\
&= 4p + 9f + 4c
\end{align*}
Solving for $f$, we get:
\begin{align*}
9f &= 180 - 4p - 4c \\
f &= 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)
\end{align*}
So the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 1:
Let $x$ be the total number of grams of the granola bar. Then, we have the equations:

- Protein: $4p=16.7\cdot x$
- Fat: $9f=37.7\cdot x$
- Carbohydrate: $4c=16.7\cdot x$

Adding the three equations, we get:

$$4p+9f+4c=16.7\cdot x+37.7\cdot x+16.7\cdot x$$
$$4p+9f+4c=70.8\cdot x$$

We know that the granola bar has $x=p+f+c$ grams, so we can substitute to get:

$$4p+9f+4c=70.8\cdot (p+f+c)$$
$$4p+9f+4c=70.8p+70.8f+70.8c$$
$$-66.8p+60.8f-66.8c=0$$
$$-4p+3.65f-4c=0$$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$$3.65f=4p+4c$$
$$f=\frac{4}{3.65}(p+c)$$
$$f\approx 20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$

Therefore, the answer is (A) $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we have to use the information from the table to write an equation that relates the number of grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate in the granola bar to the total number of food calories. We have:

$4p+9f+4c = 180$

Multiplying both sides by $\frac{1}{9}$, we get:

$\frac{4}{9}p+f+\frac{4}{9}c = 20$

Subtracting $\frac{4}{9}p+\frac{4}{9}c$ from both sides, we get:

$f = 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 3:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. We have the system of equations:
\begin{align*}
pE_p+fE_f+cE_c&=180 \\
E_p&=4.0 \\
E_f&=9.0 \\
E_c&=4.0
\end{align*}
Substituting the given values of $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$, we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. 
Solving for $f$, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$ $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 4:
We can set up the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$, since the 180 food calories must come from the sum of the calories in each macronutrient. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}=\frac{20}{9}(9-\frac{4}{9}p-\frac{4}{9}c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B)}$ $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 5:
The number of food calories coming from protein is $4p$, the number coming from fat is $9f$, and the number coming from carbohydrate is $4c$. These sum to 180, so we have the equation $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$ gives $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4p-4c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We are given that the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. Therefore, we know that $4p+9f+4c=180$. Solving for $f$, we have $9f=180-4p-4c$. Dividing both sides by 9, we get $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. 

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 7:
We are given that the amount of energy in a granola bar, which is 180 food calories, is the sum of the energy from protein, fat, and carbohydrate. So we can write:
\begin{align*}
180 &= 4p + 9f + 4c \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 180 &= 4(p+c) + 5f \\
\Rightarrow\qquad 5f &= 180 - 4(p+c) \\
\Rightarrow\qquad f &= \frac{180 - 4(p+c)}{5} = 36 - \frac{4}{5}(p+c).
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 8:
We know that 1 gram of protein provides 4 calories of energy, 1 gram of fat provides 9 calories of energy, and 1 gram of carbohydrate provides 4 calories of energy. Let $n$ be the total number of grams of macronutrients in the granola bar. Then we have:

$$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$$

Dividing by 9, we get:

$$\frac{4}{9}p + f + \frac{4}{9}c = 20$$

Subtracting $\frac{4}{9}p+\frac{4}{9}c$ from both sides, we get:

$$f = 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation that relates $f$ to $p$ and $c$ using the information given in the table. Since we know that the energy in the granola bar comes entirely from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, we can set up the equation:

$4p+9f+4c=180$

Solving for $f$, we get:

$f=\frac{180-4p-4c}{9}$

Simplifying, we get:

$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.

Topic: Math
Context: $$.\begin{aligned}.& S(P)=\frac{1}{2} P+40 \\.& D(P)=220-P.\end{aligned}.$$.The quantity of a product supplied and the quantity of the product demanded in an economic market are functions of the price of the product. The functions above are the estimated supply and demand functions for a certain product. The function $S(P)$ gives the quantity of the product supplied to the market when the price is $P$ dollars, and the function $D(P)$ gives the quantity of the product demanded by the market when the price is $P$ dollars.
Question: At what price will the quantity of the product supplied to the market equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 90$
  B: $\$ 120$
  C: $\$ 133$
  D: $\$ 155$
Response 0:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find a price such that the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. That is, we need to solve the equation $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions, we get: 

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220-P$$

Simplifying this equation, we get $P=133$. Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$ 133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to set $S(P)=D(P)$ and solve for $P$. Substituting the given functions, we have:

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P.$$

Solving for $P$, we get:

$$\begin{aligned} \frac{1}{2} P+40&=220-P \\ \Rightarrow \frac{3}{2} P&=180 \\ \Rightarrow P&=120. \end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded is $\$ 120$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied to the market equals the quantity of the product demanded by the market, we need to find the equilibrium point where $S(P)=D(P).$  
$$.\begin{aligned}.&S(P)=D(P) \\\\ &\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220-P \\\\ &\frac{3}{2} P=180 \\\\ &P=120.\end{aligned}.$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ \$ 120}$.
Response 3:
We need to find the equilibrium price where the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, so we need to find the intersection of the supply function and the demand function. To do this, we set $S(P) = D(P)$ and solve for $P$. 
$$\begin{aligned} S(P) &= D(P) \\ \frac{1}{2} P + 40 &= 220 - P \\ \frac{3}{2} P &= 180 \\ P &= 120 \\ \end{aligned} $$
Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$120$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to find the point where $S(P)=D(P)$. 
Substituting $S(P)=D(P)$ we get, $$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P.$$ Solving this equation for $P$ gives us $P=133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
We can set $S(P)$ equal to $D(P)$ to find the equilibrium price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. So we have:

$$S(P) = D(P)$$
$$\frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220-P$$
$$\frac{3}{2} P = 180$$
$$P = 120$$

Therefore, the equilibrium price is $\$ 120$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We need to find the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, i.e., when $S(P)=D(P)$. Substituting and solving for $P$, we get $$\begin{aligned} S(P) &= D(P) \\ \frac{1}{2} P+40 &= 220-P \\ \frac{3}{2} P &= 180 \\ P &= 120. \end{aligned}$$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B) } \$120}$
Response 7:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of product demanded, we need to find the point of intersection of the two functions. Setting them equal, we get:
$$\begin{aligned}& S(P) = D(P) \\ \Rightarrow & \frac{1}{2} P + 40 = 220 - P \\ \Rightarrow & \frac{3}{2} P = 180 \\ \Rightarrow & P = 120\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of product demanded is $\$ 120$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to set $S(P)=D(P)$ and solve for $P$. 

$$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{3}{2}P=180$$

Dividing by $\frac{3}{2}$ on both sides, we get:

$$P=120$$

Therefore, at a price of $\$120$, the quantity of the product supplied to the market will equal the quantity of the product demanded by the market.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity demanded, we need to find the price that makes $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting the given expressions for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$, we have
$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P.$$
Solving for $P$, we get $P=\$133$. Therefore, the answer is:

Topic: Math
Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
First we can isolate $k$ in terms of $x$ and then substitute $x$ with 9 to get the value of $k$. 

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
$$k=x^2-2$$
Substituting $x=9$ into $k=x^2-2$, we get: 

$k=9^2-2=79$

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve the equation, we can start by isolating $k$:

$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
$$k=x^2-2$$

Substituting $x=9$, we get:

$$k=9^2-2=79$$

Therefore, the answer is (D) 79.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can start by isolating the variable $k$ in the equation $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0.$$ First, we add $x$ to both sides to get $$\sqrt{k+2} = x.$$ Then, we square both sides to get $$k+2 = x^2.$$ Finally, we isolate $k$ by subtracting 2 from both sides to get $$k = x^2-2.$$ 

Given that $x=9$, we can substitute this value into the expression we derived to get $$k=9^2-2=79.$$ 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
To solve the equation $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$, we first add $x$ to both sides to get: $\sqrt{k+2}=x$. Then, we square both sides to eliminate the square root: $(\sqrt{k+2})^2=x^2$. This simplifies to $k+2=x^2$. Finally, if $x=9$, we get $k+2=9^2=81$, so $k=81-2=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 79}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can solve for $k$ by manipulating the equation given. Adding $x$ on both sides, we get $\sqrt{k+2}=x=9$. Squaring both sides, we get $k+2=x^2=81$. Subtracting $2$ on both sides, we get $k=79$. 

Therefore, 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve the equation, we need to isolate k. 
Starting with:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
Adding x to both sides:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
Squaring both sides:
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=x^2$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
Subtracting 2 from both sides:
$$k=x^2-2$$

Now substituting x = 9, we get:
$$k=9^2-2$$
$$k=79$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Squaring both sides of the equation, we have $k+2=x^2=81$. Therefore, $k=81-2=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
Starting from the equation,
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$
Adding x to both sides, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$
Substituting $x=9$, we get:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
Squaring both sides, we get:
$$k+2=81$$
Subtracting 2 from both sides, we get:
$$k=79$$
Therefore, the value of $k$ is 79.
Response 8:
To solve for $k$, we can isolate $k$ by squaring both sides of the equation: 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ (\sqrt{k+2})^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=9$ into the equation above, we get $k=9^2-2=79$. 

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To solve the equation, we can add $x$ to both sides and then square both sides to get rid of the square root: $$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ \sqrt{k+2}^2&=x^2 \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$
Now, we can substitute $x=9$ into the expression we just found to get: $$k=9^2-2=79$$
Therefore, the answer is:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To answer this question, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. Using the given formula, we can set up the equation: 

\begin{aligned} a &= 1,052 + 1.08t \\ \end{aligned}

We can then rearrange the equation to solve for $t$:

\begin{aligned} 1,000 &= 1,052 + 1.08t \\ -52 &= 1.08t \\ t &\approx -48.15 \end{aligned}

Rounding to the nearest whole degree, we get $t \approx -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Therefore, the closest temperature to achieve a speed of 1,000 feet per second is $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can do this by evaluating $a$ for each of the given values of $t$ and choosing the value that makes $a$ closest to 1,000.

Action: Evaluate $a$ for each given value of $t$:
- For $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=1,052+1.08(-46)=998.32$
- For $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=1,052+1.08(-48)=996.48$
- For $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=1,052+1.08(-49)=995.56$
- For $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=1,052+1.08(-50)=994.64$

So the speed of a sound wave is closest to 1,000 feet per second at $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To answer the question, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000 in the equation $a=1,052+1.08t$. 

We can solve for $t$ by setting $a$ equal to 1,000 and solving for $t$:

\begin{align*}
1,000 & = 1,052 + 1.08t \\
-52 & = 1.08t \\
t & \approx -48.15\ldots
\end{align*}

Since none of the answer choices match $t \approx -48.15\ldots$, we choose the closest one, which is:

Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ that results in $a$ being closest to 1,000. This means we need to find the value of $t$ that minimizes the absolute value of $a-1,000$.

Action: Answer("C") 

To minimize $|a-1,000|$, we need to find the value of $t$ that makes $a$ closest to 1,000. We can start by setting $a-1,000$ equal to zero and solving for $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
a-1,000 &= 0 \\
1,052 + 1.08t -1,000 &= 0 \\
1.08t &=  1,000 - 1,052 \\
1.08t &= -52 \\
t &= -\frac{52}{1.08} \approx -48.15
\end{aligned}
$$

So the temperature that results in $a$ being closest to 1,000 is $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Since none of the answer choices match this exactly, we select the answer that is closest, which is (C) $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 67 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form $f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k$, we use the formula $h=-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, we have $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, $h=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. The interval that contains $-2$ is $-3<x<1$, which is choice $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of the form $y=a(x-h)^2+k$, where $(h,k)$ is the vertex, we use $x=-\frac{b}{2a}+h$. In this case, we have $f(x)=x^2+4x+3$, so $a=1$ and $b=4$. Plugging in, we have $-\frac{b}{2a}+h=-\frac{4}{2(1)}+h=-2+h$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. Since $-4<-2<-3$, the answer is A.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ can be found using the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2 a}$ for a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx +c$. Applying this formula to the function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we get $x=-\frac{(3+1)}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$ coordinate of the vertex of a parabola of the form $y=(x-h)^2 + k$ is $h$. Using the formula for expanding the product of two binomials, we get $f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 3$. Completing the square gives us $f(x) = (x+2)^2 -1$. Therefore the vertex of the graph of $f$ occurs at $x=-2$. This is in the interval $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ -4<x<-3}$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function in standard form. In this case, we have $a=1$ and $b=4$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given intervals, but the $x$-coordinate is $-2$. 
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$ where $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is the quadratic function. In this case, we have $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Since $-4<-2<1$, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is in the interval $-4<x<1$. Therefore, the correct answer is (A).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex, we can use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$, so $x=-\frac{4}{2}= -2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in the interval $-4<x<-3$. Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(A)}$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The vertex of the parabola can be found at $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$. So, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{4}{2(1)} = -2$. Therefore, the answer is not any of the given choices as none of them contain $-2$.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of function $f$, we use the formula $x = -\frac{b}{2a}$, where $ax^2+bx+c$ is the general form of a quadratic function. In this case, $a=1$, $b=4$, and $c=3$. Plugging these values into the formula, we get $x=-\frac{4}{2(1)}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$. Choice A is the only interval that contains $-2$.

Response 2:
First, we can simplify the equation: $$0.10x+0.20y=0.18(x+y)$$ $$0.10x+0.20y=0.18x+0.18y$$ $$0.02y=0.08x$$ $$y=4x$$ We also know that $x+y=100$: $$x+4x=100$$ $$5x=100$$ $$x=20$$ Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 25}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("A")  
To solve this problem, we first need to substitute $y=100$ into the given equation. After doing so, we get $0.10x + 20 = 0.18(x + 100)$. Next, we need to simplify this equation by distributing the $0.18$ on the right-hand side, which gives us $0.10x + 20 = 0.18x + 18$. We can then solve for $x$ by subtracting $0.10x$ from both sides and subtracting $18$ from both sides, which gives us $0.08x=2$. Finally, we can solve for $x$ by dividing both sides by $0.08$, which gives us $x=25$. Therefore, Clayton must use $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 5}$ milliliters of the $10 \%$ by mass saline solution.

To solve the problem, we first need to convert 8 hours to minutes.
$8$ hours $= 8 \times 60$ minutes $= 480$ minutes.

To find how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we can multiply the percentage of time spent in meetings by the total number of minutes in her workday. 

$15 \%$ of 480 minutes $= \frac{15}{100} \times 480$ minutes $= 72$ minutes.

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes in meetings.

Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's first find out how many minutes are there in 8 hours:
$$8\ \text{hours} \times 60\ \frac{\text{minutes}}{\text{hour}}=480\ \text{minutes}$$
Now, to find out how many minutes Lani spent in meetings, we can use the fact that she spent $15 \%$ of her workday in meetings. To find out what $15 \%$ of 480 minutes is, we can multiply 480 by 0.15:
$$480\ \text{minutes} \times 0.15=72\ \text{minutes}$$
So, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60. So, Lani's 8-hour workday is equal to $8 \times 60 = 480$ minutes. 

She spent 15% of her workday in meetings. 

To find out how many minutes that is, we can multiply the percentage by the total number of minutes in the workday:

$15\% \times 480 = 0.15 \times 480 = 72$

Therefore, Lani spent 72 minutes of her workday in meetings.

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The best way to approach this problem is to use the formula for the equation of a line: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. We can first find the slope of the line using two points in the form $(p,r)$ from the table. Let's use Clearwater Lane and Glenview Street. The purchase price of Clearwater Lane is $128,000$, which is $128$ in thousands of dollars. The corresponding monthly rental price is $950$. The purchase price of Glenview Street is $140,000$, which is $140$ in thousands of dollars. The corresponding monthly rental price is $1,040$. Using the slope formula, we get: 

\begin{align*}
m &= \frac{\text{change in } r}{\text{change in } p} \\
&= \frac{1,040-950}{140-128} \\
&= \frac{90}{12} \\
&= 7.5
\end{align*}

So the slope of the line is $7.5$. Now we need to find the $y$-intercept, $b$. We can use any point from the table to solve for $b$. Let's use Edgemont Street, which has a purchase price of $70,000$, or $70$ in thousands of dollars, and a monthly rental price of $515$. Plugging in the values we get:

\begin{align*}
r &= mp+b \\
515 &= (7.5)(70)+b \\
b &= -10
\end{align*}

So the equation of the line is $r(p)=7.5p-10$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price, we need to use the two data points given for each property and then use linear regression to find the equation of the line that best fits the data. However, to solve this problem, we can just look at the answer choices and see which one makes sense. 

If we think about the slope of the linear function, it should be the increase in rental price for every increase in purchase price. Looking at the given data, we can see that the rental price generally increases as the purchase price increases. Therefore, the slope should be positive. Looking at the answer choices, we can see that choice B has a positive slope and is the only answer choice with a positive slope. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The slope of the line represents the change in monthly rent for every thousand dollars increase in the purchase price. To find the slope, we can pick two points from the table and use the slope formula: $m=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{r_2-r_1}{p_2-p_1}$. Let's use the first and third properties: $m=\frac{515-950}{70-128}=\frac{-435}{-58}=\frac{435}{58}=7.5.$

This tells us that for every increase of 1000 dollars in the purchase price, the monthly rent increases by 7.5 times. 

We can now use the point-slope formula to find the equation of the line: $r-r_1=m(p-p_1)$. We can pick any of the given points, but let's use the first one: $r-950=7.5(p-128)$. 

Simplifying this equation, we get $r(p)=7.5p-870$. 

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
The slope of the linear function is the amount of change in rent price with respect to the change in purchase price. To find the slope, we need to calculate the change in monthly rent price and divide it by the corresponding change in purchase price. For example, for the first property, the change in monthly rent price is $950-0=950$ dollars, and the change in purchase price is $128-0=128$ thousand dollars. Therefore, the slope for the first property is $950/128=7.421875$. We can perform similar calculations for the other properties to get an average slope of $7.421875+10.3125+7.9375+7.75+7.477941176=41.89931618/5=8.379863236$. This means that the rent price increases by $8379.86$ dollars for every $1000$ dollars increase in purchase price. To convert this into a function with $p$ measured in thousands of dollars, we divide the slope by $1000$ to get $8.379863236/1000=0.008379863236$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is $r(p)=0.008379863236p+b$, where $b$ is the value of $r(p)$ when $p=0$. To find $b$, we can use any of the properties in the table, say the fourth property with a purchase price of $140$ thousand dollars and a monthly rent price of $1040$ dollars. Plugging in these values, we get $1040=0.008379863236\times 140+b$, which gives us $b=1040-0.008379863236\times 140=38.29588234$. Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is $r(p)=0.008379863236p+38.29588234$, which is closest to choice $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ r(p)=2.5 p-870}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
The slope of the line represents the amount of monthly rent per 1000 dollars of purchase price, so we can calculate the slope using two points (128, 950) and (450, 3365). 

Slope $= \frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}=\frac{735}{98} = 7.5$

The y-intercept is the monthly rent when the purchase price is 0, which doesn't make sense in this context. So the equation of the line must be:

$r(p)=7.5 p + \text{(some constant)}$

To find the constant, we can plug in one of the given points and solve for the constant:

$950 = 7.5(128) + \text{(constant)}$

$950 = 960 + \text{(constant)}$

$\text{(constant)} = -10$

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and purchase price is:

$r(p)=7.5 p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
The slope of the linear function can be calculated by finding the change in rental price divided by the change in purchase price. For example, using the data for Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive, the slope is $\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=5$. Therefore, the equation of the line can be written as $r(p)=5p+b$, where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can plug in the values for any of the data pairs, such as $(128,950)$ for Clearwater Lane: $950=5(128)+b$, which gives $b=-610$. Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price and the property's purchase price is $r(p)=5p-610$, which is closest to choice $\textbf{(B)} r(p)=5p+165$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
From the table, we can see that the monthly rental price is approximately equal to 0.0075 times the purchase price (in dollars), plus some constant. So, we can start by writing the equation of the line in slope-intercept form: 

$$r(p) = mp + b$$

where $m$ is the slope (which represents the rate at which the monthly rental price changes with respect to the purchase price) and $b$ is the y-intercept (which represents the constant rental income, regardless of the purchase price). 

To find the slope, we can use any two points from the table. Let's use the first and fourth properties: 

$$(p_1, r_1) = (128, 950) \quad \text{and} \quad (p_2, r_2) = (140, 1040)$$

The change in $r$ is $1040 - 950 = 90$, and the corresponding change in $p$ is $140 - 128 = 12$ (in thousands of dollars). So, the slope is: 

$$m = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p} = \frac{90}{12} = 7.5$$

To find the y-intercept, we can use any point from the table and the slope we just found. Let's use the third property: 

$$(p, r) = (70, 515)$$

Substituting into the slope-intercept form, we have: 

$$515 = 7.5(70) + b$$

Simplifying and solving for $b$, we get: 

$$b = -10$$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is: 

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 7:
The slope of the line is the amount of rental income per $1000 of property value. It can be calculated as the difference in monthly rental price divided by the difference in property prices, as follows: 

slope = (change in rental price) / (change in property price)

slope = ($3365 - 950$) / ($450 - 128$) = $2415/322 = 7.5$

The y-intercept of the line is the monthly rental price when the property price is 0. In this case, it does not make sense to have a property with a price of 0, so the y-intercept has no practical meaning. 

Therefore, the function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is:

$r(p)=7.5p + b$, where $b$ is the y-intercept. 

Answer: Answer(D)
Response 8:
The slope of the linear function represents the increase in monthly rent price for every thousand dollars increase in purchase price. To find the slope, we can choose two points (purchase price, monthly rent) from the table and use the slope formula: $m = \frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}} = \frac{\text{change in y}}{\text{change in x}}$. 

For example, if we choose the points $(128, 950)$ and $(176, 1310)$, the slope would be: 

$$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$ 

This means that for every 1000 dollars increase in purchase price, the monthly rent increases by 7.5 dollars. 

To find the y-intercept (where $p=0$), we can choose any point from the table and substitute the slope we found: 

For example, using the point $(70, 515)$: 

$$r(p) = 7.5p + b$$
$$515 = 7.5(70) + b$$
$$b = -10$$

So the linear function that represents the relationship between monthly rental price and purchase price in thousands of dollars is:

$$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$$

Answer: Answer("D")
Response 9:
The slope of the linear function is the ratio of the change in the monthly rental price to the change in the purchase price. We can choose any two properties to find the slope. Let's use Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive. The change in rental price is $1310-950=360$, and the change in purchase price is $176-128=48$. Thus, the slope is $360/48=7.5$. The $y$-intercept is the monthly rental price when the purchase price is $0$, which does not make sense in this context. Therefore, we do not need to find the $y$-intercept.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: $$\begin{aligned}& b=2.35+0.25 x \\& c=1.75+0.40 x\end{aligned}$$In the equations above, $b$ and $c$ represent the price per pound, in dollars, of beef and chicken, respectively, $x$ weeks after July 1 during last summer. What was the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 2.60$
  B: $\$ 2.85$
  C: $\$ 2.95$
  D: $\$ 3.35$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
First, we equate the two equations to each other: $$\begin{aligned} b&=c \\ 2.35+0.25 x &=1.75+0.40 x \\ 0.15 x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4 \end{aligned} $$Substitute $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound: $$\begin{aligned} b&=2.35+0.25(4) \\ &=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95} \end{aligned} $$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we can set the equations equal to each other and solve for $x$.

$$2.35+0.25x = 1.75 + 0.40x$$

Subtracting $2.35$ and $0.25x$ from both sides, we get:

$$0.15x = 0.60$$

Dividing both sides by $0.15$, we get:

$$x=4$$

Therefore, the prices per pound of beef and chicken were equal 4 weeks after July 1. We can find the price per pound of beef at that time by substituting $x=4$ into the equation for $b$:

$$b = 2.35 + 0.25(4) = 2.35 + 1 = 3.35$$

So the answer is (D) $\$ 3.35$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
We can set up the equation $b=c$ and solve for $x$. We get: 
$$\begin{aligned} 2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.40x \\ 0.10x &= 0.6 \\ x &= 6 \end{aligned}$$
Now that we know $x=6$, we can substitute it back into either equation to find the price per pound of beef. Using $b=2.35+0.25x$, we get:
$$b=2.35+0.25(6)=\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \$2.60}$$
Response 5:
We are given that $b=c$. Substituting the given expressions, we obtain $2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$. Solving for $x$, we find that $x=6$. Substituting this value of $x$ into either equation gives us the price per pound of beef when it is equal to the price per pound of chicken. Substituting into the equation $b=2.35+0.25x$, we obtain $b=2.35+0.25(6)=\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$2.95}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
We want to find the value of $x$ that satisfies $b=c$, then plug that value into either equation to find the price per pound. 

We start by setting $b=c$ and solve for $x$:
$$\begin{aligned} b &= c \\ 2.35+0.25x &= 1.75+0.40x \\ 0.15x &= 0.60 \\ x &= 4\end{aligned}$$

So the price per pound of beef was equal to the price per pound of chicken $4$ weeks after July 1. We can now plug $x=4$ into either equation to find the price per pound:
$$\begin{aligned} b &= 2.35+0.25(4) \\ &= 2.35+1 \\ &= 3.35\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) } \$3.35}$.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let's represent the event of a tablet user answering "always" by $A$ and the event of a tablet user not answering "never" by $B$. Then we want to find $P(A|B)$. Using conditional probability, we have: $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$$We can find $P(A \cap B)$ by looking at the table. Of the total sample, $30.9 \%$ answered "Always" and $31.3 \%$ answered "Never," so the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is $30.9-31.3=-0.4 \%$. However, this doesn't make sense as a probability, so we can assume that $0 \%$ of tablet users answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never." Therefore, we have $P(A \cap B)=0 \%$.

We can find $P(B)$ as follows: \begin{align*}
P(B)&=1-P(\text{Never}) \\
&=1-31.3 \% \\
&=68.7 \% \\
&=0.687.
\end{align*}Therefore, we have: $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}=\frac{0 \%}{0.687}=0.$$Thus, the closest choice to $0$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.31}$.
Response 1:
Let the event $A$ be that a tablet user answers "Always" and let the event $B$ be that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

We can use Bayes' Theorem: $$P(A|B)=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}.$$ First, we need to find $P(B|A),$ the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never" given that the tablet user answered "Always." Since $30.9 \%$ of tablet users answered "Always," $69.1 \%$ did not answer "Always." Since $31.3 \%$ of tablet users answered "Never," all of those users did not answer "Always," so we have \begin{align*}
P(B|A)&=\frac{\text{tablet users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never"}}{\text{tablet users who answered "Always"}}\\
&=\frac{100 \% - 31.3 \%}{30.9 \%} \approx 2.39.
\end{align*} Next, we need to find $P(A),$ the probability that a tablet user answers "Always." According to the table, $30.9 \%$ of tablet users answered "Always." Finally, we need to find $P(B),$ the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Since $31.3 \%$ of tablet users answered "Never," $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$ of tablet users did not answer "Never."

Putting everything together, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B)&=\frac{P(B|A)\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\\
&=\frac{2.39 \cdot 0.309}{0.687}\\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) } 0.45}.
\end{align*}
Response 2:
As the question asks for the probability that a tablet user who did not answer "Never" answered "Always", we need to consider only the tablet users who did not answer "Never". The percentage of tablet users who did not answer "Never" is $100 \% - 31.3 \% = 68.7 \%$. Among these tablet users, the percentage who answered "Always" is $30.9 \%$. Therefore, the probability that a tablet user who did not answer "Never" answered "Always" is $\frac{30.9 \%}{68.7 \%} \approx 0.45$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$.
Response 3:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then, we want to find $P(A|B).$ Using Bayes' Theorem, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B|A^c)P(A^c) + P(B|A)P(A)} \\
&= \frac{(0.309)(0.309)}{(0.243)(0.687) + (0.309)(0.313)} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}.
\end{align*}
Response 4:
Let's call the event of a tablet user answering "Always" as event A, and the event of a tablet user not answering "Never" as event B. We want to find the conditional probability of A given B. We can use the conditional probability formula: 

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B)

From the table, we can see that the percent of users who answered "Never" is 31.3%. So the percent of users who did not answer "Never" is 100% - 31.3% = 68.7%. This is the probability of event B occurring (i.e. a tablet user not answering "Never"). 

To find the probability of A and B occurring, we look at the table again and see that the percent of users who answered "Always" and did not answer "Never" is 30.9%. So:

P(A and B) = 30.9%

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

P(A|B) = P(A and B) / P(B) = 30.9% / 68.7% = 0.449 or approximately 0.45

Therefore the answer is (C) 0.45.
Response 5:
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never" is equal to the probability that they answered "Always" AND did not answer "Never" divided by the probability that they did not answer "Never". 

The probability that they answered "Always" AND did not answer "Never" is $30.9 \% - 31.3 \% = - 0.4 \%$. However, this is not a valid probability since it is negative. This means that none of the people who answered this survey did not answer "Never" AND answered "Always". Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Let's first calculate the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never": $1-0.313=0.687$.

Then, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always" given that they did not answer "Never" is:

$\frac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.449 \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}$
Response 7:
Let $P(A)$ denote the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," and let $P(B)$ denote the probability that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then,\[P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{0.309}{1-0.313} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\; 0.38}\]
Response 8:
Let's first consider the total percentage of tablet users who did not answer "Never." This is $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%.$

Out of this group, the percentage who answered "Always" is $30.9\%.$

Therefore, the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never," is:

$$\frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx 0.450$$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let event A be the tablet user answered "Always" and event B be the tablet user did not answer "Never".
Then, $P(A|B) = \dfrac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
$P(B) = 1 - 0.313 = 0.687$
$P(A \cap B) = 0.309$
$P(A|B) = \dfrac{0.309}{0.687} \approx 0.45$
Therefore, the answer is (C) 0.45.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal and $y$ cups of Super Grain cereal.
The total number of calories in the mixture is obtained by adding the number of calories from each type of cereal. 
From the problem, we know that the number of calories in $3/4$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is 210, so the number of calories in a cup of Crunchy Grain is
$$(210\text{ calories})\cdot \frac{4}{3}=280\text{ calories}.$$ 
Thus, the number of calories in $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal is $280x$.
Similarly, the number of calories in $y$ cups of Super Grain cereal is $240y$.
Since the total number of calories in the mixture is 270, we have the equation $280x+240y=270$. 
We want to solve for $y$, so we can rearrange the equation as follows:
\begin{align*}
280x+240y&=270\\
240y&=270-280x\\
y&=\frac{270-280x}{240}\\
y&=\frac{27-28x}{24}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $y=\frac{27-28x}{24}$.
We still need to find the value of $x$ from the given information. Since Jennifer uses $3/4$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal, we have
$$x+\frac{3}{4}=1,$$
which implies $x=1-\frac{3}{4}=\frac{1}{4}$.
Finally, we can substitute $x=\frac{1}{4}$ into the expression for $y$ to get
$$y=\frac{27-7}{24}=\frac{1}{3}.$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{3}\text{ cup}}$.
Response 1:
Let's use $x$ to represent the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, which is a combination of Crunchy Grain cereal and Super Grain cereal. 

From the nutrition facts, we know that $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories. 

We don't know the total volume of the mixture, but we can set up a proportion to relate the amount of Super Grain cereal to the total volume. We know that 1 cup is equal to 4 servings of Crunchy Grain cereal, so:

$\frac{\text{amount of Super Grain cereal}}{\text{total volume}} = \frac{\text{calories from Super Grain cereal}}{\text{total calories}}$

$\frac{x}{4 + \text{amount of Super Grain cereal}} = \frac{240x}{270}$

To solve for $x$, we can cross-multiply and simplify:

$270x = 960x + 960$

$690x = 960$

$x \approx 1.39$

So Jennifer needs approximately 1.39 cups of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. 

To check the answer choices, we can convert 1.39 cups to other units:

$\frac{1.39}{4} \approx 0.35 \text{ cups}$

$0.35 \text{ cups} \approx \frac{1}{3} \text{ cup}$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$.
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal Jennifer mixes with $y$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Since the total volume is one cup, we have $x+y=1$. We can set up the equation for the total number of calories:
\begin{align*}
240x+210\left(\frac{3}{4}y\right)&=270\\
240x+157.5y&=270\\
8x+5y&=18\\
8x+5(1-x)&=18\\
3x&=7\\
x&=\frac{7}{3}.
\end{align*}
Since $x$ represents the amount of Super Grain cereal and we want to find the amount in $\operatorname{cup}$s, we need to multiply $x$ by $\frac{1}{240}$ to get the amount in $\operatorname{cup}$s. Thus, Jennifer mixes $\frac{7}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{240} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}$ of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{2}{3}$ $\operatorname{cup}$ of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Response 3:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal and $(1-x)$ cups of Super Grain cereal in her mixture.
The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is:
\begin{align*}
\text{total calories} &= \text{calories from Crunchy Grain} + \text{calories from Super Grain} \\
&= 210x + 240(1-x) \\
&= 240 - 30x
\end{align*}
According to the problem, this equals 270. Solving the equation $240 - 30x = 270$ gives $x = \frac{1}{3}$.
So Jennifer is using $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal and $\frac{2}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in her mixture.
The question asks for the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, so we only need to consider one cup. Since the ratio of Crunchy Grain to Super Grain is $\frac{1}{3}$ to $\frac{2}{3}$, then the amount of Super Grain in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{2}{3}$ of a cup. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Let's assume Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
The number of calories provided by Super Grain cereal is $240x$ and the number of calories provided by Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} \times \left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=280-280x$.
The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $240x+280-280x=280-40x$.
We are given that this is equal to 270, so we can solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
280-40x &= 270 \\
-40x &= -10 \\
x &= \frac{1}{4}
\end{align*}
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Let's assume that Jennifer adds $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal.
Then, the amount of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal would be $210\cdot\frac{4}{3}x$.
Since the total calories in the mixture is 270, the amount of calories from Super Grain cereal would be $270 - 210\cdot\frac{4}{3}x$.
We also know that Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. So we can set up the following equation:
$$240x = 270 - 210\cdot\frac{4}{3}x$$
Solving for $x$, we get:
$$x = \frac{1}{3}$$
So Jennifer added $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal to the mixture.
Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's say that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. The number of calories from Crunchy Grain cereal will be $\frac{210}{3/4}=280$. The number of calories from Super Grain cereal will be $240x$. The total number of calories in the mixture will be $280+240x$. We are told that this equals 270 calories. Thus, we have the equation: $$280+240x=270.$$ Solving for $x$, we get $x=\frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Let x be the amount of Super Grain cereal in cups. 

We know that the number of calories provided by Crunchy Grain is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}} = 280$ calories per cup of cereal. 

The total number of calories in a cup of the mixture is the sum of the number of calories from Super Grain and Crunchy Grain. So we have the equation:

$240x + 280(1 - x) = 270$

Simplifying and solving for x, we get:

$x = \frac{1}{4}$

Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal for a total of 1 cup of cereal mixture.

Answer: Answer("B") $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 8:
Let x be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. Then the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $1-x.$ 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is the sum of the calories from the two cereals: 

$240x+210(1-x)=270.$ 

Solving this equation gives $x=\frac{1}{3}.$ 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}}.$
Response 9:
Let's denote the amount of Super Grain cereal Jennifer uses by $x$ cups. 
The total number of calories from the Super Grain cereal is $240x$, and the total number of calories from the Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{210}{\frac{3}{4}}\cdot (1-x)=280(1-x)$. 
Thus, we can write the equation:
$$240x+280(1-x)=270$$
Simplifying the equation, we get:
$$240x+280-280x=270$$
$$-40x=-10$$
$$x=\frac{1}{4}$$
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{2}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal to get a cup of the mixture.

Question: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of which of the following equations is perpendicular to the graph of the equation above?
Choices:
  A: $3 x+2 y=6$
  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
To find an equation perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation and then take the negative reciprocal of it to get the slope of a line perpendicular to it.

Action: Answer("C")  

The given equation can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$, so the slope of a line perpendicular to it is $-\frac{3}{2}$. The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be written in slope-intercept form as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, which has a slope of $-\frac{1}{2}$. Since $-\frac{1}{2}$ is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, the graph of this equation is perpendicular to the graph of $-2x+3y=6$.
Response 1:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$, we need to find the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. 

The equation $-2x+3y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=(2/3)x+2$. The slope of this equation is $(2/3)$. The negative reciprocal of $(2/3)$ is $-3/2$. 

So, the slope of the equation we are looking for must be $-3/2$.

Let's check which equation has a slope of $-3/2$.

A: $3x+2y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=(-3/2)x+3$. The slope is $-3/2$, so this equation is perpendicular to the given equation. 

B: $3x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=(-3/4)x+3/2$. The slope is $-3/4$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

C: $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=(-1/2)x+3/2$. The slope is $-1/2$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

D: $2x+6y=3$ can be rewritten as $y=(-1/3)x+1/2$. The slope is $-1/3$, so this equation is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

Therefore, the equation that is perpendicular to $-2x+3y=6$ is $3x+2y=6$ or choice A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
We can find the slope of the given equation by putting it in slope-intercept form: $$-2x+3y=6 \Rightarrow y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$ The slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

The equation of a line perpendicular to it will have a slope of the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Now we need to check which equation has a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$: 

A: $3x+2y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so this is the correct answer. 

B, C, and D do not have a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}$, so they are not perpendicular to the given equation. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
To identify the equation that is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation. The slope-intercept form of a line is $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. To convert the given equation to slope-intercept form, we solve for $y$:

\begin{align*}
-2x+3y&=6 \\
3y&=2x+6\\
y&=\frac{2}{3}x+2
\end{align*}

Therefore, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$. Therefore, we need to find the equation whose slope is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$:

$$-\frac{2}{3} \cdot m=-1$$
$$m=\frac{3}{2}$$

The only equation whose slope is $\frac{3}{2}$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 2x+6y=3}$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
To find which equation is perpendicular to $-2x + 3y = 6$, we need to determine the slope of the given equation. The slope of the given equation is $2/3$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this line is the negative reciprocal of this slope which is $-3/2$. Thus, the equation with slope $-3/2$ is the equation that is perpendicular to $-2x + 3y = 6$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve this problem, we need to find the slope of the given equation. We can rearrange the equation to the slope-intercept form $y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$. Therefore, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

For two lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must be negative reciprocals of each other. The negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$ is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

We can rewrite each equation in slope-intercept form, and then find their slopes. The equation whose slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$ will be perpendicular to the given equation.

A: $3 x+2 y=6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{3}{2}x + 3$, so this is not perpendicular to the given equation.
B: $3 x+4 y=6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{3}{4}x + \frac{3}{4}$, so this is not perpendicular to the given equation.
C: $2 x+4 y=6$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}$, so this is not perpendicular to the given equation.
D: $2 x+6 y=3$ can be rearranged to $y = -\frac{1}{3}x + \frac{1}{2}$, so this is perpendicular to the given equation.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To find the equation that is perpendicular, we need to compare the slopes of the given equations with the slope of the given equation ($-2x+3y=6$). The slope of the given equation is $2/3$. To be perpendicular, the slope of the equation should be negative reciprocal of $2/3$ which is $-3/2$. 

Action: Answer("C") 

The slope of the equation $2x+4y=6$ is $-1/2$, which is the negative reciprocal of $2/3$.
Response 7:
To determine which equation is perpendicular to the given equation, we can compare the slopes of the lines. The given equation can be rewritten in slope-intercept form as $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$, so the slope of its graph is $\frac{2}{3}$. A line that is perpendicular to it must have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$, which is $-\frac{3}{2}$. 

Action: Answer("C")  
The equation $2x+4y=6$ can be rewritten as $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$, so its slope is $-\frac{1}{2}$, which is the negative reciprocal of $\frac{2}{3}$. Therefore, the graph of this equation is perpendicular to the graph of the given equation.
Response 8:
To find which equation is perpendicular to $-2 x+3 y=6$, we need to find the slope of $-2 x+3 y=6$ and then find the equation with slope that is the negative reciprocal of that slope. 

The slope of $-2 x+3 y=6$ can be found by putting it in slope-intercept form: $3y=2x+6$, $y=(2/3)x+2$. Therefore, the slope of the line is $2/3$.

The negative reciprocal of $2/3$ is $-3/2$.

Action: Answer("C")  
The equation $2x+4y=6$ has a slope of $-1.5$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of $-2x+3y=6$, making it perpendicular.

Question: A company that makes wildlife videos purchases camera equipment for $\$ 32,400$. The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, after which it is considered to have no monetary value. How much is the camera equipment worth 4 years after it is purchased?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 10,800$
  B: $\$ 16,200$
  C: $\$ 21,600$
  D: $\$ 29,700$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Solution: 

The equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, so its value decreases evenly each year. The total decrease in value is:

$12 \text{ years} \times \frac{\$ 32,400}{12\text{ years}}=\$ 32,400$

This means that the company is left with $\$0$ of equipment value after 12 years. 

Therefore, the amount of value lost per year is $\frac{\$32,400}{12\text{ years}}=\$2,700$.

Four years passed since the purchase, so the equipment's current value is: 

$\$ 32,400 - 4 \text{ years} \times \$2,700/\text{year}=\$ 21,600$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$21,600}$
Response 2:
To solve the problem, we can use straight-line depreciation, which means that the equipment depreciates by the same amount each year. The depreciation per year is the total depreciation (initial value minus salvage value) divided by the number of years of useful life. In this case, the initial value of the equipment is $\$ 32,400$, the salvage value is $\$ 0$, and the useful life is 12 years. Therefore, the yearly depreciation is:

$\frac{\$ 32,400 - \$ 0}{12 \text{ years}} = \$ 2,700 \text{ per year}$

After 4 years, the equipment has depreciated by $4 \times \$ 2,700 = \$ 10,800$. Therefore, the equipment is worth:

$\$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \$ 21,600}$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
First, we need to find the annual depreciation rate:
$\text{Depreciation per year} = \frac{\text{Initial cost}}{\text{Useful life in years}} = \frac{\$32,400}{12} = \$2,700$
After 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by $4 \cdot \$2,700 = \$10,800.$ Therefore, its worth will be $\$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600.$

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we need to find the annual depreciation rate of the camera equipment in order to subtract that from the initial value to find the value after 4 years. Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate for 12 years, we can find the annual depreciation rate by dividing the initial value by 12. 

$32400/12=2700$

This means that the equipment depreciates by $\$2,700$ per year. After 4 years, the equipment would have depreciated by 4 times this amount:

$4 \times 2700 = 10800$

Subtracting this from the initial value gives us the value after 4 years:

$32400 - 10800 = 21600$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\$21,600}$.
Response 6:
Let's use straight-line depreciation to solve this problem, which means that the equipment depreciates by the same amount every year. 

The initial value of the equipment is $\$32,400$ and it depreciates for 12 years, so the yearly depreciation is:

$$\frac{\$32,400}{12 \text{ years}} = \$2,700\text{/year}$$

After 4 years, the equipment will have depreciated by:

$$4 \text{ years} \cdot \$2,700\text{/year} = \$10,800$$

So, the current value of the equipment is:

$$ \$32,400 - \$10,800 = \$21,600$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$21,600$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To determine the answer, we can first figure out the rate at which the equipment depreciates each year. Since the equipment depreciates in value at a constant rate over 12 years, its value after 12 years will be 0. This means that each year its value decreases by the same amount. Let's call this yearly depreciation rate "d."

We can set up the following equation to represent the decrease in value over the 12-year period:

$32,400 - 12d = 0$

Solving for "d," we get:

$d = 2,700$

This means that the equipment decreases in value by $\$2,700$ each year. So after 4 years, the equipment's value will be:

$32,400 - 4d = 32,400 - 4(2,700) = 32,400 - 10,800 = \boxed{\$21,600}$

Therefore, the solution is (C) $\$21,600$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Depreciation is the loss in value of an asset over time. Since the equipment depreciates at a constant rate, it will lose the same amount of value every year. If $V$ is the value of the equipment at any given time (measured in years after purchase), then we know that after 12 years, $V=0$. This means that the equipment loses $\frac{\$ 32,400}{12 \text{ years}}=\$ 2,700$ in value per year. 

After 4 years, the equipment will have lost a total of $4 \text{ years} \times \$ 2,700/\text{year} = \$ 10,800$ in value. 

Thus, the value of the equipment after 4 years is $V = \$ 32,400 - \$ 10,800 = \$ 21,600$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A cylindrical can containing pieces of fruit is filled to the top with syrup before being sealed. The base of the can has an area of $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, and the height of the can is $10 \mathrm{~cm}$. If $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of syrup is needed to fill the can to the top, which of the following is closest to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can?
Choices:
  A: $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  B: $185 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  C: $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
  D: $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 0:
We can begin by using the formula for volume of a cylinder: $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. We want to find the volume of the fruit, so we need to first find the volume of the syrup, which is given as $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

The volume of the syrup is equal to the volume of the cylinder, which is:

$110 = \pi r^2 h$

We are given the height $h = 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ and the area of the base $75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, which gives us:

$75 = \pi r^2$

Solving for $r$, we get:

$r^2 = \frac{75}{\pi}$

$r \approx 4.34 \mathrm{~cm}$ (rounded to two decimal places)

Now that we have the radius, we can find the volume of the fruit. The total volume of the cylinder is:

$V_{\text{cyl}} = \pi r^2 h \approx 1367.86 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

And the volume of the fruit is:

$V_{\text{fruit}} = V_{\text{cyl}} - V_{\text{syrup}} \approx 1257.86 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

The closest answer choice is D, $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let the volume of the cylinder be V. Then we know:

V = A x h = 75 x 10 = 750 cm^3

Let the volume of the fruit be F. Then we know:

V + F = total volume

We also know that the volume of syrup is equal to the volume of fruit. Then:

V + V = 2V = 750 + 110 = 860 cm^3

F = total volume - V = 860 - 750 = 110 cm^3

Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Let's start by finding the radius of the can. 

We know that
$$
V_{\text{syrup}} = Ah,
$$
where $V_{\text{syrup}}$ is the volume of the syrup, $A$ is the area of the base of the can, and $h$ is the height of the can. 

Plugging in the given values, we get
$$
110 = 75 \cdot 10,
$$
and solving for $A$, we get
$$
A = \frac{110}{10\cdot 75} = \frac{22}{15}\pi\approx 4.62.
$$

So the radius of the base of the can is $\sqrt{\frac{A}{\pi}}\approx 1.08$.

Now, let's find the volume of the fruit. The total volume of the can is $Ah$, and we know that $110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ of that is syrup. So the volume of the fruit is
$$
V_{\text{fruit}} = Ah - 110 = 75 \cdot 10 - 110 = 640,
$$
which is closest to choice C, $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$.

Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
We can start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the given values:
$V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h = \pi (\sqrt{75/\pi})^2 (10) \approx 750\mathrm{~cm}^3$
Then we can subtract the volume of syrup from the total volume to get an approximate volume for the fruit pieces:
$V_{\text{fruit}} \approx 750\mathrm{~cm}^3 - 110\mathrm{~cm}^3 = 640\mathrm{~cm}^3$
Therefore, the answer is (C) $640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can start the problem by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, $V = \pi r^{2}h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. We can then subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume to get the volume of the fruit. The radius can be found by dividing the area of the base by $\pi$ and taking the square root. 

Working out the calculations, we get:

$ r = \sqrt{\frac{75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}}{\pi}} \approx 4.33 \mathrm{~cm}$

$V_{\mathrm{can}} = \pi r^{2}h = \pi (4.33 \mathrm{~cm})^{2} (10 \mathrm{~cm}) \approx 591.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

$V_{\mathrm{fruit}} = V_{\mathrm{can}} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} \approx 481.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is:

Action: Answer("D")  $750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$
Response 5:
We can start by finding the volume of the can using the given formula for the volume of a cylinder: $V=\pi r^{2}h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height. Since the area of the base is given by $75\text{ cm}^2$, we have $\pi r^{2}=75$. Solving for $r$, we get $r=\sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}}\approx5.40 \text{ cm}$. Hence, the volume of the can is $V_{\text{can}}=\pi r^{2}h\approx 1710.1 \text{ cm}^{3}$. 

Subtracting the volume of the syrup, we get the volume of the fruit: $V_{\text{fruit}}=V_{\text{can}}-110\text{ cm}^{3} \approx 1600.1 \text{ cm}^{3}$. 

However, we need to double-check that our answer is reasonable. The volume of the fruit should be less than the volume of the can, and it should also be less than the volume of a cylinder that perfectly fits inside the can (i.e. has the same height and base radius as the can). The volume of this smaller cylinder would be $V_{\text{cyl}}=\pi r^{2}h\approx 1028.8 \text{ cm}^{3}$. Therefore, we have $V_{\text{fruit}}<V_{\text{can}}$ and $V_{\text{fruit}}<V_{\text{cyl}}$. The answer closest to $1600.1$ that satisfies these inequalities is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}}$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let's start by calculating the volume of the cylinder. 

$V = Bh = (75~\mathrm{cm}^2)(10~\mathrm{cm}) = 750~\mathrm{cm}^3$

We know that $110~\mathrm{cm}^3$ of this volume is syrup, so the remaining volume must be filled with the fruit. 

$750~\mathrm{cm}^3 - 110~\mathrm{cm}^3 = 640~\mathrm{cm}^3$

Therefore, the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is 640 cubic centimeters. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Let's start by finding the volume of the cylinder using the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, where $r$ is the radius of the base and $h$ is the height of the cylinder. Since the base has an area of $75\text{ cm}^2$, the radius is given by $r = \sqrt{\frac{75}{\pi}} \approx 4.33\text{ cm}$. Therefore, the volume of the cylinder is $V_{\text{cyl}} = \pi r^2 h \approx 546.48\text{ cm}^3$.

We also know that $110\text{ cm}^3$ of syrup is required to completely fill the can to the top. This volume of syrup will occupy the space between the fruit pieces, so the total volume of the pieces of fruit will be $V_{\text{pieces}} = V_{\text{cyl}} - 110\text{ cm}^3 \approx 436.48\text{ cm}^3$.

Therefore, the closest answer choice to the total volume of the pieces of fruit in the can is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 640\text{ cm}^3}$.
Response 9:
Let's start with finding the volume of the cylinder. We can use the formula $V = Bh$ where $B$ is the area of the base and $h$ is the height.
$$V = Bh = 75 \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm} = 750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$
This is the volume of both the syrup and the fruit combined. To find the volume of only the fruit, we can subtract the volume of the syrup from the total volume of the can:
$$750 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} - 110 \mathrm{~cm}^{3} = 640 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: If $y=k x$, where $k$ is a constant, and $y=24$ when $x=6$, what is the value of $y$ when $x=5$ ?
Choices:
  A: 6
  B: 15
  C: 20
  D: 23
Response 0:
We can begin by solving for the constant $k$ using the information given:
$$ y = k x $$
$$ 24 = k \cdot 6 $$
$$ k = 4 $$

Now that we know the value of $k$, we can use it to find $y$ when $x=5$:
$$ y = k x $$
$$ y = 4 \cdot 5 $$
$$ y = 20 $$

Therefore, the answer is **Choice C: 20**.
Response 1:
First we need to find the value of constant k. We know that y = kx and y = 24 when x = 6. So, 

k = y / x = 24 / 6 = 4

Now we can use this value of k to find y when x = 5. 

y = kx = 4 x 5 = 20

Therefore, the answer is:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
We can use the given information to solve for the constant $k$: 

$y=kx \Rightarrow 24=k(6) \Rightarrow k=4$

Now we can use $y=kx$ with $k=4$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$:

$y=4(5)=20$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("20")
Response 4:
Given that $y = kx$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$. We can solve for $k$ by dividing y by x, i.e. $k = \frac{y}{x}=\frac{24}{6}=4$. 

Therefore, $y = kx = 4x$

We need to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$.

Substituting the value of $x=5$ in the above equation, we get $y=4 \times 5 = 20$

Hence, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Firstly, we can find the value of the constant $k$. If $y=kx$ and $y=24$ when $x=6$, then $24=k(6)$. Solving for $k$, we get $k=4$. 

Next, if $y=kx$ and $k=4$, then $y=4(5)=20$ when $x=5$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
To solve this problem, we need to find the value of k first by using the given equation, y=kx. When x=6 and y=24, we have $24=k(6)$. Solving for k, we get $k=4$. Now we can use k to find the value of y when x=5: $y=kx=4\times 5=\boxed{\textbf{(B) } 15}$. 

Therefore, the answer is B.
Response 7:
To solve this question, we can first find the value of $k$ using the given information. If $y=kx$, we know that $k=y/x$. Given that $y=24$ when $x=6$, we have $k=24/6=4$. 

Once we know the value of $k$, we can use the formula $y=kx$ to find the value of $y$ when $x=5$. Thus:

$$y=kx=(4)(5)=20$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
First, we can solve for the constant $k$: 

$k=\frac{y}{x}$

Plugging in the given values: 

$k=\frac{24}{6}=4$

So the equation is $y=4x$. 

To answer the question, we just plug in $x=5$:

$y=4(5)=20$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
First we need to find the constant k. From "y=kx" and "y=24 when x=6" we know that 24 = k * 6. So k = 24/6 = 4.

Then, we can use "y=kx" and substitute k = 4 and x = 5 to get y = 4 * 5 = 20.

We can use the given equations to solve for $w$ and $t$ and then find the value of $2w + 3t$.
Multiplying the first equation by $-2$ gives $-4w - 8t = -28$.
Adding this to the second equation gives $0w - 3t = -3$, so $t=1$.
Substituting $t=1$ in the first given equation gives $2w+4=14$, so $w=5$.
Therefore, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=10+3=13$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }13}$.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can solve for $w$ and $t$ by multiplying the first equation by $-2$ and adding it to the second equation to eliminate $w$:
\begin{align*}
-2(2w+4t) + 4w+5t &= -28+25\\
-t &= -3\\
t &= 3
\end{align*}
Then we can substitute $t=3$ back into the first equation to get:
\begin{align*}
2w+4(3) &= 14\\
w &= 1
\end{align*}
Finally, we can plug $w=1$ and $t=3$ into $2w+3t$ to get:
\begin{align*}
2(1)+3(3) &= 9+2\\
&= 11
\end{align*}
Therefore the answer is $2w+3t=11$, which is choice C.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")  

Solution:
We can multiply the first equation by $-2$ to obtain $-4w-8t=-28$. Next, we can add this equation to the second given equation to obtain:
$$ (-4w - 8t) + (4w + 5t) = -3t = -3 $$
Hence, $t=1$. Plugging this value into the first given equation gives $2w+4=14$, so $w=5$. Therefore, $2w+3t=2(5)+3(1)=10+3=\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 13}$.

To solve this problem, we can start by simplifying $4z + 8y$:

$4z + 8y = 4(a^2 + b^2) + 8ab = 4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2$

We can then factor out a 4 from the first two terms:

$4a^2 + 8ab + 4b^2 = 4(a^2 + 2ab + b^2)$

Using the identity $a^2 + 2ab + b^2 = (a+b)^2$, we get:

$4(a^2 + 2ab + b^2) = 4(a+b)^2$

Question: Shipping Charges\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$\begin{array}{c}\text { Merchandise weight } \\ \text { (pounds) }\end{array}$ & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Shipping } \\ \text { charge }\end{array}$ \\\hline5 & $\$ 16.94$ \\\hline10 & $\$ 21.89$ \\\hline20 & $\$ 31.79$ \\\hline40 & $\$ 51.59$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows shipping charges for an online retailer that sells sporting goods. There is a linear relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise. Which function can be used to determine the total shipping charge $f(x)$, in dollars, for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds?
Choices:
  A: $f(x)=0.99 x$
  B: $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$
  C: $f(x)=3.39 x$
  D: $f(x)=3.39 x+16.94$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
The given information tells that the relationship between the shipping charge and the weight of the merchandise is linear, which can be represented in the slope-intercept form: $y=mx+b$, where $y$ is the shipping charge, $x$ is the weight of the merchandise, $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. From the table, we can find the slope as the ratio of the change in shipping charge to the change in weight, which gives $m=\frac{\$ (21.89 - 16.94)}{10-5}=\$ 0.99$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can plug in one of the given coordinates (5, 16.94) into the slope-intercept form and solve for $b$. This gives $16.94=0.99(5)+b$, from which we get $b=11.99$. Therefore, the function that determines the total shipping charge for an order with a merchandise weight of $x$ pounds is $f(x)=0.99 x+11.99$.  

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
The function is linear and corresponds to the equation of a line = $y = mx + b$, where $m$ is the slope of the line, and $b$ is the y-intercept. Therefore, we can use 2 points from the table to compute the slope (m). For example, we can use (5,16.94) and (10,21.89) as follows: 

$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{21.89-16.94}{10-5} = \frac{4.95}{5} = 0.99$

The y-intercept (b) is the shipping charge when x=0, which is equal to the first shipping charge. Hence, $b=16.94$

Therefore, the function is : $f(x)=0.99 x+16.94$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
The given table shows a linear relationship between shipping charge and merchandise weight. Therefore, we can write the equation of the form $f(x)=mx+b$ where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept of the line. Using the values from the given table, we can calculate the slope of the line as follows: 

Slope $m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$, where $(x_1,y_1)=(5,16.94)$ and $(x_2, y_2)=(40,51.59)$

$m=\dfrac{51.59-16.94}{40-5}=\dfrac{34.65}{35}\approx0.99$

Therefore, the slope of the line is approximately $0.99$. Now, we can calculate the y-intercept as follows:

$y=mx+b\Longrightarrow b=y-mx=16.94-0.99\cdot 5\approx 11.99$

Therefore, the y-intercept of the line is approximately $11.99$. Thus, the equation of the line is $f(x)=0.99x+11.99$.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
To determine the function that relates the weight and shipping charge, we need to find the equation of the line that connects the points $(5, 16.94)$ and $(40, 51.59)$. We can use the slope-intercept form of a linear equation: $y=mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the $y$-intercept. 

The slope is equal to the change in $y$ divided by the change in $x$, or:

$$m=\frac{51.59-16.94}{40-5}=\frac{34.65}{35}=0.99$$

The $y$-intercept is the value of $y$ when $x=0$, which we don't have in the table. But we can use the slope and one of the points to find $b$. Using the point $(5, 16.94)$:

$$16.94=0.99(5)+b$$

Simplifying:

$$b=16.94-4.95=11.99$$

So the equation of the line is:

$$y=0.99x+11.99$$

which means:

$$f(x)=0.99x+11.99$$

Response 4:
To check whether there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$, we need to check whether $\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}$ is always constant.  
We have $$\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$$
Let's check:
$$\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\frac{-2a-(-a)}{5a-3a}=-\frac{a}{2a}=-\frac{1}{2}$$
We got a constant value which means there is a linear relationship between $x$ and $y$.  

Now we need to find the equation that satisfies the linear relationship, $y=mx+b$.  
We determined that the slope $m=-\frac{1}{2}$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can plug in the values of a point, for example, $(a,0)$.  
$$0=-\frac{1}{2}(a)+b$$
$$b=\frac{1}{2}(a)$$
Therefore the equation is $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$.  

Finally, we need to manipulate this equation to match one of the given choices.  
$$y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}a$$

Question: $$\begin{aligned}1 \text { decagram } & =10 \text { grams } \\1,000 \text { milligrams } & =1 \text { gram }\end{aligned}$$A hospital stores one type of medicine in 2-decagram containers. Based on the information given in the box above, how many 1-milligram doses are there in one 2-decagram container?
Choices:
  A: $\quad 0.002$
  B: $\quad 200$
  C: $\quad 2,000$
  D: 20,000
Response 0:
There are 10 grams in 1 decagram. Since there are 1,000 milligrams in 1 gram, then there are $$(10\quad \text{g})\times \left(1000\frac{\text{mg}}{\text{g}}\right) = 10,000 \text{ mg}$$ in 1 decagram. Therefore, there are $$(2 \quad \text{dag})\times (10,000\quad \text{mg/dag})=20,000\quad \text{mg}$$ in one 2-decagram container. 

Dividing 20,000 mg by 1 mg per dose gives the number of 1-milligram doses, which is 20,000.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to convert from decagrams to milligrams, using the given conversions. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
One decagram is equal to 10 grams. Therefore, two decagrams is equal to 20 grams.
Thus, there are $20 \text{ grams} \cdot \frac{1000 \text{ mg}}{1\text{ gram}}=20,000 \text{ mg}$ in a 2-decagram container.
Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $20,000$ doses in a 2-decagram container.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
The weight of 2 decagrams is $2 \times 10 = 20$ grams. Since 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 20 grams is equal to 20,000 milligrams. Therefore, there are 20,000 one-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
2 decagrams = $2 \times 10$ grams = $20$ grams

Since $1$ gram = $1{,}000$ milligrams, 20 grams = 20,000 milligrams.

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
To start solving this problem, we need to convert 2 decagrams to milligrams. 

$1~\text{decagram}=10~\text{grams}=10,000~\text{milligrams}$

So, 2 decagrams is equal to $20,000~\text{milligrams}$. 

Now, since we want to find out how many 1-milligram doses are there in 2-decagram (20,000 milligrams) container, we divide:

$20,000~\text{milligrams}/1~\text{milligram}=20,\!000$

This means there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(D) } 20,000$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Since 1 decagram is equal to 10 grams and 1,000 milligrams is equal to 1 gram, then 1 decagram is equal to 10000 milligrams.

Therefore, there are 20,000 1-milligram doses in one 2-decagram container.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
We first need to find out how many grams are in a 2-decagram container: $$2\text{ dag} = 2\times 10\text{ g/dag} = 20\text{ g}.$$Then we convert grams to milligrams: $$20\text{ g} \times \frac{1000\text{ mg}}{1\text{ g}}= 20,000\text{ mg}.$$Since each dose is 1 milligram, there are $20,000$ doses in one 2-decagram container.

So, the total text messages sent by Armand will be 5 * m = 5m. Tyrone sent p text messages each hour for 4 hours. So, the total text messages sent by Tyrone will be 4p. Therefore, the total number of messages sent by Armand and Tyrone on Saturday afternoon is (5m + 4p).

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find the number of messages sent by Armand, we multiply the number of messages sent per hour by the number of hours: $m\cdot 5$. To find the number of messages sent by Tyrone, we multiply the number of messages sent per hour by the number of hours: $p\cdot 4$. Thus, the total number of messages sent is: $5m+4p$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To find the number of messages sent by Armand, we multiply the number of messages per hour by the number of hours. Therefore, Armand sent 5m messages. Similarly, Tyrone sent 4p messages. So the total number of message sent can be calculated by adding both messages.  
 
$5m+4p$  

Therefore, the answer is (C).

Question: A psychologist set up an experiment to study the tendency of a person to select the first item when presented with a series of items. In the experiment, 300 people were presented with a set of five pictures arranged in random order. Each person was asked to choose the most appealing picture. Of the first 150 participants, 36 chose the first picture in the set. Among the remaining 150 participants, $p$ people chose the first picture in the set. If more than $20 \%$ of all participants chose the first picture in the set, which of the following inequalities best describes the possible values of $p$ ?
Choices:
  A: $p>0.20(300-36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  B: $p>0.20(300+36)$, where $p \leq 150$
  C: $p-36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$
  D: $p+36>0.20(300)$, where $p \leq 150$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
First, find the number of people who chose the first picture among the first $150$ people: $0.24\times150=36$. For more than $20\%$ of all $300$ participants to choose the first picture,
\begin{align*}
p + 36 &> 0.20(300) \\
p &> 60 - 36 \\
p &> 24.
\end{align*}
Combining this with the fact that $p \leq 150$, we get $24<p\leq150$, or $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ p + 36>0.20(300)}$ where $p \leq 150$.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We know the line passes through the origin, that means the point (0,0) must satisfy the equation of the line. From the two given points, we can find the equation as follows: 

$$\frac{y - k}{x - 2} = \frac{k-32}{k - 2}$$

where $(2,k)$ and $(k,32)$ are the given points. To find $k$ we can substitute $x = 0$ and $y = 0$ to the above equation (since the line passes through the origin). This gives:

$$\frac{-k}{-2} = \frac{k-32}{k-2}$$

Simplify as follows:

$$(k)(k-2) = (-2)(k-32)$$

$$(k^2 -2k) + 2k - 64 = 0$$

$$k^2 - 64 = 0$$

$$(k-8)(k+8) = 0$$

Therefore, $k$ could be either $-8$ or $8$.

Question: Percent of Residents Who Earned a Bachelor's Degree or Higher\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hlineState & Percent of residents \\\hlineState A & $21.9 \%$ \\\hlineState B & $27.9 \%$ \\\hlineState C & $25.9 \%$ \\\hlineState D & $19.5 \%$ \\\hlineState E & $30.1 \%$ \\\hlineState F & $36.4 \%$ \\\hlineState G & $35.5 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}A survey was given to residents of all 50 states asking if they had earned a bachelor's degree or higher.The results from 7 of the states are given in the table above. The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states was $26.95 \%$. What is the difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states?
Choices:
  A: $0.05 \%$
  B: $0.95 \%$
  C: $1.22 \%$
  D: $7.45 \%$
Response 0:
First, we must arrange the percentages in our list in numerical order, which is:
$$19.5 \%, 21.9 \%, 25.9\%, 27.9 \%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$$
The median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states is $27.9 \%$ (the middle number in the list). The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:
$$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$$
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}  \ 0.95 \%}$.
Response 1:
To find the median of the $7$ states, we first need to order them in numerical order: 

State D, A, C, B, E, G, F.

Thus, the median of the $7$ states is $25.9 \%$. The difference between this and the median for all $50$ states, $26.95 \%$, is:

$26.95-25.9=1.05\%$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 1.22 \%}$.
Response 2:
First, we need to find the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states. Arranging the percentages in order, we get:
$19.5 \%$, $21.9 \%$, $25.9 \%$, $27.9 \%$, $30.1 \%$, $35.5 \%$, $36.4 \%$
The median of this set is $27.9 \%$.
The difference between the median percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:
$27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$
Therefore, the answer is (B) $0.95 \%$.
Response 3:
Let's first find all of the medians. For the seven states listed, the median is the average of the values in the $3$rd and $4$th rows (since $7$ is an odd number). Thus, the median for these seven states is $(25.9 + 27.9)/2 = 26.90 \%$. Since $26.95 \%$ is the median amongst all $50$ states, $26$ of which have a higher median percent and $23$ a lower median percent, the median of the lower $25$ states should be the average of the $12$th and $13$th order statistics. By doing some averaging, we get the lower median as $24.9 \%$, which means the answer is given by $26.95 \% - 26.90 \% \approx 0.05 \%$. Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 0.05 \%}$.
Response 4:
We are given the median percent of the residents who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for all 50 states which is $26.95 \%$. To find the median of 7 states, we will have to arrange the percentages in order. 

State D: $19.5 \%$  
State A: $21.9 \%$  
State C: $25.9 \%$  
State B: $27.9 \%$  
State E: $30.1 \%$  
State G: $35.5 \%$  
State F: $36.4 \%$  

As there are 7 states, the median will be the fourth value which is equal to $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median percent who earned a bachelor's degree or higher for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $27.9 \% - 26.95 \% = 0.95 \%$.  

Therefore, the answer is 

Action: Answer("B").
Response 5:
First, we need to arrange the given data in increasing order: $$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%,30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$$ The median of these seven states is the middle value, which is $27.9\%$. Then, the difference between $27.9\%$ and $26.95\%$ is $$27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%$$ Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
We need to find the median percentage of these 7 states. 

Ordering the states by percentage: 

$19.5, 21.9, 25.9, 27.9, 30.1, 35.5, 36.4$ 

The median is $27.9 \%$. 

Therefore, the difference between the median percentage of these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is $26.95 - 27.9 = -0.95  \%$. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To find the median, we need to arrange the data set in numerical order: 

$19.5\%, 21.9\%, 25.9\%, 27.9\%, 30.1\%, 35.5\%, 36.4\%$

The median percent is the middle value, which is $27.9\%$. 

The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$27.9\% - 26.95\% = 0.95\%$

Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.95 \%}$
Response 8:
To find the median, we first need to order the given values from least to greatest: 

State D: $19.5 \%$  
State A: $21.9 \%$  
State C: $25.9 \%$  
State B: $27.9 \%$  
State E: $30.1 \%$  
State G: $35.5 \%$  
State F: $36.4 \%$ 

The median is the middle value, which is $27.9 \%$. The difference between the median for these 7 states and the median for all 50 states is:

$26.95 \% - 27.9 \% = -0.95 \%$

So, the answer is:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
The given seven states are already sorted in increasing order of percent of residents who earned a bachelor's degree, so the median of these seven states is just the fourth entry, which is $25.9 \%$. The difference between $25.9 \%$ and $26.95 \%$ is $1.05 \%$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }1.22 \%}$, the only answer choice within $0.1 \%$. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }1.22 \%}$.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{c|c}Year & $\begin{array}{c}\text { Subscriptions } \\ \text { sold }\end{array}$ \\\hline2012 & 5,600 \\2013 & 5,880 \\\end{tabular}\end{center}The manager of an online news service received the report above on the number of subscriptions sold by the service. The manager estimated that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 would be double the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 . How many subscriptions did the manager expect would be sold in 2014 ?
Choices:
  A: 6,020
  B: 6,027
  C: 6,440
  D: 6,468 DIRECTIONS
Response 0:
The table above is not complete as it does not include the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Therefore, it is impossible to accurately determine the number of subscriptions the manager expected would be sold in 2014. Answer: None of the above (closest answer is A: 6,020).
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D") 

Let S be the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is (5,880 − 5,600)/5,600=0.05.
Let r be the percent increase from 2013 to 2014.
Then, the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2r.
It follows that:

(5,880+5,880r+0.05*5,880)/(2+r) = S

Solving this equation gives r=0.10 and S≈6,468.
Therefore, the answer is D) 6,468.
Response 2:
First, we need to calculate the percent increase from 2012 to 2013:
$ percent\;increase\;from\;2012\;to\;2013 = \frac{2013-2012}{2012} = 0.04 = 4\% $

Let's assume that the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is x. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is 2x. So we can calculate the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 as follows:
$ (1 + 0.04)(1 + x)^2 = 1 + 2(0.04) = 1.08$
$ (1 + x)^2 = \frac{1.08}{1.04}$
$ 1 + x = \sqrt{\frac{1.08}{1.04}}$
$ x \approx 0.019 = 1.9\%$

Now we can calculate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 as follows:
$ subscriptions\;sold\;in\;2013\;*\;(1+x) = 5,880 * (1+0.019) \approx 6,027$

Thus, the answer is (B) 6,027.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C") 

We can find the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014 using two different methods:

Method 1: Using Proportions
Let X be the number of subscriptions sold in 2013 and Y be the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
From the table, we know $\frac{Y-X}{X} = 0.1$, which means Y = 1.1X.
We also know that the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 (compared to 2012) is $\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05$, and therefore the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 (compared to 2013) is half of that, or 0.025.
So, we can set up another proportion: $\frac{Y-X}{X} = 0.025$, which simplifies to Y = 1.025X.
Now we can equate the two expressions for Y and solve for X: 1.1X = 1.025X + 150, which gives X = 6,020.
Finally, we can use the expression Y = 1.1X to find the expected number of subscriptions sold in 2014: Y = 1.1(6,020) = 6,622, which is closest to option C.

Method 2: Using Percentages
If the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is 5%, and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is half of that, or 2.5%, then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is approximately 7.5%.
Starting with 5,600 subscriptions sold in 2012, a 7.5% increase would result in approximately 6,016 subscriptions sold in 2013 (which is close to the actual value of 5,880).
Doubling that percentage, we would expect a 15% increase from 2013 to 2014. Applying that increase to the 5,880 actual subscriptions sold in 2013, we get 6,762 subscriptions sold in 2014. However, none of the answer choices match this value, so we choose the closest one, which is option C (6,440).
Response 4:
We cannot determine the answer as there is missing information. The given table only shows the number of subscriptions sold in 2012 and 2013, but there is no information given for the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
Response 5:
This question cannot be answered without additional information as there is no provided data on the number of subscriptions sold in 2014.
Response 6:
There is no data for 2014 in the given table, so we cannot directly calculate the number of subscriptions sold in 2014. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact answer to the question. Answer: None of the above (we cannot calculate an answer based on the given information).
Response 7:
Action: Answer("C") 

To solve this problem, we need to first find the percent increase from 2012 to 2013 and the percent increase from 2013 to 2014. 

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is:

$\frac{5880-5600}{5600} \approx 0.05 = 5\%$

Let the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 be $x\%$. Then the percent increase from 2012 to 2014 is $2x\%$. We want:

$2x\% = 2 \times 5\% = 10\%$

So $x=5\%$. 

Therefore, the number of subscriptions sold in 2014 is:

$5,880 + 0.05 \times 5,880 = 6,174$

But this is not one of the answer choices! However, notice that answer choice (C) is the closest to this value. 

We can estimate the answer by using answer choice (C). To increase 5,880 by 10%, we can multiply by 1.1:

$5,880 \times 1.1 = 6,468$

This is closest to answer choice (C), 6,440, so that is our choice.
Response 8:
We cannot determine how many subscriptions would be sold in 2014 since the data for that year is not given. Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above". However, the most likely answer would be (A) 6,020 since it is the closest value to the average of the subscriptions sold in 2012 and 2013.
Response 9:
Action: Answer("C")  

The percent increase from 2012 to 2013 is $\frac{5,880-5,600}{5,600} \times 100\% \approx 5\%$. Assuming $x$ subscriptions were sold in 2013, the percent increase from 2013 to 2014 is $\frac{2 \cdot (x-5,880)}{5,880} \times 100\% = \frac{2x}{98} \times 100\% = \frac{x}{49} \times 100\%$. Therefore we have that $\frac{x}{49} = 10 \times \frac{5}{100} = 0.5$, or $x = 24.5 \times 49$. Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get that $x = 1,201$. Therefore, we expect the number of subscriptions sold in $2014$ to be $1,201 \cdot 1.05 \cdot 1.1 \approx 1,201 \cdot 1.155 \approx 6,440$, which is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}}$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 36 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A company purchased a machine valued at $\$ 120,000$. The value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year so that after 10 years the value will be $\$ 30,000$. Which of the following equations gives the value, $v$, of the machine, in dollars, $t$ years after it was purchased for $0 \leq t \leq 10 ?$
Choices:
  A: $v=30,000-9,000 t$
  B: $v=120,000-9,000 t$
  C: $v=120,000+9,000 t$
  D: $v=120,000-30,000 t$
Response 0:
Using the given information we can find that the machine depreciates $\frac{\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$ 9,000$ each year. Since the value is decreasing each year, the equation that fits is a linear equation of the form: $v = \text{(initial value)} - \text{(rate of depreciation)} \cdot t.$

By plugging in $v=120,000$ and $v=30,000$, and noticing that the rate of depreciation is -$\$ 9,000$ per year, we get:

\begin{align*}
120,000 &= \text{(initial value)} - 9,000\cdot 0, \\
30,000 &= \text{(initial value)} - 9,000\cdot 10.
\end{align*}

Solving this system of equations gives us $\text{(initial value)} = \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 120{,}000-9{,}000 t}$
Response 1:
Since the machine loses $\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000 = \$ 90,000$ in value over 10 years, it loses an average of $\$ 9,000$ per year. Initially, the machine was worth $\$120,000,$ so if we count back $t$ years, the value would have decreased by $\$ 9,000 \times t.$ Hence, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is $\$120,000 - \$ 9,000 \times t.$

So, action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can find the depreciation per year by subtracting the final value from the initial value and dividing the difference by the number of years: $\frac{\$120,\!000-\$30,\!000}{10 \text{ years}}=\$9,\!000$ per year.

Let $v$ be the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased, where $0 \leq t \leq 10$. Since the machine depreciates by $\$9,\!000$ per year, its value after $t$ years will be $v = \$120,\!000 -(\$9,\!000)(t)$. Therefore: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
We start at $\$ 120,000$ and the value of the machine depreciates by the same amount each year, so we can find the amount of depreciation each year by subtracting the final value from the initial value and dividing by the number of years: 

$\frac{\$ 120,000 - \$ 30,000}{10 \text{ years}} = \$ 9,000$

Therefore, the value $t$ years after it was purchased can be written as:

$v = \$ 120,000 - \$ 9,000t$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To start, we can find the rate at which the value of the machine is depreciating by calculating the depreciation per year: $$\frac{120,\!000-30,\!000}{10}= 9,\!000.$$ 
This tells us that the value of the machine is decreasing by $9,\!000$ dollars per year. The value of the machine at the time it is purchased (when $t=0$) is $\$120,\!000$. Therefore, after $t$ years, the value of the machine can be expressed as: $$v=120,\!000-9,\!000t.$$ 

This means the correct answer is: 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let the value that depreciates each year be $d$. From the given information, we know that $d=\frac{120,000-30,000}{10}=9,000$. This means that the machine depreciates by $9,000$ dollars each year.

The initial value of the machine is $\$ 120,000$. After $t$ years, the amount the value has depreciated is $9,000t$. Therefore, the value of the machine $t$ years after it was purchased is:
$$v=120,000-9,000t$$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Ken is working this summer as part of a crew on a farm. He earned $\$ 8$ per hour for the first 10 hours he worked this week. Because of his performance, his crew leader raised his salary to $\$ 10$ per hour for the rest of the week. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. What is the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week?
Choices:
  A: 38
  B: 33
  C: 22
  D: 16
Response 0:
First, let's find out his earnings for the first 10 hours which is $8 \times 10 = 80$
Let's let $x$ be the number of hours he needs to work the rest of the week. $\$ 10$ is his hourly rate for the next $x$ hours. Thus, he will earn $10x$ for the remaining hours. Therefore, his total earnings for the week is $80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week. So his savings is $0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x$.
We want to find the least number of hours $x$ so that his savings will be at least $\$ 270$. Therefore, we have the inequality $72+9x \geq 270$.
Solving for $x$, we get $9x \geq 198$, which means $x \geq 22$.
Thus, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$ 270$ for the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 1:
First, we need to calculate how much money Ken makes in a week. Ken earns $\$8$ per hour in the first $10$ hours of the week, so he earns $8 \cdot 10 = 80$ dollars. For the remaining part of the week, Ken earns $\$10$ per hour. Let $x$ be the number of hours he works during the remaining part of the week. Thus, he earns $10x$ dollars during this period. Hence, his total earnings in one week is:
$$80 + 10x$$

Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings each week. This means that he spends only $10\%$ of his earnings:
$$0.1(80+10x)$$

We now set up the inequality, which should represent the minimum number of hours he works to make at least $\$270$:
$$0.1(80+10x) \ge 270$$
Simplifying, we have:
$$8 + x \ge 27$$
Subtracting 8 from both sides yields:
$$x \ge 19$$
Thus, the least number of hours he must work the rest of the week is $19$, so the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } 22}$.
Response 2:
Let's first find out how much he earned for the first 10 hours:
$\$8$ per hour $\times$ 10 hours $=$ $\$80$

Next, let's find the amount he needs to save from the remaining hours:
He needs to save at least $\$270$ for the week. 
Out of his total pay, he saves $90 \%$. So, he keeps $100 \% - 90 \% = 10 \%$ of his pay.
This means he spends $100 \% - 10 \% = 90 \%$ of his pay.
So, he must earn $\dfrac{\$270}{0.9} = \$300$ in the remaining hours.

Let $x$ be the number of hours he needs to work. 

From this point, we can make an inequality to solve for $x$: 

$(x)(\$10 \text { per hour}) \ge \$300$

$x \ge 30$ 

Ken needs to work at least $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$ additional hours to meet his saving goal, so that he can save \$270 for the week.
Response 3:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken worked after his raise. His total earnings before saving can be expressed as $8 \cdot 10 + 10x$. Since he saves 90% of his earnings, he saves $0.9(8 \cdot 10 + 10x)$. We set this amount as greater than or equal to 270 dollars and solve for $x$:
\begin{align*}
0.9(8 \cdot 10 + 10x) &\geq 270\\
72 + 9x &\geq 270 \quad\div 9\\
8+x &\geq 30\\ 
x &\geq 22\\
\end{align*}

Therefore, the least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }22}$.
Response 4:
Let the number of hours he worked the rest of the week be $x$. Ken worked a total of $10+x$ hours. 
The amount he earned from the first 10 hours is $8\times 10 = 80$ dollars.
The amount he earned from the rest of the week is $10x$ dollars.
Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, his savings will be $0.9(80 + 10x)$ dollars.
We want to solve the following inequality for $x$: $$0.9(80+10x)\geq 270.$$ Simplifying the inequality, we get $8 + x \geq 9$. Therefore $x \geq 1$ hour, and the least number of hours he must work is $x= \boxed{\textbf{(D) }16}$.
Response 5:
Let's let $x$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. Then his total earnings for the week are $10x + 80$ dollars. Ken saves $90\%$ of his earnings. So Ken saved $0.9(10x+80)$ dollars, which must be greater than or equal to $\$ 270$. Solving the inequality gives us $10x+80\geq 300$, or $x \geq \dfrac{22}{5}$. We need to round up to the nearest hour, so Ken needs to work $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 38}$ hours.
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work at $\$10$ per hour. Then, his earnings for the week can be represented as: $$\text{Total Earnings} = (\$8 \times 10) + (\$10 \times x) = 80 + 10x.$$ Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings, so his savings for the week can be represented as: $$0.9(\text{Total Earnings}) = 0.9(80+10x) = 72+9x.$$ To save at least $\$270$ for the week, we must have: $$72+9x \geq 270 \implies 9x \geq 198 \implies x \geq 22.$$ The least number of hours Ken must work the rest of the week to save at least $\$270$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 22}$.
Response 7:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. 

The amount he earns for the first 10 hours is: $8 \times 10 = 80$ dollars. 

The amount he earns for the remaining $h$ hours at a rate of $\$10$ per hour is: $10h$ dollars. 

So, the total amount he earns for the week is $80 + 10h$ dollars. 

Since Ken saves $90 \%$ of his earnings from each week, he saves $0.9(80 + 10h) = 72 + 9h$ dollars every week. 

We need to find the least number of hours $h$ such that $72 + 9h \ge 270$. 

Simplifying this inequality, we get $9h \ge 198$, which implies that $h \ge 22$. 

So the least number of hours he must work is $22$. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\text{(C) }22}$.
Response 8:
Let $x$ be the number of hours Ken needs to work at the increased salary of $\$10$ per hour. The total amount Ken will earn this week is $8 \cdot 10 + 10x = 80+10x$. Ken saves $90 \%$ of this, so the total amount he saves is $0.9(80+10x)=72+9x$.
We want this savings amount to be at least $\$ 270$. So we get the inequality $72+9x\geq 270$, which gives $x\geq 22$.
The smallest integer greater than or equal to $22$ that is a choice is $33$, so we choose:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Let $h$ be the number of hours Ken works for the rest of the week. The total amount he earns during the first 10 hours is $8\times10=80$ dollars. Therefore, he needs to earn $270-0.9(80)=190$ dollars from the rest of the week. Since he earns $\$10$ per hour for the rest of the week, we can set up the equation $10h \ge 190$, or $h \ge 19$. Therefore, the least number of hours he must work is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }38}$.

Question: \begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}\hline$x$ & $f(x)$ \\\hline0 & 3 \\\hline2 & 1 \\\hline4 & 0 \\\hline5 & -2 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The function $f$ is defined by a polynomial. Some values of $x$ and $f(x)$ are shown in the table above. Which of the following must be a factor of $f(x)$ ?
Choices:
  A: $x-2$
  B: $x-3$
  C: $x-4$
  D: $x-5$
Response 0:
To find a factor of $f(x)$ when it is defined by a polynomial, we must look for the roots of $f(x)$. Roots are also known as x-intercepts where $f(x) = 0$. To solve this, we can use linear interpolation and look for an x value that will yield a zero f(x) value. Another method is trial and error. Using either method, we can see that $x = 4$ gives $f(x) = 0$, so $x-4$ is a factor of $f(x)$.
 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
To find a factor of $f(x)$, we can try to compute the polynomial using the given values and then look for a common factor. To do so, we can use the method of Lagrange interpolation :

$f(x)=3\cdot\dfrac{(x-2)(x-4)(x-5)}{(0-2)(0-4)(0-5)}+1\cdot\dfrac{(x-0)(x-4)(x-5)}{(2-0)(2-4)(2-5)}+0\cdot\dfrac{(x-0)(x-2)(x-5)}{(4-0)(4-2)(4-5)}-2\cdot\dfrac{(x-0)(x-2)(x-4)}{(5-0)(5-2)(5-4)}$

Simplifying this expression, we get:

$f(x)=\dfrac{1}{20}(3x^3-38x^2+105x-50)$

We want to identify a factor of this polynomial. Using the remainder theorem, we know that if $f(a)=0$ for some number $a$, then $x-a$ is a factor of $f(x)$. Checking the choices, we find that:

$f(2)=1,$
$f(4)=0,$
$f(5)=-2,$
$f(0)=\dfrac{-50}{20}=-\dfrac{5}{2}.$

Therefore, $x-4$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. Thus, the answer is:

Response 5:
Solution: Using the values in the table, we see that $f(2)=1$ and $f(5)=-2$, so the polynomial must have a factor of $(x-2)(x-5)$. To confirm our answer, we can check that the other answer choices do not necessarily factor into this polynomial. For example, if $f(x)$ were a quadratic with leading coefficient 1, we could use the sum and product of roots formula to determine that the roots must be 2 and 5. Then, $f(x)$ would be of the form $(x-2)(x-5)+c$ for some constant $c$, so none of the other answer choices would necessarily be a factor. Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ x-5}$.
Response 6:
In order for a linear function $(x-a)$ to be a factor of a polynomial function $f(x)$, $f(a)$ must be equal to 0. Let us plug in the given values of $x$ in the given function $f(x)$:
\begin{align*}
f(0)&=3 \neq 0 \\
f(2)&=1 \neq 0 \\
f(4)&=0 = 0 \\
f(5)&=-2 \neq 0\\  
\end{align*}
So, We can see that $f(4)=0$ and therefore $(x-4)$ must be a factor of $f(x)$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Let's try finding the degree of the polynomial using the table. Since we are going down in values for x and f(x) is going down to successive decreasing values, this suggests a degree of at most 2. We can attempt to solve for the coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ of the polynomial. 

For the polynomial $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$, we can plug the values of x and f(x) from the table into the following system of 3 equations and 3 variables to find $a$, $b$, and $c$.
$\begin{aligned} 0^2a+0b+c &=3\\ 2^2a+2b+c &=1\\ 4^2a+4b+c &=0 \end{aligned}$

Solving this system, we find $a=-\frac{1}{4}$, $b=\frac{17}{4}$, and $c=-3$. Therefore, the polynomial is $f(x)=-\frac{1}{4}x^2+\frac{17}{4}x-3$.

Now we need to find the factor(s). We can simply plug in each answer choice and check if they are factors of $f(x)$, or we see that $x-2$ is a factor since $f(2)=1$.

Response 9:
There are different methods to approach this problem, but one way is to use polynomial interpolation. Since the table shows four points, we can define a polynomial $p(x)$ of degree at most 3 that passes through these points. One such polynomial is $$p(x)=3-\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-4)-\frac{1}{4}(x-2)(x-4)(x-5).$$ We can check that $p(0)=3$, $p(2)=1$, $p(4)=0$, and $p(5)=-2$. Therefore, $p(x)=f(x)$ and any factor of $p(x)$ is also a factor of $f(x)$. We can factor $p(x)$ as $$p(x)=-\frac{1}{4}(x-2)(x-4)(x-5)+\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-4)+3=(x-2)\left[\frac{1}{4}(x-4)(5-x)-1\right].$$ Hence, $x-2$ is a factor of $p(x)$, and by extension, a factor of $f(x)$.

Question: In the $x y$-plane, the parabola with equation $y=(x-11)^{2}$ intersects the line with equation $y=25$ at two points, $A$ and $B$. What is the length of $\overline{A B}$ ?
Choices:
  A: 10
  B: 12
  C: 14
  D: 16
Response 0:
We know that the equation of the parabola is $y=(x-11)^2$ and the equation of the line is $y=25$. We can substitute $y=25$ into the equation of the parabola to get $25=(x-11)^2$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $|x-11|=5$. So $x=-4$ or $x=16$. Therefore, the coordinates of $A$ and $B$ are $(-4,25)$ and $(16,25)$, respectively. Using the distance formula, we have:

$$\sqrt{(16-(-4))^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{20^2}=20$$

Therefore, the length of $\overline{A B}$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ 16}$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
First we solve for the $x$ coordinates of the intersection points by substituting $y = 25$ in the equation of the parabola:
$$25 = (x - 11)^2$$
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
$$5 = x-11 \quad\text{or}\quad -5 = x-11$$
So, we have $x=6$ or $x=16$.

Therefore, the points of intersection of the parabola and the line are $(6, 25)$ and $(16, 25)$.

The length of $AB$ is then:
$$AB = |6-16| = 10$$

Answer: $\textbf{(A)}\ 10$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Let's start by setting $(x-11)^2=25$ and solve for x: 
$(x-11)^2=25 \\
x-11=\pm5 \\
x=6, x=16$ 

So the parabola intersects the line at x=6 and x=16. We can plug these x-values back into the equation for the parabola to find the corresponding y-values: 

$y=(6-11)^2=25$ and $y=(16-11)^2=25$ 

So points $A$ and $B$ are $(6,25)$ and $(16,25)$, respectively. The distance between these points is:

$\sqrt{(16-6)^2+(25-25)^2}=\sqrt{100}=10$

Thus the answer is (A) 10.

Question: Oil and gas production in a certain area dropped from 4 million barrels in 2000 to 1.9 million barrels in 2013. Assuming that the oil and gas production decreased at a constant rate, which of the following linear functions $f$ best models the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after the year 2000 ?
Choices:
  A: $f(t)=\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  B: $f(t)=\frac{19}{130} t+4$
  C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$
  D: $f(t)=-\frac{19}{130} t+4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which oil and gas production is decreasing per year. We can do this by finding the slope of the line that passes through the two given data points: (0, 4) and (13, 1.9). 

The slope $m$ of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by the formula:

$$m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$$

Substituting the coordinates of the given points, we have:

$$m = \frac{1.9 - 4}{13 - 0} = -\frac{21}{130}$$

So the slope of the linear function that best models the production is $-\frac{21}{130}$, which eliminates choices A and B.

We know that when $t=0$, the production is 4 million barrels, so the y-intercept of the linear function is 4. This eliminates choice D.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We can use the slope-intercept equation of a line to model the decrease in millions of barrels per year. 

slope $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{1.9-4}{2013-2000}=\frac{-2.1}{13}$

We need to find the y-intercept, which is the point where $t=0$,

$y = mx + b \Rightarrow 4=-\frac{2.1}{13}(0)+b \Rightarrow b=4$

So the equation of the line is, $f(t)=-\frac{2.1}{13}t+4$

Simplifying the equation will yield $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }f(t)=-\frac{21}{130}t+4}.$
Response 5:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To find out which linear function models the oil and gas production best, we need to calculate the slope of the linear function. The slope is given by the rate of change in oil and gas production per year.

The total change in oil and gas production from 2000 to 2013 is: 

$1.9-4=-2.1$

This is a change of $-2.1$ million barrels over a period of $13$ years. So, the rate of change in oil and gas production is:

$-\frac{2.1 \text{ million barrels}}{13 \text{ years}}=-\frac{21}{130}$ million barrels per year.

This means the production decreased by 0.162 million barrels per year. The function that models this change is:

$f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 8:
To find the answer, we need to use the slope-intercept form of the equation of a line: $y = mx+b$, where $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is $m=\frac{(y_2-y_1)}{(x_2-x_1)}$. In this case, we have two points: $(0,4)$ (the starting point in the year 2000 when $t=0$) and $(13,1.9)$ (the endpoint in the year 2013 when $t=13$). Using the slope formula, we get: $m=\frac{(1.9-4)}{(13-0)}=-\frac{21}{130}$. Therefore, the answer is C: $f(t)=-\frac{21}{130} t+4$.
Response 9:
The total decrease in production from 2000 to 2013 was $4-1.9=2.1$ million barrels. Since this decrease occurred over $2013-2000=13$ years, the production decreased at an average rate of $2.1/13\approx 0.1615$ million barrels per year. Therefore, the production, in millions of barrels, $t$ years after 2000, can be modeled by the linear function $f(t)=4-0.1615t$, where $t$ represents the number of years since 2000.

Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
We can interpret the table as three points on a line: $(1,5)$, $(3,13)$, and $(5,21)$. To find the equation of the line, we can find its slope and $y$-intercept. The slope is equal to the change in $f$ divided by the corresponding change in $x$. From $x=1$ to $x=3$, $f$ increases by $13-5=8$, so the change in $f$ is 8. From $x=1$ to $x=3$, $x$ increases by 2, so the corresponding change in $x$ is 2. Therefore, the slope of the line is $\frac{8}{2}=4$. 

To find the $y$-intercept, we can pick one of the three points and solve for $b$ in the equation $f(x)=4x+b$. Let's use the point $(1,5)$: $5=4(1)+b$, so $b=1$. Therefore, the equation of the line is $f(x)=4x+1$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
We can find the slope of the line passing through any two points of the table using the slope formula: $$m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}.$$Taking $(x_1, y_1) = (1, 5)$ and $(x_2, y_2) = (3,13)$, we get $m=4$. Therefore, any equation for $f$ must be of the form $f(x) = 4x+b$. Substituting $x=1$ into this expression and using $f(1) = 5$, we can solve for $b$ to get $b=1$. Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the problem, we need to calculate the slope (rate of change) of the function $f$:

Slope (rate of change) $=\dfrac{\text{change in }y}{\text{change in }x}=\dfrac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\dfrac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2-x_1}$.

Using any two coordinates from the table, we can calculate the slope; let's use $(x_1,f(x_1))=(1,5)$ and $(x_2,f(x_2))=(5,21)$:

Slope (rate of change) $=\dfrac{21-5}{5-1}=\dfrac{16}{4}=4$

So the slope of $f$ is 4. Now we need to find the $y$-intercept of $f$ (the value of $f$ when $x=0$). We can use any coordinate from the table; let's use $(1,5)$:

$f(x)-f(x_1)=m(x-x_1)\quad\Rightarrow\quad f(x)-5=4(x-1)\quad\Rightarrow\quad f(x)=4 x+1$

Therefore, the equation that defines $f$ is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }f(x)=4x+1}$.
Response 6:
We can start by looking at the difference in outputs of the function for a difference of one in the input. Going from $x=1$ to $x=3$, the output increases by $13-5=8$. Going from $x=3$ to $x=5$, the output increases by $21-13=8$. This tells us the function has a constant rate of change of $8$ for a difference of one in the input. Now, we can use the point-slope form of a linear equation to find the equation of the line. Letting $(x_1,y_1)=(1,5)$ be one point on the line, we have: $$f(x)-y_1=8(x-x_1)$$ Simplifying this gives: $$f(x)=8x-3$$
So the answer is $\textbf{(A)}$ $f(x)=\boxed{8x-3}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Notice how $f(x)$ increases by $8$ as $x$ increases by $2$ as shown in the table.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
One way to solve the problem is first find two points that appear in two rows of the table, and then use those points to find the slope of the line. We can then use the point-slope formula for the equation of a line to find the function $f$.

For example, using the points $(1,5)$ and $(5,21)$, we can find the slope of the line as:

$$\frac{f(5)-f(1)}{5-1}=\frac{21-5}{4}=4$$

So the slope of the line is 4. Using the point-slope formula with the point $(1,5)$, we have:

$$f(x)-f(1)=4(x-1)$$

Simplifying gives:

$$f(x)=4x+1$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $f(x)=4 x+1$.

Question: Dreams Recalled during One Week\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|}\hline& None & 1 to 4 & 5 or more & Total \\\hline\hlineGroup X & 15 & 28 & 57 & 100 \\\hlineGroup Y & 21 & 11 & 68 & 100 \\\hlineTotal & 36 & 39 & 125 & 200 \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The data in the table above were produced by a sleep researcher studying the number of dreams people recall when asked to record their dreams for one week. Group X consisted of 100 people who observed early bedtimes, and Group Y consisted of 100 people who observed later bedtimes. If a person is chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream, what is the probability that the person belonged to Group Y ?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{68}{100}$
  B: $\frac{79}{100}$
  C: $\frac{79}{164}$
  D: $\frac{164}{200}$
Response 0:
Total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is 39+125=164.
Out of these, 68 belong to Group Y.
Therefore, the probability of a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least 1 dream belonging to Group Y is: 

$$\frac{68}{164}$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$\frac{17}{41}$$

Hence, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
The probability of a person belonging to Group Y given that the person recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the probability of the person being from Group Y and recalling at least 1 dream divided by the probability of recalling at least 1 dream. 

The probability of recalling at least 1 dream is equal to the sum of the number of people who recalled 1 to 4 dreams and the number of people who recalled 5 or more dreams divided by the total number of people: 

$P(\text{recall at least 1 dream})$ $= \frac{39+125}{200} = \frac{164}{200}$ 

The probability of a person being from Group Y and recalling at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled 1 or more dreams divided by the total number of people who recalled 1 or more dreams:

$P(\text{Group Y and recall at least 1 dream})$ $= \frac{68}{39+125} = \frac{68}{164}$ 

Therefore, 

$P(\text{Group Y }|\text{ recall at least 1 dream})$ $= \frac{P(\text{Group Y and recall at least 1 dream})}{P(\text{recall at least 1 dream})}$ $= \frac{68/164}{164/200} = \frac{85}{164}$ 

So the answer is (C): $\frac{79}{164}$
Response 2:
The probability of choosing someone who belongs to Group Y and recalled at least one dream is equal to the number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least one dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is the sum of the people in Group X and Group Y who did so: 

$28+57+11+68 = 164$

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least one dream is 11 + 68 = 79. So the probability of choosing someone from Group Y who recalled at least one dream is:

$$\frac{79}{164}$$

Therefore, the correct answer is (C) $\frac{79}{164}$.
Response 3:
Out of the 39 people who recalled at least one dream, 68-11=57 people who recalled five or more were from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a person chosen at random from those who recalled at least one dream belonged to Group Y is:

$$\frac{57}{39}= \frac{19}{13}$$

We note that $\frac{19}{13}$ is not one of the answer choices. So we need to simplify it as follows:

$$\frac{19}{13}=\frac{19}{13} \cdot \frac{4}{4}=\frac{76}{52}= \frac{38}{26}= \frac{19}{13} \cdot \frac{2}{2}= \frac{38}{26}= \frac{14}{13}$$

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}$.
Response 4:
The probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream is $\frac{125}{200}=\frac{5}{8}$. 
The probability that a person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{100}{200}=\frac{1}{2}$. 
The probability that a person recalled at least one dream and belonged in Group Y is $\frac{68}{200}=\frac{17}{50}$. 

Therefore, the probability that a person recalled at least 1 dream and belonged to Group Y is $\frac{17}{50}\div\frac{5}{8}=\frac{68}{100}=\boxed{\textbf{(A) }\frac{68}{100}}$.
Response 5:
The probability that the person belonged to Group Y is given by $\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}}.$ So we need to first calculate each of these quantities.

The number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79.$ The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164.$ Therefore, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is \[
\frac{\text{number of people in Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream}}{\text{total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream}} = \frac{79}{164}.
\] Answer: $\boxed{\textbf{(C) }\frac{79}{164}}$
Response 6:
The probability of selecting a person from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is equal to the number of people from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream divided by the total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream. 

The total number of people who recalled at least 1 dream is $39+125=164$.

The number of people from Group Y who recalled at least 1 dream is $11+68=79$.

Therefore, the probability that the randomly chosen person belonged to Group Y is: 

$$\frac{79}{164}$$ 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
The probability of selecting a person who recalled at least one dream is $\frac{125+39}{200}=0.82$.  Of these, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\frac{68}{125 +39} = \frac{68}{164} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ \frac{79}{164}}$.

Out of the total of 200 people, 39 recalled one or more dreams. Out of those 39, 68 were from Group Y. Therefore, the probability that a random person who recalled at least 1 dream is from Group Y is: 

$$ \frac{68}{39} \approx 1.744 $$

However, since we are only looking for the probability that the person belonged to Group Y, the answer should be: 

Action: Answer("A") $\frac{68}{100}$
Response 9:
The total number of people who recalled at least one dream is $39+125=164$.  Of these, 68 belonged to Group Y.  Thus, the probability that the person belonged to Group Y is $\dfrac{68}{164} = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{79}{164}}$.

Topic: Math
Question: $$C=75 h+125$$The equation above gives the amount $C$, in dollars, an electrician charges for a job that takes $h$ hours. Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland each hired this electrician. The electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. How much more did the electrician charge Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland?
Choices:
  A: $\$ 75$
  B: $\$ 125$
  C: $\$ 150$
  D: $\$ 275$
Response 0:
Let's first find out how long the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez and Mr. Roland respectively. 

We know that for Ms. Sanchez's job, $h+2$ hours were worked. For Mr. Roland's job, $h$ hours were worked.

Now, let's calculate the amount charged for each job using the given equation.

For Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$C_1 = 75(h+2)+125=75h+225+125=75h+350$$

For Mr. Roland's job:
$$C_2 = 75h+125$$

The difference in the amount charged is:
$$C_1 - C_2 = (75h+350) - (75h+125) = 225$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 225$ more than Mr. Roland.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Let's first start by calculating how much the electrician charged for Mr. Roland's job. 

Since we don't know how many hours Mr. Roland's job took, let's call that number of hours "x". 

Then, using the formula given in the question, we get: 

$C=75h+125$ 

$C = 75x + 125$ 

Now, we can calculate how much the electrician charged for Ms. Sanchez's job. 

Since the electrician worked 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job, the number of hours for that job is "x+2". 

Therefore, the cost for Ms. Sanchez's job is: 

$C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$

To find out how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we need to subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job: 

$75x + 225 - (75x + 125) = \boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}$
Response 2:
Let's call the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland as $x$. Then the number of hours he worked for Ms. Sanchez would be $x+2$. We can use the equation given to find the costs for each job:
- For Mr. Roland's job: $C = 75x + 125$
- For Ms. Sanchez's job: $C = 75(x+2) + 125 = 75x + 225$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $75x+225$ dollars and charged Mr. Roland $75x+125$ dollars. To find out how much more the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez than Mr. Roland, we can subtract the cost of Mr. Roland's job from the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job:
$$(75x+225) - (75x+125) = 100$$

So the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$100$ more than Mr. Roland.
 
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("None of the above")  (None of the given choices match the answer)
Response 3:
First, we need to find the value of $C$ for each individual jobs. Let $h_1$ and $h_2$ be the hours worked on Mr. Roland's job and Ms. Sanchez's job respectively. We know that $h_2 = h_1 + 2$. Therefore, $C_1=75h_1+125$ and $C_2=75(h_1+2)+125=75h_1+175$. Then, the difference in the charge is $\Delta C = C_2-C_1=75h_1+175-(75h_1+125)=50$. Hence, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ \$75}$.
Response 4:
The electrician charged $\$75h + \$125$ for a job that took $h$ hours. Let's call the number of hours for Mr. Roland's job $r$. Therefore, Ms. Sanchez's job took $r+2$ hours. 

The electrician charged Ms. Sanchez: 
$$C = 75(r+2) + 125$$ 
and charged Mr. Roland: 
$$C = 75r + 125$$
We want to know the difference between the two charges, which is:
$$(75(r+2) +125) - (75r+125) = 75r + 150 - 75r = 150$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C") $\$150$
Response 5:
Let's start by finding the cost for Mr. Roland's job. We know that $C=75h+125$, and we'll call the number of hours the electrician worked for Mr. Roland as $h_r$. So, for Mr. Roland,$$C_r=75h_r+125$$ Now we're told that the electrician worked for 2 hours longer on Ms. Sanchez's job than on Mr. Roland's job. So, the number of hours the electrician worked for Ms. Sanchez is $(h_r+2)$. So, the cost for Ms. Sanchez's job is$$C_s=75(h_r+2)+125$$ We want to find the difference between the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job and Mr. Roland's job. So, we'll subtract $C_r$ from $C_s$. \begin{align*}
C_s-C_r&=75(h_r+2)+125-(75h_r+125)\\
&=75h_r+150+125-75h_r-125\\
&=\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \$150}
\end{align*}
Response 6:
First, let's find how much time it took the electrician on Mr. Roland's job by letting $h$ be the number of hours for that job. Since he worked 2 hours longer for Ms. Sanchez's job, the electrician worked for $h+2$ hours on Ms. Sanchez's job. 

Using the given equation, the amount charged for Mr. Roland's job is $C=75h+125$. For Ms. Sanchez's job, the amount charged would be $C=75(h+2)+125=75h+225$. 

To find the difference in the amounts charged, we subtract the amount for Mr. Roland's job from the amount for Ms. Sanchez's job:

$$(75h+225)-(75h+125)=\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ \$150}$$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $\$150$.
Response 7:
We can start the problem by using the equation given to determine how much the electrician charged each person. Let $h_1$ be the number of hours worked on Mr. Roland's job. Then, the number of hours worked on Ms. Sanchez's job is $h_1 + 2$. Therefore, the amount charged to Mr. Roland is $C = 75h_1 + 125$, and the amount charged to Ms. Sanchez is $C = 75(h_1+2) + 125$. We want to find the difference between the two amounts, which is
$$(75(h_1+2) + 125) - (75h_1 + 125) = 150.$$
So the answer is $\$150$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Solution: 

Let $h_r$ be the number of hours the electrician worked on Mr. Roland's job.
Then, the electrician worked $(h_r+2)$ hours on Ms. Sanchez’s job.

The cost of Ms. Sanchez's job: $C_s=75(h_r+2)+125=75h_r+275$
The cost of Mr. Roland's job: $C_r=75h_r+125$

The difference of the costs: $$C_s-C_r=(75h_r+275)-(75h_r+125)=\boxed{\$ 150}\text{ (or answer choice } \textbf{(C)})$$

Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$150$ more than Mr. Roland.
Response 9:
Let's first find the cost of the job for Mr. Roland. Let's assume that the electrician worked for $x$ hours on his job. This means that $x + 2$ hours were spent on Ms. Sanchez's job. Since C is the amount charged for h hours, then
$$C = 75h+125$$
For Mr. Roland's job, we have $h = x$ and so the cost of the job would be $C = 75\times x+125$.
For Ms. Sanchez's job, we have $h = x + 2$ and so the cost of the job would be $C = 75(x+2)+125$.
The difference in cost would be the cost of Ms. Sanchez's job minus the cost of Mr. Roland's job:
$$(75(x+2)+125) - (75x+125) = 75x + 150 - 75x = 150$$
Therefore, the electrician charged Ms. Sanchez $\$ 150$ more than Mr. Roland.

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Energy per Gram of Typical Macronutrients.\begin{center}.\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|}.\hline.Macronutrient & Food calories & Kilojoules \\.\hline.Protein & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.Fat & 9.0 & 37.7 \\.\hline.Carbohydrate & 4.0 & 16.7 \\.\hline.\end{tabular}.\end{center}.The table above gives the typical amounts of energy per gram, expressed in both food calories and kilojoules, of the three macronutrients in food.
Question: If the 180 food calories in a granola bar come entirely from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, which of the following expresses $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$ ?
Choices:
  A: $f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  B: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$
  C: $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$
  D: $f=20+\frac{9}{4}(p+c)$
Response 0:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ represent the energy in food calories per gram of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Since the granola bar contains 180 food calories and $p$, $f$, and $c$ grams of protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively, we have $180=Ep\:+\:E_f\:f+E_c\:c$. Substituting $E_p = 4.0, E_f = 9.0, E_c = 4.0$, we have $180=4.0p+9.0f+4.0c$. Solving for $f$, we get $f=\frac{1}{9}(180-4.0p-4.0c)=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$. Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(B) }f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 1:
We can express the total number of grams of the three macronutrients as $p+f+c$, and we know that the total number of food calories from these nutrients is $180$. Since each gram of protein contributes $4$ food calories and each gram of fat and carbohydrate contributes $9$ food calories, the total number of food calories coming from protein is $4p$, the total number coming from fat is $9f$, and the total number coming from carbohydrate is $4c$. Therefore, we have the equation $$4p+9f+4c=180.$$ Solving for $f$ yields $$f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).$$ 

Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 2:
We have that the 180 calories in the granola bar come entirely from the protein, fat, and carbohydrate. So we can set up two equations from this information: $$4p+9f+4c=180 \quad \text{and} \quad 16.7p+37.7f+16.7c=180 \cdot\frac{4.184}{1},$$the second equation being the conversion from food calories to kilojoules.

Multiplying the first equation by $4.184/1$ gives $16.736p+37.732f+16.736c=752.88$. Subtracting four times this equation from the second equation gives $-120.128p+3.28f-120.128c=-1269.12$. Solving for $f$, we find:

\begin{align*}
-120.128p+3.28f-120.128c&=-1269.12 \\
3.28f &= 120.128p+120.128c-1269.12\\
f &= 36.65p+36.65c-387.2\\
f &= 36.65(p+c)-387.2\\
f &= 36.65(p+c)-36650 \cdot 0.01\\
f &= 20 + 0.4045(p+c).
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }f=20+\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$.
Response 3:
We can set up equations based on the information given. We know that: 

$4p + 9f + 4c = 180$ (since all the calories come from protein, fat, and carbohydrate)
$f = \frac{180 - 4p - 4c}{9}$ (solve for $f$)

Simplifying the second equation: 

$f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}p - \frac{4}{9}c$

So the answer is (B): $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 4:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ denote the energy (in calories) supplied by the $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, respectively. 

We are given that the 180 calories of the granola bar satisfy $E_p + E_f + E_c = 180$ and $E_p = 4p$, $E_f = 9f$, and $E_c = 4c$.

Substituting gives $4p + 9f + 4c = 180$, or $f = \frac{-4}{9} (p+c) + 20$.

Therefore, the answer is:

$$\boxed{\textbf{(B) } f = 20 - \frac{4}{9}(p+c)}$$
Response 5:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ be the energy, in food calories, from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, respectively. 

We know that $E_p = 4p$, $E_f=9f$, and $E_c = 4c$. We also know that the total energy is 180 food calories, so $180=E_p+E_f+E_c=4p+9f+4c$. Solving for $f$ gives:

$4p+9f+4c=180$ 

$9f=176-4p-4c$

$f=\frac{176-4p-4c}{9}=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 6:
To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation with the given information. We know that the 180 food calories in the granola bar come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate. Using the table above, we can convert these quantities to energy:

$4p$ food calories come from protein,
$9f$ food calories come from fat, and
$4c$ food calories come from carbohydrate.

Since the total number of food calories is 180, we have the equation:

$$4p+9f+4c = 180$$

We want to solve for $f$ in terms of $p$ and $c$. First, we can isolate the term involving $f$:

$$9f = 180-4p-4c$$

Then, we can divide both sides by 9:

$$f = 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$$

Therefore, the answer is (B) $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)$.
Response 7:
Let $E_p$, $E_f$, and $E_c$ represent the energy (measured in food calories) supplied by protein, fat, and carbohydrate, respectively. Since the total of 180 food calories comes from protein, fat, and carbohydrate, we have $E_p+E_f+E_c=180.$ Using the conversion factors in the table, we have $E_p=4p,$ $E_f=9f,$ and $E_c=4c,$ so this equation can be rewritten as $4p+9f+4c=180.$ Solving for $f$, we find: $$\begin{aligned} 4p+9f+4c&=180 \\ 9f&=176-4p-4c \\ f&=\frac{176-4p-4c}{9} \\ &=\frac{44-p-c}{\frac{9}{4}} \\ &=\frac{44-p-c}{2.25} \\ &=20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c).  \end{aligned}$$Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ f = 20-\frac{4}{9}(p+c)}.$
Response 8:
To solve this problem, we need to set up an equation involving $p$, $f$, and $c$ and solve for $f$. Since we know that the total 180 food calories come from $p$ grams of protein, $f$ grams of fat, and $c$ grams of carbohydrate, we can write:

\begin{align*}
180 &= 4p + 9f + 4c\\
180 &= 4(p + c) + 5f
\end{align*}

Solving for $f$, we get:

\begin{align*}
5f &= 180 - 4(p + c)\\
5f &= 180 - 4p - 4c\\
f &= 36 - \frac{4}{5}(p + c)\\
f &= 36 - \frac{4}{5}p - \frac{4}{5}c\\
f &= 20 + \frac{1}{5}(c - p)
\end{align*}

Therefore, the answer is $\textbf{(C)}$ $f=20-\frac{4}{9}(p-c)$.
Response 9:
We can set up the following system of equations: 

$4p+9f+4c=180$ (where 180 is the total number of food calories)

Simplifying: 

$4p+4c=180-9f$

$2p+2c=90-\frac{9}{2}f$

$p+c=45-\frac{9}{8}f$

$f=40-\frac{8}{9}(p+c)$

Response 5:
To find the equilibrium price, we need to find the price, P, at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded. That is, where $S(P) = D(P)$. Substituting for $S(P)$ and $D(P)$, we get: 
$$ \frac{1}{2} P+40 = 220-P. $$
Solving for P: 
$$ \begin{aligned} \frac{1}{2} P+P &= 220 - 40 \\ \frac{3}{2} P &= 180 \\ P &= \frac{360}{3} = 120. \end{aligned} $$

Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
To find the price at which the quantity of the supplied product equals the demanded product, we need to find the point where the supply equals demand i.e., the point where $S(P)=D(P)$. 

Setting $S(P)$ equal to $D(P)$, 

$$\frac{1}{2} P+40=220-P$$

Simplifying the above expression by adding $P$ to both sides 

$$\frac{1}{2} P+P+40=220$$

$$\frac{3}{2}P=180$$

$$P=120$$

Therefore, the price at which the quantity of the product supplied to the market equals the quantity of the product demanded by the market is $\$120$.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
To find the price at which the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity of the product demanded, we need to find the price $P$ that makes $S(P) = D(P)$. That is, we need to solve the equation: $$\frac{1}{2}P+40=220-P.$$ Simplifying this equation yields $P=133$. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To find the price at which the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, we need to solve the equation $S(P)=D(P)$.

Question: $$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$In the equation above, $k$ is a constant. If $x=9$, what is the value of $k$ ?
Choices:
  A: 1
  B: 7
  C: 16
  D: 79
Response 0:
Squaring both sides of the equation $\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$ gives:

$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2-x^2=0^2 \Rightarrow k+2=x^2$$

Substituting $x=9$ yields:

$$k + 2 = 9^2 = 81 \Rightarrow k = 79$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
We can solve the equation for k by isolating the variable to one side and then squaring both sides. 

$$\begin{aligned} \sqrt{k+2}-x&=0 \\ \sqrt{k+2}&=x \\ k+2&=x^2 \\ k&=x^2-2 \end{aligned}$$

Substituting $x=9$ gives $k=9^2-2=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
To solve the equation, we have to isolate $k$.

Starting with:
$$\sqrt{k+2}-x=0$$

Adding $x$ to both sides:
$$\sqrt{k+2}=x$$

Squaring both sides:
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=x^2$$
$$k+2=x^2$$
$$k=x^2-2$$

Substituting $x=9$ in the above expression, we get:
$$k=9^2-2=79$$

Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
To solve the question, we need to isolate the $k$ variable. Squaring both sides of the equation will help: 

$$ \begin{aligned}\sqrt{k+2}-9 &= 0 \\ (\sqrt{k+2}-9)^2 &= 0^2 \\ k+2-18\sqrt{k+2}+81 &= 0 \\ k-16\sqrt{k+2}+83 &= 0  \end{aligned} $$

We can solve for the positive value of $k$ by factoring the quadratic on the left side of the equation using the quadratic formula. Or, we can see that the positive value of $k$ is:

$$ \begin{aligned} k &= \boxed{\textbf{(C) }16}   \end{aligned} $$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")   
Solution:  
$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$  
$\sqrt{k+2}=9$  
$k+2=81$    
$k=79$  
Therefore, the answer is (C) 16.
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we can simply substitute $x=9$ into the equation and solve for $k$
$$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$
$$\sqrt{k+2}=9$$
$$(\sqrt{k+2})^2=9^2$$
$$k+2=81$$
$$k=79$$
So the answer is:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Solving the equation, we have $$\sqrt{k+2}-9=0$$. 
Adding 9 to both sides and then squaring both sides, we have $k+2=81$.
Therefore, $k=79$. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
We know that $\sqrt{k+2}-x = 0$, so $\sqrt{k+2} = x$.
We also know that $x = 9$. 

Substituting $x=9$ into the equation $\sqrt{k+2} = x$, we get:
$\sqrt{k+2} = 9$

Squaring both sides of the equation, we have:
$k+2 = 81$

Subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation, we get:
$k = 79$

Therefore, the answer is:

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$.The speed of a sound wave in air depends on the air temperature. The formula above shows the relationship between $a$, the speed of a sound wave, in feet per second, and $t$, the air temperature, in degrees Fahrenheit $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$.
Question: At which of the following air temperatures will the speed of a sound wave be closest to 1,000 feet per second?
Choices:
  A: $-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  B: $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  C: $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
  D: $-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$
Response 0:
To solve this problem, we need to find which temperature will give a speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second. We can do this by calculating the speed of sound at each temperature and then finding which temperature gives a value closest to 1,000. The speed of sound at a temperature of $t$ degrees Fahrenheit is given by $a=1,052+1.08t$.
Plugging in the value of $t$ for each answer choice, we get:
A) $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-46) = 514.72$ feet per second
B) $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-48) = 506.56$ feet per second
C) $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-49) = 503.2$ feet per second
D) $a = 1,052 + 1.08(-50) = 499.84$ feet per second

So the closest value to 1,000 feet per second is 999, which is closest to the speed of sound at $-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we need to find the air temperature that gives a value of $a$ closest to 1,000. 

We can start by plugging in each answer choice for $t$ in the formula and calculating the corresponding value of $a$: 

- For $t=-46^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=995.32$
- For $t=-48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=992.56$
- For $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=991.17$
- For $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$, $a=989.78$

Hence, the answer is (C) $-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ since it gives the value closest to 1,000 feet per second.
Response 2:
The question asks for the temperature that produces a speed of sound closest to 1,000 feet per second. We can start by expressing the relationship between $a$ and $t$ as an equation solving for $t$ in terms of $a$ and then substituting $1,000$ feet per second for $a$ to find the corresponding temperature. Solving $$.a=1,052+1.08 t.$$ for $t$, we get $t=\frac{a-1,052}{1.08}$. Substituting $1,000$ feet per second for $a$, we get $t = \frac{1,000 - 1,052}{1.08} = -48.\overline{1}$. Since we want the temperature that produces a speed closest to 1,000 feet per second, the best choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ -48^{\circ} \mathrm{F}}$.

To solve the problem, we need to find the value of $t$ when $a \approx 1,000 .$ We can use estimation to find the answer. If $t=0,$ then $a=1,052,$ which is too large, so we need to try a negative $t .$ If $t=-50^{\circ} \mathrm{F},$ then $1,052+1.08 t=1,604$ which is too large. Continuing in that direction, we eventually find that $t=-49^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ gives $a=992.92,$ which is the closest to 1,000. Therefore, the answer is:

Response 0:
First, we will simplify the right-hand side of the equation:
$$2 a x-15=3(x+5)+5(x-1)$$
$$2 a x-15=3x+15+5x-5$$
$$2 a x-15=8x+10$$
$$2 a x=8x+25$$
$$x=\frac{4}{a}+\frac{25}{2 a^2}$$

Since no value of $x$ satisfies the equation, the right-hand side of the equation can never equal the left-hand side of the equation, regardless of the value of $a$. Therefore, no matter what value of $a$ we choose, the equation will never have a solution.

Question: The function $f$ is defined by $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$. The graph of $f$ in the $x y$-plane is a parabola. Which of the following intervals contains the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ ?
Choices:
  A: $-4<x<-3$
  B: $-3<x<1$
  C: $1<x<3$
  D: $3<x<4$
Response 0:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of $f$ is equal to $-\frac{b}{2a}$ where $a$ and $b$ are the coefficients of the quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$. Using the formula, we get $-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{(4)}{2(1)}=-2$. Thus, the answer is contained in the interval $A: -4<x<-3$.
Response 1:
Action: Answer("-2")  

The function is $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)=x^2+4x+3$. We can convert this quadratic function to vertex form, $f(x)=(x+2)^2-1$, by completing the square. The vertex is $(-2,-1)$. This $x$-coordinate is in between $-3$ and $-1$, so the answer is choice $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 2:
Action: Answer("-1") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2+bx+c$ gives by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$. So, here $f(x) = (x+3)(x+1) = x^2+4x+3$. Thus, $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $f$ is $x=-2$. This means that the answer is not any of the given intervals.
Response 3:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The vertex of the parabola with equation $y=ax^2+bx+c$ is located at $(x=-\frac{b}{2a}, y=c-\frac{b^2}{4a})$. So in this case, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$ is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-2$.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Action: Answer("-2") 

The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of a parabola in the form of $f(x)=(x-h)^2+k$ is $h$. We can rewrite $f$ as:
\begin{align*}
f(x)&=(x+3)(x+1)\\
&=x^2+4x+3\\
&=[(x+2)+1]^2-1\\
&=(x+2)^2+2.
\end{align*}
Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the parabola is $-2$, which is in interval A.
Response 6:
Action: Answer("-1")  
The $x$ coordinate of the vertex of a quadratic function $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$ is given by $x=-\dfrac{b}{2a}$. Applying this formula for $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we get $x=-\dfrac{(3+1)}{2}= -2$. Thus the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-2$, which is in interval $\boxed{\textbf{(B)} -3<x<1}$.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("-2")  

We can solve this question by completing the square, but one other easier way is to recognize that since the coefficient of the quadratic term is positive, the graph is a parabola that opens upward. Therefore, the vertex is the minimum point on the graph of $f$. By symmetry, the vertex is halfway between the roots of $f$. The roots are $\pm 3$ , and so the vertex occurs at the average of the roots, which is $x=-\frac{3+(-3)}{2}=-2$.
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Action: Answer("-2") 

To find the $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of the quadratic function $f(x)=(x+3)(x+1)$, we use the formula $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$, where $a$ is the coefficient of the squared term, and $b$ is the coefficient of the linear term. In this case, $a=1$ and $b=4$. Thus, the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $x=-\frac{b}{2a}=-\frac{4}{2}=-2$. Therefore, the answer is not one of the available intervals.

The results are summarized in the table above. If one of the surgeons is selected at random, which of the following is closest to the probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research?
Choices:
  A: 0.122
  B: 0.196
  C: 0.318
  D: 0.379
Response 0:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is the ratio of the number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activities are research to the total number of surgeons surveyed. Thus, the probability is: $$\frac{74}{607} \approx \frac{1}{8} = 0.125$$ The closest answer to this probability is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$.
Response 1:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is equal to the ratio: 

\[\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons whose major professional activity is research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}} = \frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122.\]

Therefore, the closest answer to the probability is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}.$
Response 2:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is: 

\begin{align*}
\frac{\text{Number of orthopedic surgeons conducting research}}{\text{Total number of surgeons}} &= \frac{74}{607} \\
&\approx 0.122
\end{align*}

Therefore, the closest answer is (A) 0.122. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research: $74/607.$

Probability that a surgeon selected at random is an orthopedic surgeon: $193/607.$

Probability that a surgeon selected at random is a researcher: $230/607.$

Therefore, the probability that a surgeon selected at random is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is approximately $\frac{74}{607} \div \frac{230}{607} = \frac{74}{230}\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B)}\ 0.196}.$
Response 4:
The total number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research is 74. The total number of all surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research is 230. Therefore, the probability that a surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is 74/230, which simplifies to approximately 0.3226, which is closest in value to 0.318. Thus, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.318. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
The probability required is the ratio of the number of orthopedic surgeons who indicated their major professional activity is research to the total number of surgeons i.e. $\frac{74}{607}$.  Simplifying, we get $\frac{74}{607}\approx\frac{1}{8}$ which is approximately $0.125$.
Closest to $0.125$ among the choices is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) }0.122}$. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research can be calculated by dividing the number of such surgeons by the total number of surgeons. From the given table, we see that there are 74 orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research, and the total number of surgeons is 607. 

So, the probability that a surgeon selected at random is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is $\frac{74}{607} \approx 0.122$, which is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } 0.122}$.
Response 7:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is calculated by dividing the number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research by the total number of surgeons. 

That is $\dfrac{74}{607}$ $\approx$ $\dfrac{1}{8}$ $\approx$ $0.125$. 

So the answer is closest to $\boxed{\textbf{(A)}\ 0.122}$.
Response 8:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is equal to the number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research divided by the total number of surgeons surveyed. 

Action: Answer(``B``)  

The number of orthopedic surgeons whose indicated professional activity is research is 74. 

So, the required probability is $\frac{74}{607}\approx 0.122$.
 
The closest value to  0.122 is  0.196, which is in choice $\textbf{(B)}$.
Response 9:
The probability that the selected surgeon is an orthopedic surgeon whose indicated professional activity is research is computed by dividing the number of orthopedic surgeons engaged in research by the total number of surgeons in the survey. Thus, 

$$\frac{74}{607}\approx 0.122$$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
We can solve the equation $20-x=15$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
20-x &= 15 \\
\Rightarrow \quad -x &= 15-20 \\
\Rightarrow \quad -x &= -5 \\
\Rightarrow \quad x &= 5.
\end{align*}
Now, we can find the value of $3x$ by substituting the value of $x$ that we just found:
\begin{align*}
3x &= 3\times 5 \\
&=15.
\end{align*}
Therefore, the answer is:

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("D")  
Solution: 

$20-x=15$

$-x = 15-20$

$x = -5$

$3x = 3\times(-5) = -15$

So the answer is D) 35.
Response 4:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To solve for the value of $x$, we can add $x$ to both sides of the equation: 

$20-x+x=15+x$

$20=15+x$

Next, we can isolate $x$ by subtracting $15$ from both sides:

$20-15=x$

$x=5$

Now that we know the value of $x$, we can find the value of $3x$ by multiplying $x$ by $3$:

$3x=3(5)=15$

The table shows the amount, in dollars, the company paid for each property and the corresponding monthly rental price, in dollars, the company charges for the property at each of the five locations. 23The relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, can be represented by a linear function. Which of the following functions represents the relationship?
Choices:
  A: $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
  B: $r(p)=5 p+165$
  C: $r(p)=6.5 p+440$
  D: $r(p)=7.5 p-10$
Response 0:
The solution can be found by comparing the ratio of the changes in rental price to the changes in purchase price from any pair of data points. Let's consider the purchase of Edgemont Street and Glenview Street. The rental price increased from 515 to 1,040, which is a change of $1040-515=525$ dollars. The purchase price increased from 70 to 140 thousand dollars, which is a change of $140-70=70$ thousand dollars. The ratio of the change in rental price to the change in purchase price is $525/70$, which simplifies to 7.5. This means that for every one thousand dollars increase in the purchase price, there is a $7.5 increase in monthly rental price. Therefore, a function representing this relationship can be written as:

$$r(p)=7.5p + k$$

where $p$ is the purchase price in thousands of dollars, and $k$ is a constant representing the monthly rental price when the property is purchased for \$0. We can solve for $k$ by using any one of the data points. Let's use the first data point, Clearwater Lane, where $p=128$. We have:

$$950=7.5(128)+k$$
$$k=-130$$

This means that the function representing the relationship between monthly rental price $r$ and purchase price $p$ is:

$$r(p)=7.5p -130$$

We can check that this relationship holds for the other data points as well. 

So, the answer is: Answer("D")
Response 1:
To find the correct answer, we need to use the formula for a linear function: $y = mx + b$ where $y$ is the dependent variable (monthly rental price) and $x$ is the independent variable (purchase price in thousands of dollars), $m$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept. To find the slope, we use the formula: $m = \frac{\text{change in } y}{\text{change in } x}$. For any two data points (purchase price, monthly rental price), the slope will be the same. We can choose two of the data points, for example, (128, 950) and (176, 1310), and find the slope:

$m = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

Now we need to find the y-intercept, which is the value of $r$ when $p = 0$. Looking at the answer choices, we can see that the only one whose y-intercept is close to the right order of magnitude is choice D:

$r(p) = 7.5 p - 10$

So the correct answer is:

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
The linear function is represented by the slope-intercept equation $r(p)=a p+b$ where $a$ is the slope and $b$ is the y-intercept (monthly rental with a property price of zero). We can calculate the slope using two points: $(128, 950)$ and $(450, 3365)$. The slope will be $a=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=\frac{2415}{322}=\frac{705}{94}$. Then, we can calculate the y-intercept using the point $(128, 950)$. The y-intercept is $b=r(p)-a p=950-\frac{705}{94}\cdot 128\approx -43.9362$. We can round it to -44. Thus, the linear function is $r(p)=\frac{705}{94} p -44$. 

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
To find the equation of the linear function, we need to find the equation of the line that passes through two points: $(128,950)$ and $(450,3365)$. 
The slope of the line can be found by:
$$\text{slope}=\frac{\text{rise}}{\text{run}}=\frac{3365-950}{450-128}=5$$
Thus, the function can be represented as:
$$r(p)=\text{slope}\cdot p+\text{y-intercept}=5p+b$$
where $b$ is the $y$-intercept. To find $b$, we can plug in one of the points:
$$950=5(128)+b$$
Solving for $b$, we get $b=-870$. Therefore, the function is:
$$r(p)=5p-870$$
Answer: Answer("A")
Response 4:
To find the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, and the property's purchase price $p$, we can use two points (that is, two properties). For example, we can use the properties Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive: 

- Clearwater Lane: $p = 128$ and $r = 950$
- Driftwood Drive: $p = 176$ and $r = 1310$

The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\frac{1310-950}{176-128}=6$. To find the $y$-intercept, we can use one of the points, for example Clearwater Lane:

$r=6p+b$
$950=6(128)+b$
$b=98$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $p$ and $r$ is:

$r(p)=6p+98$

To match the form of the choices, we can rewrite this as:

$r(p)=6.5p-27$

Therefore, the answer is (C) $r(p)=6.5 p+440$.
Response 5:
To find the relationship between $r$ and $p$, we need to determine the slope and y-intercept of the linear function. We can do this using two of the data points. Let's use Clearwater Lane and Driftwood Drive. 

For Clearwater Lane, we have $p=128$ and $r=950$. For Driftwood Drive, we have $p=176$ and $r=1310$. 

The slope of the function can be calculated as:

$m = \frac{\Delta r}{\Delta p} = \frac{1310-950}{176-128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$

To find the y-intercept, we can use one of the data points and the slope:

$r = mp + b$

$950 = 7.5(128) + b$

$b = 950 - 960 = -10$

Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between $r$ and $p$ is:

$r(p) = 7.5p - 10$

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
The best way to find the relationship is to use two of the points in the table to calculate the slope of the function and then use any of the points to calculate the $y$-intercept. For example, using the last two points in the table, we get: 

Slope $m = \dfrac{3365-1040}{450-140}= \dfrac{1325}{310}=4.2758 \approx 4.28$

Using point $(176, 1310)$ and slope $m=4.28$, we can now solve for the $y$-intercept with the slope-intercept form of a linear function $y=mx+b$: 

$y=4.28x+b \Rightarrow 1310=4.28(176)+b \Rightarrow b=440.48 \approx 440$

So the linear function that models the relationship between the monthly rental price $r(p)$ (in dollars) and the property's purchase price $p$ (in thousands of dollars) is:

$$r(p) = \boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 6.5p+440}$$
Response 7:
To find the linear function, we have to find the equation of the line that passes through two points. Let's choose two of the properties from the table, $(128,000, 950)$ and $(176,000, 1310)$, and find the equation of the line.

The slope of the line passing through these two points is:
$$m = \frac{\text{change in }r}{\text{change in }p} = \frac{1310 - 950}{176 - 128} = \frac{360}{48} = 7.5$$
The $y$-intercept of the line can be found by substituting the coordinates of one of the points and solving for $b$:
$$950 = 7.5 \cdot 128 + b \Rightarrow b = -10$$
So, the equation of the line is $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$, which is choice $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}}$.
Response 8:
The slope of a linear function represents the rate of change. If we let the purchase price be x and the monthly rental price be y, we can find the slope as follows:     

Slope $m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
    
Let's choose two properties from the table, for example, Hamilton Circle and Edgemont Street:

Slope $m=\dfrac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}=\dfrac{3365-515}{450-70}=\dfrac{2850}{380}=7.5$

So, the slope of the linear function is 7.5. We can use this slope and one of the points to find the y-intercept.

Let's use the point for Clearwater Lane: (128, 950)

We know that 
Monthly rental price $r$ in dollars = 7.5 * Purchase price $p$ in thousands of dollars + y-intercept

Using the point (128, 950) and 7.5 as the slope, we can solve for the y-intercept:

$950=7.5*128+y-intercept$   

$y-intercept=-760$

Therefore, Monthly rental price $r$ in dollars = 7.5 * Purchase price $p$ in thousands of dollars - 760

Answer: $\textbf{(A)}$ $r(p)=2.5 p-870$
Response 9:
The slope of a linear function is defined as the change in the value of the dependent variable (in this case, monthly rental price) divided by the change in the value of the independent variable (in this case, purchase price). The slope gives us the rate of change of the monthly rental price with respect to the purchase price. Looking at the table, we can find two points (purchase price, monthly rental price) that we can use to calculate the slope. Let's use the points (128, 950) and (176, 1310). We first convert the purchase prices into thousands of dollars (p), then we have:
\begin{align*}
\text{slope} &= \frac{\text{change in monthly rental price}}{\text{change in purchase price}} \\
&= \frac{1310-950}{176-128} \\
&= \frac{360}{48} \\
&= 7.5
\end{align*}
This means that for every increase of $1$ in $p$, the monthly rental price increases by $7.5$. To find the $y$-intercept (the value of $r(p)$ when $p=0$), we can use any point on the line and the slope we just found. Using the point $(70, 515)$, we have:
\begin{align*}
r(p) &= r(0) + 7.5p \\
515 &= r(0) + 7.5(70) \\
515 &= r(0) + 525 \\
r(0) &= -10
\end{align*}
Therefore, the linear function that represents the relationship between the monthly rental price $r$, in dollars, and the property's purchase price $p$, in thousands of dollars, is $r(p) = 7.5p - 10$.

Question: To make a bakery's signature chocolate muffins, a baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate for each muffin. How many pounds of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins?( 1 pound $=16$ ounces)
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 10
  C: 50.5
  D: 120
Response 0:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Solution:

To make one signature chocolate muffin the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate.

Therefore, to make 48 signature chocolate muffins, the total amount of chocolate required would be:

48 muffins $\times$ 2.5 ounces of chocolate per muffin $= 120$ ounces of chocolate

To convert ounces into pounds, we can divide the total amount of ounces by 16.

Therefore, the amount of chocolate required in pounds would be:

120 ounces of chocolate / 16 ounces per pound $= 7.5$ pounds of chocolate.

Answer: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
First, we need to find the total amount of chocolate in ounces needed to make 48 muffins. 
- 2.5 ounces/muffin * 48 muffins = 120 ounces
Then, we need to convert the ounces to pounds. 
- 120 ounces / 16 ounces/pound = 7.5 pounds

Therefore, the answer is A: 7.5. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
We are given that each muffin requires 2.5 ounces of chocolate and we need to make 48 muffins. 

Total chocolate required for 48 muffins $=$ 2.5 oz/muffin $\times$ 48 muffins 

Total chocolate required $= 120$ oz 

Now we need to convert ounces to pounds. 1 pound $=16$ ounces.

Total chocolate required $=\frac{120}{16}$ pounds $=7.5$ pounds

Answer: Option A, $7.5$.
Response 5:
Action: Answer("B")  
To make one muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. To make 48 muffins, the baker needs 2.5 * 48 = 120 ounces of chocolate. To convert ounces to pounds, we divide by 16, so 120 ounces of chocolate is 120/16 = 7.5 pounds of chocolate. Therefore, the answer is 10 (Choice B is correct).
Response 6:
First, we need to find out how many ounces of chocolate are needed to make 48 signature chocolate muffins. 

Action: Answer("2.5*48 = 120")

So, 120 ounces of chocolate are needed. 

Since 1 pound is equal to 16 ounces, we need to divide 120 by 16 to convert from ounces to pounds. 

Action: Answer("120/16 = 7.5")

Therefore, the answer is 7.5 pounds of chocolate. 

Thus, the answer is A: 7.5.
Response 7:
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Action: Answer("B")   
To make one signature chocolate muffin, the baker needs 2.5 ounces of chocolate. Thus, to make 48 muffins, the baker needs 48 x 2.5 = 120 ounces of chocolate. To convert this amount to pounds, we divide 120 by 16, which gives us 7.5 pounds of chocolate (120/16=7.5). Thus the answer is B) 10.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
We begin by setting $b=c:$ $$2.35+0.25x = 1.75+0.40x.$$ Solving for $x,$ we find $$x = 12.$$ We plug in $x=12$ for $b$ to get $$b = 2.35 + 0.25(12) = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}.$$ 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
To find out when the beef price equals the chicken price, we need to set $b=c$. So we have:$$
2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x
$$ Simplifying the equation above, we find that $x=12.5$. We can substitute $x=12.5$ back into equation for $b$ to find the price per pound of beef at that time:$$
b=2.35+0.25(12.5)=\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$3.35}
$$
Response 6:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
We are given that $b=c$, so we can substitute to get:
$$\begin{aligned}2.35+0.25x&=1.75+0.4x\\0.65&=0.15x\\x&=4.33\overline{3}\end{aligned}$$
Now we can substitute $x=4.33\overline{3}$ back into either of the original equations to find the price per pound of beef:
$$b=2.35+0.25(4.33\overline{3})=3.35$$
So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(D)}\ \$ 3.35}$.
Response 9:
To find the price per pound of beef when it was equal to the price per pound of chicken, we need to set $b$ equal to $c$ and solve for $x$. $$2.35+0.25x=1.75+0.40x$$ Simplifying this equation by subtracting 1.75 and 0.25x from both sides, we get:$$0.60x=0.60$$Dividing by 0.60, we get:$$x=1$$Now, we substitute $x=1$ into either equation to find the common price per pound. $$b=2.35+0.25(1) =2.60$$So the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A)} \$2.60}$.

Question: Survey Results\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}\hlineAnswer & Percent \\\hlineNever & $31.3 \%$ \\\hlineRarely & $24.3 \%$ \\\hlineOften & $13.5 \%$ \\\hlineAlways & $30.9 \%$ \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}The table above shows the results of a survey in which tablet users were asked how often they would watch video advertisements in order to access streaming content for free. Based on the table, which of the following is closest to the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never"?
Choices:
  A: 0.31
  B: 0.38
  C: 0.45
  D: 0.69
Response 0:
Let $P(A)$ denote the probability of a tablet user answering "Always" and $P(B)$ denote the probability of a tablet user not answering "Never." We can compute $P(A \mid B)$ using the formula $P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}.$

The event $A \cap B$ is the probability of a tablet user answering "Always" and not answering "Never." From the table, we see that the percentage of tablet users who answered "Always" is $30.9\%,$ and the percentage of tablet users who answered "Never" is $31.3\%.$ Therefore, the percentage of tablet users who did not answer "Never" is $100\% - 31.3\% = 68.7\%.$

Thus, we have:

$$P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} = \frac{30.9\%}{68.7\%} \approx 0.45,$$
so the closest answer choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 0.45}.$
Response 1:
Using the formula for conditional probability,\begin{align*} P(\text{"Always"}|\text{not "\Never" })&=\frac{P(\text{"Always"}\cap\text{not "\Never" })}{P(\text{not "\Never" })} \\&=\frac{0.309}{1-0.313}=\boxed{\textbf{(C) }0.45}. \end{align*}
Response 2:
Let $A$ represent the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ represent the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." We want to find $P(A|B),$ which is the probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." Using the formula for conditional probability, we have \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac{P(\text{Both } A\text{ and }B\text{ occurred})}{P(\text{ }B\text{ occurred})} \\
&= \frac{P(A)}{1-P(\text{"Never"})}.
\end{align*} Since $P(\text{"Never"}) = 0.313$ and $P(A)=0.309,$ we have $$P(A|B) = \frac{0.309}{1-0.313} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.$$
Response 3:
Let N be the event that the user answered "Never" and A be the event that the user answered "Always". 

We are looking for the conditional probability $P(A| \text{not } N)$. We can use Bayes Theorem:

$$ P(A| \text{not } N) = \frac{P(\text{not } N|A)P(A)}{P(\text{not } N|A)P(A) + P(\text{not } N|\text{not } A)P(\text{not } A)} $$

We can easily read off the values of $P(A) \approx 0.309$ and $P(\text{not } A) = 1 - P(A) \approx 0.691$ from the table. 

To find $P(\text{not } N|A)$, we use the complement rule: $P(\text{not } N|A) = 1 - P(N|A)$. 
From the table, we see that $P(N|A) = 0$. 

To find $P(\text{not } N|\text{not } A)$, we use the information given in the table: $P(\text{not } N|\text{not } A) = \frac{24.3 \% + 13.5 \%}{24.3 \% + 13.5 \% + 30.9 \%} \approx 0.54$.

Putting it all together, we have:

$$P(A| \text{not } N) = \frac{(1 - 0) \cdot 0.309}{(1 - 0) \cdot 0.309 + 0.54 \cdot (1-0.309)} \approx 0.38$$

So the closest answer choice is (B) 0.38. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Let $A$ be the event that a tablet user answered "Always" and let $B$ be the event that a tablet user did not answer "Never." Then we want to find $P(A|B).$

P(A \cap B) &= 30.9\% \\
P(B) &= 100\% - 31.3\% \\
&= 68.7\%.
\end{align*}

Therefore, \begin{align*}
P(A|B) &= \frac {P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} \\
&= \frac {30.9\%}{68.7\%} \\
&\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.
\end{align*}
Response 5:
Let $A$ be the event that a user watches the video advertisement "Always" and let $B$ be the event that the user does not choose "Never." We want to find $P(A|B).$ Using Bayes' Theorem, we get $$P(A|B)=\dfrac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}.$$ We know that $P(A)=0.309$ and that $P(Never)=0.313,$ so $P(B)=1-0.313=0.687.$ From the table, we see that $13.5 \%$ of users always watch, which means $$P(B|A)=\dfrac{\text{(Number of people who watch Always)}}{\text{(Total number of people)}}=\dfrac{30.9}{100}=0.309.$$ Plugging in the values, we get $$P(A|B)=\dfrac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}.$$
Response 6:
The probability that a tablet user answered "Always," given that the user did not answer "Never," can be calculated using conditional probability. Let A be the event that a user answered "Always" and B be the event that the user did not answer "Never". Then we want to find P(A | B).

Using Bayes' theorem, we have:

P(A | B) = P(B | A) * P(A) / P(B)

where P(B | A) is the probability that a user did not answer "Never" given that the user answered "Always." This probability is equal to 1, since if a user answered "Always," then the user definitely did not answer "Never."

P(A) is the probability that a user answered "Always," which is given in the table as 0.309.

P(B) is the probability that a user did not answer "Never." This probability is equal to 1 - P(Never), where P(Never) is the probability that a user answered "Never." This probability is given in the table as 0.313.

Therefore, we have:

P(A | B) = 1 * 0.309 / (1 - 0.313) 

P(A | B) = 0.309 / 0.687 

P(A | B) = 0.45 (approximately)

Answer: Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve this question, we need to use the concept of conditional probability. The probability of a tablet user answering "Always" given that the user did not answer "Never" is the probability of answering "Always" AND not answering "Never" divided by the probability of not answering "Never".  

Probability of answering "Always" AND not answering "Never" = 30.9%
Probability of not answering "Never" = 100% - 31.3% = 68.7%

Therefore, 
Probability of answering "Always" given that not answering "Never" = (30.9%)/(68.7%) which is approximately 0.45. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Let "N" be the event that the tablet user answered "Never" and "A" be the event that the tablet user answered "Always." 
We're asked to find $P(A| \text{not }N)$ or the probability that the tablet user answered "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never." 

Using Bayes' theorem, we know that 
$$P(A| \text{not }N) = \frac{P(\text{not }N|A)P(A)}{P(\text{not }N|A)P(A) + P(\text{not }N|\text{not }A)P(\text{not }A)}$$

We can use the table to find $P(A) = 0.309,~P(\text{not }N|A) = 1,~$ and $P(\text{not }N|\text{not }A) = 0.693.$
To find $P(\text{not }A),$ notice that it is the sum of the probabilities for the three categories other than "Always." Therefore, $P(\text{not }A) =  0.313 + 0.243 + 0.135 = 0.691.$

Substituting all these values, we get
$$P(A| \text{not }N) = \frac{1\times 0.309}{1\times 0.309 +  0.693\times 0.691} \approx \boxed{\textbf{(B) }0.38}$$
Response 9:
The probability of a tablet user answering "Always," given that the tablet user did not answer "Never" is equal to the probability of answering "Always" divided by the probability of not answering "Never." 

Let N represent the event that a tablet user answered "Never" and A represent the event that they answered "Always." We know that $P(N) = 0.313$ and $P(A) = 0.309.$ So, 

$P(A \mid \text{not } N) = \frac{P(A \cap \text{not } N)}{P(\text{not } N)} = \frac{P(A)}{1-P(N)}\approx 0.45$

Therefore, the closest answer choice is (C) 0.45.

Action: Answer("B")  
Solution: 

We can solve this system by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3 and then using elimination to solve for $x$:
$$\begin{aligned}& \quad\quad\,\, 4x-6y=-28, \\& -\left(9x-6y=-18\right). \end{aligned}$$

This gives us $-5x=-10$, and so $x=2$. Then, we can substitute $2$ for $x$ in either of the original equations to solve for $y$. Using the second equation, we get $3(2)-2y=-6$, which gives $y=6$.

Therefore, $x-y=2-6=\boxed{-4}$.
Response 2:

Response 3:
Action: Answer("B")  
Solution: 

To solve this system, begin by multiplying the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $2,$ yielding $$\begin{aligned}&-6 x+9 y=42 \\&6 x-4 y=-12\end{aligned}$$Adding these two equations gives $5 y=30,$ so $y=6.$. Substituting this value into either of the original equations gives $x=2 .$ Therefore,  $x-y=-8$  (because $x=2$ and $y=6$).
Response 4:
Action: Answer("B")  
Explanation: 

We can start by multiplying the first equation by $-3$ and the second equation by $-2$ to eliminate $y$. This gives us:

$$\begin{aligned} &-6x+9y=42 \\ &-6x+4y=12 \end{aligned} $$

Now we can subtract the second equation from the first:

$$\begin{aligned}  &5y = 30 \\ &y = 6 \end{aligned} $$

Substitute $y=6$ into one of the original equations:

$$2x-3(6)=-14$$

Solving for $x$, we get $x=1$.

Therefore, $x-y=1-6=-5$, which is not among the choices. However, if we reverse the sign, we get $x-y=-(-5)=\boxed{-8\text{ (Choice B)}}$ .

In this case, we have $m=\frac{1}{7}$ and $(x_1, y_1) = (0,0)$ since the line passes through the origin. Substituting those in the point-slope form, we get $y - 0 = \frac{1}{7}(x-0)$, which simplifies to $y=\frac{x}{7}$.

Now we can simply go through each of the answer choices and check which one satisfies the equation $y=\frac{x}{7}$:

A. $(0,7)$: $y=\frac{0}{7}=0$, not equal to $7$. This point does not lie on the line.
B. $(1,7)$: $y=\frac{1}{7} \cdot 1 = \frac{1}{7}$, not equal to $7$. This point does not lie on the line.
C. $(7,7)$: $y=\frac{1}{7} \cdot 7 =1$, which is equal to $7$. This point lies on the line.
D. $(14,2)$: $y=\frac{1}{7} \cdot 14 =2$, which is not equal to $2$. This point does not lie on the line.

Therefore, the point that lies on the line is C, $(7,7)$

### Temperature: 10.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Context: Jennifer bought a box of Crunchy Grain cereal. The nutrition facts on the box state that a serving size of the cereal is $\frac{3}{4}$ cup and provides 210 calories, 50 of which are calories from fat. In addition, each serving of the cereal provides 180 milligrams of potassium, which is $5 \%$ of the daily allowance for adults.
Question: On Tuesday, Jennifer will mix Crunchy Grain cereal with Super Grain cereal for her breakfast. Super Grain cereal provides 240 calories per cup. If the total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is 270, how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture?
Choices:
  A: $\frac{1}{8} \operatorname{cup}$
  B: $\frac{1}{4} \operatorname{cup}$
  C: $\frac{1}{3} \operatorname{cup}$
  D: $\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}$
Response 0:
Let's say Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. From Crunchy Grain cereal, $3$ cups provide $630$ calories. The number of calories from fat will be: $3 \cdot \frac{50}{4} = 38$. Hence, $3$ cups provide $210-38=172$ non-fat calories. 

To make one cup of the mixture, we can add $3/4$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal (210 calories) and $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal (240 calories per cup). We can create an equation based on the information given, which is: 

$210 + 240x = 270$

Solving this equation, we get:

$x=\frac{1}{3}$ cup. 

Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(C) } \frac{1}{3} \text{ cup}}$.
Response 1:
Let's assume $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal is mixed with a $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.
The total number of calories in $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is 210. Out of which, 50 calories are from fat. The remaining calories are from other sources. Therefore, calories from non-fat sources in $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $$(210-50) = 160.$$
The total number of calories in $1$ cup of the mixture is 270. We know that the number of calories from $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal is $240x.$ Therefore, we can model the problem with the following equation: $$240 x + 160 = 270.$$ Solving the above equation for $x$, we get $$x = \frac{1}{3}.$$ Thus, Jennifer mixes $\frac{1}{3}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $1$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of Jennifer's mixture.Then $1- x$ is the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of Jennifer's mixture. 

The total number of calories in one cup of Jennifer's mixture is $240x + 210(1-x)$, which is given to be 270. Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{1}{4}$.  

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Let the amount of Super Grain cereal be $x$ cups. 

Then, the amount of Crunchy Grain cereal is $1-x$ cups. 

The total number of calories in one cup of the mixture is $240x + 210\left(1-x\right) = 210+30x$.

We are given that this equals 270:

\begin{align*}
210+30x &= 270 \\
30x &= 60 \\
x &= 2.
\end{align*}

So, Jennifer used $2$ cups of Super Grain cereal.

To find out how much Super Grain cereal is in one cup of the mixture, we simply divide $2$ cups by the total number of cups, which is $1$ cup:

$$\frac{2 \operatorname{cups}}{1 \operatorname{cup}} = \boxed{\textbf{(D)}\:\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}$$
Response 4:
Let the amount of Super Grain cereal that Jennifer mixes in be represented by $x.$ We know that 1 cup of the mixture contains 270 total calories. 

The calories from Crunchy Grain cereal in 1 cup are: 

$$\frac{3}{4} \text{cup} \cdot \frac{210 \text{ calories}}{1 \text{ serving}} \cdot \frac{4}{3} = 280 \text{ calories}.$$ 

The calories from Super Grain cereal in 1 cup are:

$$x \text{ cup} \cdot \frac{240 \text{ calories}}{1 \text{ cup}} = 240x \text{ calories}.$$ 

Since the total number of calories in the mixture is 270, we have the equation $280 + 240x = 270.$ Solving for $x$ yields $x = \boxed{\textbf{(B) } \frac{1}{4} \text{cup}}.$
Response 5:
Let's assume that Jennifer mixes $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal with the Crunchy Grain cereal.
So, we have the equation: $210\left(\frac{4}{3}\right) + 240x = 270(1+x)$
Simplifying this equation, we get: $x = \frac{3}{8}$
Therefore, Jennifer mixes $\frac{3}{8}$ cups of Super Grain cereal with every  $\frac{3}{4}$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal.
Thus, to find out the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture, we need to find out the ratio between the amount of Super Grain cereal and the total amount of cereal in one cup of the mixture.
The total amount of cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{3}{4} + \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{8}$ cups.
So, the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{3}{8} \div \frac{9}{8} = \frac{1}{3}$ cup.
Therefore, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Let $x$ be the amount of Super Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture. In one cup of the mixture, Jennifer consumes $\frac{3}{4}-x$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. The total amount of calories in one cup of the mixture is $240x+210\left(\frac{3}{4}-x\right)=240x+157.5-210x=30x+157.5$. Setting this expression equal to 270 gives $30x+157.5=270$, which means $x=3.75$. Therefore, Jennifer mixes $3.75$ cups of Super Grain cereal with $0.75-3.75=-3$ cups of Crunchy Grain cereal. Jennifer cannot mix a negative quantity of Crunchy Grain cereal, which means the answer is $\boxed{\textbf{(A) } \frac{1}{8} \text{ cup}}$.
Response 7:
Let's assume that Jennifer uses $x$ cups of Super Grain cereal. The number of calories in this portion of the mixture will be $240x.$ 

From the information given, we know that $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal provides 210 calories, which is equivalent to $\frac{280}{3}$ calories. Thus, the number of calories provided by $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $\frac{280}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{280}{9}.$

For the mixture to have a total of 270 calories, we have the equation
$$ 240x + \frac{280}{9} = 270. $$

Solving for $x,$ we have
$$ x = \frac{9}{8} \cdot \frac{5}{3} = \frac{15}{8} \approx 1.88. $$

Therefore, Jennifer uses $\approx 1.88$ cups of Super Grain cereal for every $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal. To find the amount of Super Grain cereal needed for every cup of the mixture, we divide by $\frac{1}{4}$ cup:
$$ \frac{1.88}{1/4} = 7.52. $$

So the answer is approximately $7 \implies$ the best choice is $\boxed{\textbf{(D) }\frac{1}{2} \operatorname{cup}}.$
Response 8:
Let the amount of Super Grain cereal added be $x$ cups. 

The amount of Crunchy Grain cereal in one cup of the mixture is $\frac{270 - 240x}{210}$ cups. 

Thus, the total amount of potassium in one cup of the mixture is:
\[180 \cdot 5 \% + \frac{180}{210} \cdot \frac{270 - 240x}{\frac{3}{4}} \cdot 5 \% = 9 + \frac{2}{7}(270-240x)\]

We know the amount of potassium in one cup of the mixture is equal to the amount of potassium in one cup of Crunchy Grain (since Jennifer didn't add any potassium-rich foods), so we have:
\[\frac{2}{7}(270 - 240x) = 180 \cdot 5 \% = 9\]
Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{1}{3}$.

Therefore, Jennifer added $\frac{1}{3}$ cups of Super Grain cereal.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Let $x$ be the number of cups of the Super Grain cereal. The number of calories in $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal is $210$ and the number of calories in $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal is $60$. Therefore, the number of calories in one cup of the mixture is 
\[210 + 60x = 270.\]
Solving this equation gives $x = \frac{1}{4}$. Therefore, Jennifer must mix $\frac{1}{4}$ cup of Super Grain cereal with $\frac{3}{4}$ cup of Crunchy Grain cereal.

Question: $$-2 x+3 y=6$$In the $x y$-plane, the graph of which of the following equations is perpendicular to the graph of the equation above?
Choices:
  A: $3 x+2 y=6$
  B: $3 x+4 y=6$
  C: $2 x+4 y=6$
  D: $2 x+6 y=3$
Response 0:
To determine which of the given equations is perpendicular to the given equation, we need to find the slope of the given equation first, and then the slope of each of the given equations. The equation of a line perpendicular to the given line will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given line. 

From the given equation, we can rearrange it to slope-intercept form:
$$y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$$
Therefore, the slope of the given equation is $\frac{2}{3}$. 

(A) $3x+2y=6$ can be rearranged to $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

(B) $3x+4y=6$ can be rearranged to $y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{3}{4}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation.

(C) $2x+4y=6$ can be rearranged to $y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{2}$, which is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the given equation. Therefore, this line is perpendicular to the given equation. 

(D) $2x+6y=3$ can be rearranged to $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. The slope of this line is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so it is not perpendicular to the given equation. 

Thus, the answer is: 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
To solve this problem, we can determine that two lines are perpendicular if the product of their slopes is -1. Therefore, we need to rearrange the equation given to find its slope. $$-2 x+3 y=6$$ $$3 y = 2x + 6$$ $$y = \frac{2}{3}x + 2$$ The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$. 
Then for each of the given equations, we can rearrange them to find their slopes and check if the product of their slopes is -1. 

Action: Answer("D") 

Working:
$$3 x+2 y=6 , y = -\frac{3}{2}x+3, m=-\frac{3}{2}$$
$$3 x+4 y=6 , y = -\frac{3}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}, m=-\frac{3}{2}$$
$$2 x+4 y=6, y = -\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}, m=-\frac{1}{2}$$
$$2 x+6 y=3, y = -\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}, m=-\frac{1}{3}$$
So only the equation of (D) has a slope that is negative reciprocal of the slope of the equation given. Therefore, the answer is (D) $2 x+6 y=3$.
Response 2:
To find an equation that is perpendicular to $$-2x+3y=6$$, we need to recognize that its slope is $2/3$. The slope of a line perpendicular to this line will have a slope that is negative reciprocal, i.e. $-3/2$. The only equation that has this slope is:

$$\text{Action: Answer("C") } $$
Response 3:
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
To determine which line is perpendicular, we need to find the slope of the given line. Rearranging the equation into slope-intercept form, we get $$y = \frac{2}{3} x + 2.$$ So the slope of the given line is $\frac{2}{3}.$
The line that is perpendicular to this has a slope that is the negative inverse of this. Thus, we want the line with a slope of $-\frac{3}{2}.$ 
Solving for $y$ in each of the answer choices, we see that the only line with this slope is: $$\boxed{\textbf{(C) }2x+4y=6}.$$
Response 5:
With the given equation, we can rearrange it into slope-intercept form, $y=\frac{2}{3}x+2$. The slope of this line is $\frac{2}{3}$.

Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the product of their slopes is $-1$. So, to find the equation that is perpendicular to the given line, we need to find an equation with slope $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Let's check the slopes of each of the choices:

Choice A: $3 x+2 y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{2}$, so this could be perpendicular to the given equation.
Choice B: $3 x+4 y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{3}{4}x+\frac{3}{4}$. The slope is $-\frac{3}{4}$, so this is not perpendicular to the given equation.
Choice C: $2 x+4 y=6 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{3}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{2}$, so this is not perpendicular to the given equation.
Choice D: $2 x+6 y=3 \Rightarrow y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. The slope is $-\frac{1}{3}$, so this could be perpendicular to the given equation.

So, the possible choices are A and D. To check which is correct, we can plug in some values to see if they are actually perpendicular. For example, we can use $x=3$ and $y=0$, which satisfy the equation $-2x+3y=6$ to get the point $(3,0)$. Then, we can check the slopes of the lines passing through this point with slopes $\frac{2}{3}$ and $-\frac{3}{2}$.

Choice A: $y=-\frac{3}{2}x+3$. Passing through $(3,0)$, we get $y=-\frac{3}{2}(3)+3=-\frac{3}{2}$, so the slope is indeed $-\frac{3}{2}$, making this choice perpendicular to the given equation.
Choice D: $y=-\frac{1}{3}x+\frac{1}{2}$. Passing through $(3,0)$, we get $y=-\frac{1}{3}(3)+\frac{1}{2}=-\frac{1}{2}$, so the slope is not $-\frac{3}{2}$, making this choice not perpendicular to the given equation.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. 

Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
To find the equation that is perpendicular to  $-2 x+3 y=6$, we want to think about the slope of the given line which is $2/3$. The slope of a line that is perpendicular would be the negative reciprocal of this, which is $-3/2$. We can now check which of the equations has a slope of $-3/2$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
To solve the problem, we need to convert the given equation into slope-intercept form, $y = mx + b$. Solving for $y$ gives $y = (2/3)x + 2$. Thus, the slope of the given line is $2/3$.

A line that is perpendicular to the given line has a slope that is the negative reciprocal of $2/3$. That is, it has a slope of $-3/2$. The only line with this slope in the given equations is $\boxed{\mathrm{(C)}\ 2x+4y=6}$.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
To solve the problem, we need to find the slopes of the given line, and the slopes of lines perpendicular to it. In order to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be equal to -1. 

The given equation in slope-intercept form is $\frac{3}{2}y + \frac{1}{2} x = 3$. So its slope is $-\frac{1}{\frac{3}{2}} = -\frac{2}{3}$. 

Thus, the slope we seek must be $\frac{3}{2}$. So we need to find the equation of a line with that slope and a different $y$-intercept. 

Checking each of the answer choices for a slope of $\frac{3}{2}$, we find that only $\boxed{\textbf{(C)}\ 2x+4y=6}$ gives the correct slope.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  The first step is to make sure the expectations are age-appropriate.
  The next step should be related to the first step.
  Option A talks about knowing the child's goals before setting an expectation, which is not related to the first step.
  Option B talks about providing an example of how expectations can change with age, which is not a step to set expectations.
  Option C talks about doing research to learn about milestones and evaluating whether expectations are realistic, which is a logical next step after making sure expectations are age-appropriate.
  Option D talks about children becoming more independent, which is not related to setting expectations.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.

  The text is discussing how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The first step is to ensure that the expectations are age-appropriate.
  The second sentence explains that children develop at their own pace.
  The third sentence mentions that there are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for what a child might be expected to do.
  The fourth sentence explains that there is no guarantee that a child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
  The most likely completion to this text would be a step or substeps that provide further guidance on how to set age-appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public.
  Choice A is not a likely completion because it suggests adjusting expectations rather than setting age-appropriate expectations.
  Choice B is not a likely completion because it discusses telling a child about their past behavior, which is not directly related to setting expectations for their behavior in public.
  Choice C is a likely completion because it suggests doing research to learn about developmental milestones and evaluating whether expectations are realistic based on the child's age and typical behavior.
  Choice D is not a likely completion because it discusses children becoming more independent and gaining maturity, which is not directly related to setting expectations for their behavior in public.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  The player is trying to hit a goal.
  The question is asking what the player's teammate is most likely doing.
  Option A does not make sense because it mentions a "sumo" making a goal.

  Option D does not make sense because it says the player is called a loser, which is unlikely to happen in a team sport.
  Option C is the most likely completion because the player's teammate would probably try to help keep the ball away from the opponent team player.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

  The most likely completion to the text is a substep that provides additional information on how to apply the eyeliner.
  Choice A is not a likely completion because it does not provide additional information on how to apply the eyeliner.
  Choice B is not a likely completion because it does not mention anything about using a light-colored eyeliner or how it can help small round eyes look bigger.
  Choice D is not a likely completion because it provides incorrect information about only using white eyeliner for brown eyes.
  Choice C is a likely completion because it provides additional information on how to apply the eyeliner by suggesting to apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look and to avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  Therefore, the answer is C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

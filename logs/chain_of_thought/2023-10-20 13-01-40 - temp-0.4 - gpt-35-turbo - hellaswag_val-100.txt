Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  Option D suggests that the fire rapidly spreads across the ground, which is not consistent with a controlled campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Choice A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a likely scenario.
  Choice B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is possible but less likely since the text already says the fire is burning brightly.
  Choice C describes a process for lighting and putting out a fire, but it does not fit with the context of the text.
  Choice D describes a fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not only unlikely but also dangerous.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the next sentence will describe the fire itself.
  Option A seems to be the most likely completion as it describes the fire "dancing" and people watching it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the completion should describe what the fire is doing or what is happening to it.
  Option A seems to be the most fitting as it describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame.
  Option B could be a possibility, but the text already states that the fire is burning brightly, so it is unlikely that it is slowly growing in size.
  Option C seems unlikely since it describes a process for lighting and putting out a fire, but the text already describes a fire that is burning.
  Option D is unlikely since it suggests that the fire is spreading rapidly across the ground, which is dangerous and not desirable in a campfire.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that a campfire is burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" suggests that the fire is already burning at a good size.
  The next sentence should describe what is happening with the fire.
  Option A suggests that the fire is dancing and people are watching it flame, which is a likely scenario.
  Option B suggests that the fire is slowly growing in size, which is less likely since the first sentence implies that the fire is already burning brightly.
  Option C suggests that the fire is being lit from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill, which is not a logical completion to the sentence.
  Option D suggests that the fire is rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a logical completion to the sentence either.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a likely scenario.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also possible but less likely than option A.
  Option C describes how to light and put out a campfire, but it does not complete the sentence.
  Option D describes a dangerous scenario where the fire rapidly spreads across the ground, which is not likely in this context.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already well-established.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that we are continuing to describe the fire that has already been established.
  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely completion to the text, as it describes a common activity around a campfire.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text.
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the fire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a likely and common occurrence around a campfire.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also a possibility, but not as likely as option A.
  Option C describes a specific method of lighting and putting out a fire, but it doesn't fit well with the context of the given text.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not likely and goes against fire safety rules.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The second sentence should be a continuation of the description of the campfire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a reasonable continuation of the description.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is not a continuation of the description.
  Option C describes lighting the fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill, which is not a continuation of the description.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not a continuation of the description.

  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The sentence "scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response." makes sense and fits well with the celebratory response mentioned in the previous sentence.
  Option A does not make sense because the yellow team has just earned another goal and is celebrating.
  Option C does not make sense because it contradicts the celebratory response mentioned in the previous sentence.
  Option D does not make sense because it does not provide a logical completion to the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The yellow team has earned another goal and is celebrating.
  The text suggests that the game is not over yet.
  Option A suggests that the yellow team loses a goal and walks away, which contradicts the fact that they are celebrating.
  Option B suggests that the yellow team scores one final goal and hugs each other in response, which is a possible completion of the text.
  Option C suggests that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth, which does not make sense in the context.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response.
  This indicates that the yellow team has scored another goal and is celebrating.
  The text then describes how the yellow team members are congratulating each other.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:

  Therefore, the yellow team will likely continue playing.
  The most likely completion is that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The sentence "scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response" is a likely completion to the text.
  This completion fits with the celebratory response that the yellow team had after scoring the second goal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The celebratory response suggests that the game is not over yet.
  The options A and D do not make sense.

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates.
  The text implies that the game is still ongoing.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The second sentence describes him lifting weights over his head.
  The third sentence starts with "sometimes he", which implies that there are different outcomes.
  The fourth sentence describes two different outcomes: failing or being successful.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weight over his head several times.
  The question asks what happens after he lifts the weight over his head.
  Option A, "lifts so far he is dragged to the ground" seems unlikely and not mentioned in the text.
  Option B, "put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it" is not consistent with the text. It says "Several times he picks up weight and lifts it over his head".
  Option C, "lowers his arms and his hands up" is not consistent with the text. It says "he picks up weight and lifts it over his head".
  Option D, "fails, other times he is successful" is consistent with the text. It says "Several times, he picks up weight and lifts it over his head". This implies that he is successful some times and fails other times.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "fails, other times he is successful."
  The answer is D: fails, other times he is successful. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weights and lifts them over his head several times.
  The options are:
    A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground. - This does not seem likely as it is dangerous and not a common occurrence.
    B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it. - This does not seem likely as the man is training for the Olympics and would not waste time showing off to his friends.
    C: lowers his arms and his hands up. - This does not seem likely as it is not a complete sentence and does not make sense.
    D: fails, other times he is successful. - This seems like the most likely option as weightlifting requires a lot of practice and effort, and it is common to fail at times before succeeding.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The man shows a video of himself training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  Several times, he picks up weight and lifts it over his head.
  The options are:
    A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
    B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
    C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
    D: fails, other times he is successful.
  None of the options seem to fit the context of the text.
  However, option D seems to be the most likely completion as it suggests that the man was both successful and unsuccessful at times.

  The next sentence should describe what others are doing.
  Option A describes others capturing fish, but it does not make sense because it is the person reeling in the fish.
  Option B describes others in the water, but it does not make sense because it is the person reeling in the fish.
  Option D describes others watching a calf, but it does not make sense because it is the person reeling in the fish.
  Option C describes others kneeling around him, which makes sense because they could be helping him or watching him reel in the fish.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text mentions "others" which implies that there are other people present.
  Option A is unlikely because it says "capturing the fish that he has captured" which is redundant.
  Option B is unlikely because it doesn't make sense for people to be "mostly off in the water" while fishing.
  Option D is unlikely because it mentions a calf which is not related to the fishing activity.
  Option C is the most likely because it mentions people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the fishing pole.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole being reeled in by a person.
  The text mentions "others".
  The most likely completion to the text is a description of what the "others" are doing.
  Option A describes others capturing fish, which is possible, but not necessarily the most likely completion.
  Option B describes others in the water, which is not consistent with the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  Option D describes others watching a calf, which is not related to the fishing pole or the person reeling it in.
  Option C describes others kneeling around the person reeling, which is consistent with the image of a group of people fishing together.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole being reeled in.
  The options describe what other people are doing in the scene.
  Option A says others are capturing fish in the area, but there is no mention of this in the text.
  Option B says others are mostly off in the water, but this contradicts the fact that the text only describes a close-up of a fishing pole being reeled in.
  Option D says others are watching a calf being released, but this is not related to the fishing scene described in the text.
  Option C says others are kneeling around the person as he continues to reel, which makes sense as they might be helping or observing.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that others are kneeling around him as he continues to reel.
  The answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The text also mentions "others".
  The most likely scenario is that the "others" are helping the person reel in the fish or are watching him.
  Option A is possible, but it is unlikely that "others" would be capturing fish at the same time.
  Option B does not make sense since it mentions people being in the water and reeling the fishing pole in, which is not possible.
  Option D does not make sense since it mentions people watching a calf being released, which is not related to the fishing activity.
  Option C is the most likely completion since it describes people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the fish.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

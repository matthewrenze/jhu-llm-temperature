[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly by clapping their backs and shaking hands.
  The celebratory response implies that the game is not over yet.
  The text mentions that the yellow team "earns another goal", which means they are playing well.
  Therefore, it is likely that they will score another goal and continue playing.
  The answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text talks about the yellow team earning another goal and celebrating briefly.
  The text then introduces a new event that happens after the goal is scored.
  The celebration is described as clapping each other's backs.
  The most likely completion to the text is a description of what happens after the celebration.
  Option A talks about the yellow team losing a goal and walking away, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option C talks about the yellow team continuing to score goals, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option D talks about marking the match, which is not related to the events in the text.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates by briefly shaking hands with each other and clapping their backs.
  This suggests that the yellow team has scored another goal and is winning the game.
  The celebratory response is not likely to be a response to losing a goal.
  The text suggests that the game is still ongoing, so it is not likely that the yellow team has scored the final goal.
  The text does not suggest that the yellow team is doing the same thing back and forth.
  The text does not suggest that the person speaking needs to mark the match.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  The yellow team celebrates briefly with each other.
  The most likely completion to the text should describe what happens next in the game.
  Option A doesn't make sense as it contradicts the information provided in the text.
  Option C is unlikely as it suggests that the yellow team continues to score goals without any opposition.
  Option D is not related to the information provided in the text.
  Option B is the most likely completion to the text as it suggests that the yellow team scores one final goal and celebrates by hugging each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response.
  This indicates that the yellow team has scored a goal and is celebrating.
  The sentence ends with "the yellow team", which may suggest that the sentence is incomplete.
  The next sentence should logically follow the first sentence.
  "loses one goal and he walks away" does not fit the celebratory context of the first sentence.
  "scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response" is a possible completion that fits the celebratory context of the first sentence.
  "continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth" does not fit the celebratory context of the first sentence.
  "better mark the match while they're still scoring" does not fit the celebratory context of the first sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The phrase "shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response" implies a positive reaction to the goal.
  The phrase "scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response" seems like a logical completion to the text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly by clapping their backs and shaking hands with each other.
  The text implies that the game is still ongoing.
  The options A and D do not make sense in the context of the text.

  The option B is the most likely completion as it fits with the celebratory response of the yellow team.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The text suggests that the game is still ongoing.
  Therefore, the yellow team most likely continues playing after celebrating their goal.
  The answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates with each other.
  The celebration involves clapping each other's backs.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The text mentions that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The phrase "the woman on the back of the camel" suggests that one woman is sitting behind the other.
  Since the text does not mention any movement or action, it is most likely that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something stationary.
  Looking at her phone or waving at the camera are both possible stationary actions.
  However, since the text does not mention a camera, it is more likely that the woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone.

Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.

  Option B doesn't make sense because it describes people mostly off in the water, but the text only describes a close-up of a fishing pole being reeled in.
  Option D doesn't make sense because it describes people watching a calf being released, but there is no mention of a calf or any other animal in the text.

Thought:
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole with a person reeling it in.

  Choice B describes others mostly off in the water, which does not make sense.
  Choice C says that others are kneeling around him, which is the most likely scenario as they could be helping or watching him.

  Option D does not make sense because it says "watching a calf as it is released", which is not related to the fishing pole.

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

### Temperature: 6.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.

  Therefore, the fire is already lit and it is not being started.
  The correct completion should describe what is happening with the already burning fire.
  Option A talks about people watching the fire flame which is likely.
  B and C talk about starting and putting out a fire respectively, which is not appropriate here.
  D talks about the fire spreading across the ground which is not happening here.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the given text.
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens with the fire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a likely scenario for a campfire.
  Option B describes the fire slowly growing in size, which is also possible but not as likely as option A.
  Option C describes lighting the fire from the inside up and putting it out behind an iron grill, which is not a completion to the given text.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not likely and also not a completion to the given text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The incomplete sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" suggests that the fire is already burning at a good size.
  Option A describes people watching the fire, which is a common activity around a campfire.
  Option B suggests that the fire is growing, but there's no indication in the sentence that it's still increasing in size.
  Option C sounds like instructions for how to start and put out a campfire, but it doesn't complete the sentence in a way that makes sense.
  Option D describes a dangerous situation that is unlikely to happen in a controlled campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that the campfire is burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" suggests that the fire is already burning and well-established.
  The other options are unlikely because they describe the process of starting a fire, not a fire that is already burning.
  The most likely completion to the sentence is that the fire "dances and people watch it flame."
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence already says that "A camp fire burns brightly in the night."
  The next sentence should be a continuation of the description of the fire.
  Option A seems to be a likely description of what happens around a campfire.
  Option B could be a possible continuation as well, but the word "slowly" doesn't seem to match the initial description of the fire burning brightly.
  Option C doesn't seem to fit the context of the sentence and seems to describe a different scenario.
  Option D is unlikely and dangerous, as a fire that rapidly spreads across the ground is not safe for a campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is option A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The first sentence describes a camp fire burning brightly in the night.
  The second sentence should describe what happens next.
  A camp fire does not typically grow slowly or rapidly spread across the ground.
  The fire does not need to be lit from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a likely continuation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text mentions that "A camp fire burns brightly in the night."
  The next sentence should describe what the fire is doing.
  Option A describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame which is a likely activity around a campfire.
  Option B describes the fire growing in size, which could also be a possibility, but it doesn't necessarily fit with the context of the previous sentence.
  Option C describes a specific method of lighting and putting out a campfire, but it doesn't flow well with the previous sentence.
  Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, which is not safe or responsible campfire behavior.
  Therefore, the best answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  A campfire is a controlled fire.
  The phrase "burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" is incomplete without a verb.
  The verb should describe a characteristic of the fire.
  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely completion as it describes the movement of the fire and the activity of people around it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that "a campfire burns brightly in the night."
  The word "burns" suggests that the fire is already lit.
  None of the choices mention lighting a fire, so the fire must already be burning.
  Choice A describes the fire dancing, which is a common way to describe the movement of flames.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.

  The text says that the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates it by shaking hands briefly and clapping their backs.
  The text suggests that the yellow team is winning.
  The options A and D do not fit the context of the text.
  The option C suggests that the yellow team continues to score; however, it does not suggest that they celebrate after scoring.

  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates by clapping each other's backs.
  This is a celebratory response, so it is likely that they won the game.
  The choices A and D do not fit the celebratory response and do not make sense.
  The choice C suggests that they continue playing and scoring, but it doesn't fit with the celebratory response. 
  The most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")

  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal and celebrating with brief handshakes and back claps.
  The text then sets up an expectation for what will happen next.
  The most likely completion is that the game will continue.

  Therefore, the answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly.
  The celebratory response could be a hug or a clap on the back.
  The celebration is not likely to be an indication that the game is over.
  The celebratory response is likely to be an indication of a goal being scored.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text states that the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly.
  The celebratory response is described as "clapping their backs".
  The text does not suggest that the game has ended.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team continues playing.
  The answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The sentence says "the yellow team", but the question asks what happens next, so we need to find the most likely completion to the text.
  Option A doesn't make sense because it contradicts the sentence about the yellow team earning another goal.
  Option C doesn't make sense because it seems to describe the same thing happening over and over again.
  Option D is not related to what happens next in the game.
  Option B is the only option that makes sense because it describes the yellow team scoring one final goal and then hugging each other in response.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal and celebrating briefly.
  The celebration includes clapping each other's backs.
  The text does not mention anything about the game ending or players walking away.
  The celebration seems to suggest the game is not over yet.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
  The answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The celebration seems to indicate that the game is not over yet.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the game continues.
  Choice C suggests that the yellow team continues playing and scores another goal.
  Therefore, the answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The passage describes a yellow team earning another goal and celebrating.
  The celebratory response is described as shaking hands briefly with each other and clapping each other's backs.
  The passage does not suggest that the game is over, but rather that the yellow team continues playing.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
  The answer is C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  The yellow team members shake hands briefly with each other and clap their backs. This suggests that they are celebrating.
  To complete the text, we need to choose the option that describes what happens after the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly.
  Option A suggests that the yellow team loses a goal and walks away, which does not fit with the celebratory response.
  Option C suggests that the yellow team continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth. This option is unlikely as it suggests the game is repetitive and does not progress.
  Option D does not make sense in the context of the text.
  Option B describes the yellow team scoring one final goal, at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response. This option is likely as it fits with the celebratory response described in the text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.

Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

Choices:
  A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
  B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  C: waves at the camera.
  D: is running and with other people walking alongside it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The text then specifies that one of the women is on the back of the camel.
  Since the text is not describing any movement or action, it is unlikely that the woman on the back of the camel is running.
  The text does not mention any other people or a camera, so it is unlikely that there are other people or a camera present.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is waving at the camera.
  The answer is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

    A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
    B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
    C: waves at the camera.
    D: is running and with other people walking alongside it.
  Option A doesn't make sense because it's unlikely that two women would be holding the camel down.
  Option B could be possible, but it doesn't make it clear what "knee to knee" means in this context.
  Option C seems like a common pose when taking a photo while riding a camel.
  Option D doesn't make sense because it describes a different scenario.
  Therefore, the answer is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The description then focuses on the woman on the back of the camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is not holding the camel down, so we can eliminate option A.
  There is no mention of the woman on the back of the camel starting to run, so we can eliminate option D.
  The woman on the back of the camel is not holding anything, so we can eliminate option C.
  The only option remaining is B, which describes the position of the woman on the back of the camel.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: The text describes two women sitting on a small camel. The next sentence starts with "the woman on the back of the camel", suggesting that the question is asking about the woman on the back of the camel. 
  Option A suggests that the woman on the back of the camel is looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down. This is unlikely as it would be difficult for two women to hold down a camel while it is moving. 
  Option B suggests that the woman on the back of the camel is sitting knee to knee with the woman on the front. This is possible, but it doesn't provide any additional information about the situation. 
  Option C suggests that the woman on the back of the camel is waving at the camera. This is the most likely completion as it is common for people to take photos of themselves while riding camels. 
  Option D suggests that the woman on the back of the camel is running with other people walking alongside it. This is unlikely as it is difficult to run while sitting on a camel.

  Choice A seems unlikely because it doesn't make sense that two women would need to hold the camel down.
  Choice C is possible, as people often wave at cameras when taking pictures.
  Choice D is unlikely because it describes the camel running with other people walking alongside it, which is not mentioned in the text.

  Option C could be a possibility, but there's no mention of a camera earlier in the text, and it's not clear why the woman would be waving.
  Option D doesn't fit the context of the sentence. It mentions running and other people walking alongside, which doesn't seem to fit the description of the two women sitting on the camel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the woman on the back of the camel is holding on to the woman on the front of the camel, knee to knee.
  The answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front. 
Action: Answer("B")

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize fear in dogs [title] Look for the whites in a dog's eyes. [step] A dog who's tense or fearful may widen its eyes so that they appear rounder than normal. A relaxed dog often squints so that the eyes become almond-shaped with hardly any whites showing at all.
Choices:
  A: [substeps] Some dogs may appear biting during relaxation or hiding from the thought of biting. The deweye dog flashes white teeth at the sight of blood, while another who exhibits an attacking psychological response may flinch or contort their faces into a fearful stare.
  B: The whites of a dog's eyes may look milky, gray, or bloodshot, or very pale. [substeps] A calm dog generally relaxes when frightened or depressed, and may not retreat from fearful moments.
  C: [substeps] Another characteristic of dogs that are tense or fearful is their pupils. The pupils normally dilate when they are calm or frightened.
  D: If you can see lots of white around a dog's eyes, the dog may be afraid or tense. [substeps] Dilated pupils can also occur when a dog has its eyes widened and is another sign of fear or arousal.

  The text describes a player from the blue team aggressively chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The sentence ends with "his team member", which suggests that the player's teammate is about to do something related to the play.
  Option A describes a teammate passing to another teammate, who scores a goal and the blue team celebrates.
  Option B describes the player spinning and missing the goal by two feet, which is not a positive outcome.
  Option C describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent, which is a possibility but not a completion of the sentence.
  Option D describes the player failing and being called a loser, which is not a positive outcome.
  Therefore, option A is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball and trying to hit a goal.
  The sentence ends abruptly with "his team member."
  None of the choices seem to fit the context of the sentence.
  "Sumo" doesn't seem to fit the context of the sentence.
  "Spins quickly to evade the ball" doesn't make sense because the player is trying to hit the ball towards the goal.
  "Tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player" doesn't fit the context of the player trying to hit a goal.
  "Fails the first time and he is called a loser" is not a likely outcome and seems inappropriate.
  None of the choices seem to fit the context of the sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a player from the blue team aggressively chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The sentence ends with "his team member". This means that the player's teammate is going to do something related to the ball and the goal.
  Option A talks about a sumo making a goal, which is unlikely in a lacrosse game.
  Option B talks about the player missing the goal by two feet, which is possible but not related to the teammate mentioned in the sentence.
  Option C talks about the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is possible but not related to the teammate mentioned in the sentence.
  Option D talks about the player failing and being called a loser, which is not only unlikely but also inappropriate in a team sport.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the player's teammate makes a goal.
  The answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team is trying to hit a goal, which means he is most likely close to the goalpost.
  The text mentions a team member, which indicates that the player might pass the ball to his teammate.
  Option A mentions that a teammate receives the pass, scores a goal, and the blue team celebrates, which is the most likely completion.
  Option B mentions that the player spins to evade the ball and misses the goal, which is not related to the text.
  Option C mentions that the player tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is not related to the text.
  Option D mentions that the player fails and is called a loser, which is not related to the text.
  Therefore, the answer is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that a player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which indicates that the sentence will likely describe an action taken by the player's teammate.
  Option A describes a successful pass and goal, but there is no mention of the original player's success or failure.
  Option B describes the player missing the goal, but there is no mention of the teammate's action.
  Option D is not a likely completion as it is negative and does not describe any action by the teammate.
  Option C is the most likely completion as it describes the player's teammate trying to help by following the ball and keeping it away from the opponent team player.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is trying to hit a goal with his lacrosse stick.
  The text mentions "his team member", so it is likely that the player's teammate is involved in some way.
  Option A does not make sense because it mentions a "sumo", which is not related to lacrosse.
  Option B is a possibility, but it does not involve the player's teammate.
  Option D is unlikely because it is not a positive outcome and does not fit with the overall tone of the text.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it involves the player following the ball and keeping it away from the opponent team player, which is a common strategy in lacrosse.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team aggressively chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The text then refers to "his team member", implying that the player is passing to someone on his team.
  Answer choice A describes a sumo making a goal, which is not relevant to the text and doesn't make sense.
  Answer choice B describes the player spinning and missing the goal, which could be a possible outcome, but the text doesn't mention the player spinning or missing by two feet.
  Answer choice C describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a possible outcome and makes sense based on the context of the text.
  Answer choice D describes the player failing and being called a loser, which is not a likely outcome and is not mentioned in the text.
  Therefore, the best answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The player's teammate is introduced with the possessive pronoun "his."
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be that the teammate either passes the ball to the player or does something else related to the play.
  Choice A is unlikely because it mentions a "sumo" making a goal, which is not related to the play.
  Choice B is unlikely because it describes the player spinning to evade the ball, which does not make sense in the context of the play.
  Choice D is unlikely because it describes the player failing and being called a loser, which is not a likely outcome in a team sport.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole with a person reeling it in.
  The text then mentions "others."
  Since the text has already established that the focus is on fishing, it is likely that the "others" are also fishing-related.
  Option A talks about capturing fish that the person has caught, but there is no mention of this in the text.
  Option B talks about people being in the water, but the text only mentions one person reeling in the pole.
  Option D talks about people watching a calf, which is not related to fishing.
  Option C talks about people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the pole, which is a likely scenario in ice fishing when a fish is caught.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.

  C: The number and duration of all three processes in a daily cycle will vary based on your personal styling style. Consult your hair stylist as they can help you with specific on-the-job textures and techniques.

  B: Women covering their cleavage can wear any type of chest bra. Start with a bra with a padded band, and expand as needed so that it covers your breasts.
  C: These bras are solid, have a fastening point, and have lots of support under your bra and around your waist. Depending on the material, these bras may cost at least £ 500 or more.

  The text is about how to wear a dirndl.
  The first step is to wear the appropriate undergarments, including a supportive bra with plenty of lift.
  The text mentions that many shops which carry dirndls also sell push-up bras.
  The most likely completion to the text is additional information about undergarments to wear with a dirndl.
  Choice A mentions wearing bloomers or full-coverage undies beneath the dress in case the skirt flies up while dancing and adjusting the neckline of the blouse, which is not related to undergarments.
  Choice B mentions wearing any type of chest bra but doesn't provide any additional information about the type of bra that would be best to wear with a dirndl.
  Choice C mentions a type of bra that is solid, has a fastening point, and lots of support, but the text doesn't provide enough information to suggest that this type of bra is necessary or commonly worn with a dirndl.
  Choice D mentions that push-up bras are cheap and have decent padding, which is not accurate as the text mentions that push-up bras are sold in shops carrying dirndls.

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.

  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.

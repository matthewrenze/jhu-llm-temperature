Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text is about how to help your child enjoy milk.
  The step suggests that toddlers may not want a full glass of milk and that it is okay.
  The most likely completion to the text would suggest starting with a small amount and working up to a larger portion.
  Choice A suggests using different foods to help your child get the consistency they need. This is not related to the topic at hand.
  Choice B suggests giving your child lots of milk throughout the day, which may not be helpful for children who do not like milk.
  Choice C suggests starting with one cup of milk, which is much larger than the suggested 1 to 3 oz.
  Choice D suggests starting with a small amount and working up to a larger portion.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  The step suggests that if the child refuses to drink milk, parents should start them off with a small amount such as 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
  All choices except for (D) are off-topic or contradict the instruction given in the step.
  Choice (D) suggests that if the child is willing to try a small amount of milk, gradually increasing the portion size may help them enjoy it.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is (D) If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  Choice B is discussing the amount of milk children need throughout the day, which is not the next step after starting with a small amount.
  Choice C is talking about starting the day with one cup of milk, which is not related to the topic.
  Choice D suggests that if the child likes the small amount of milk, then gradually increase the portion size.
  This is the best answer since it is related to the topic and continues with the natural progression of steps.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text is giving tips on how to help a child enjoy milk.
  The first step is to try starting with a small amount.
  Given that the child may refuse to drink milk, the completion should focus on what to do if starting with small amounts works.
  The most likely completion is to slowly work up to a larger portion to help the child decide whether they like it or not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later. 
Action: Answer("D")

  Therefore, the answer is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:

Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.
Response 0:

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Starting a campfire
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A camp fire burns brightly in the night. the fire
Choices:
  A: dances and people watch it flame.
  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The word "brightly" suggests that the fire is already burning well and is not in need of additional fuel.
  The next sentence describes the fire, so it should complete the thought about the fire.
  Out of the four options, "dances and people watch it flame" makes the most sense since it describes the movements of the fire and implies that people are enjoying it.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: The first sentence states that a campfire is burning brightly at night, so it is safe to assume that the fire is already lit. The second sentence is likely to describe what happens next or how the fire behaves. 
Option A describes the fire as dancing and people watching it flame, but there is no mention of people watching the fire in the text. 
Option B describes the fire growing in size, which is a likely outcome as the firewood is consumed. 
Option C describes lighting the fire from inside up, but there is no mention of this process in the text. 
Option D describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground, but this outcome is undesirable and dangerous. 
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the fire slowly grows in size. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the sentence should continue to describe the fire that is already burning.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already at its peak brightness and intensity.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a campfire that is already burning brightly in the night. 
  Therefore, it does not make sense to choose options B and D because they describe the beginning of a fire, not one that is already burning.
  Option C is a possibility, but it is too specific and not necessarily the most likely completion to the text.
  Option A is a more likely completion because it describes the observation of the fire.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The sentence mentions that "the fire burns brightly in the night" which means it is already burning.
  None of the options suggest how to start a campfire.
  Options B and D describe the fire growing or spreading, which is not what the sentence is asking for.
  Option A seems like the most likely choice as it describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame.
  Option C is possible, but less likely because it doesn't suggest people are watching the fire.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that "A campfire burns brightly in the night" implying that the fire is already lit.
  Option A and B both suggest that the fire is growing or moving, but the sentence mentions nothing to suggest that.
  Option D suggests that the fire is spreading across the ground which is unlikely and would be dangerous.
  Option C is the most likely completion as it suggests a safe way to light and extinguish a campfire.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sentence before the blank states "A camp fire burns brightly in the night."
  The following statement should be consistent with the initial statement and should make sense.
  The choice "dances and people watch it flame" makes sense when it comes to campfires.
  The choice "slowly grows in size" is consistent with the initial statement but does not necessarily make sense.
  The choice "is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill" does not make sense.
  The choice "rapidly spreads across the ground" is inconsistent with the initial statement.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a campfire that burns brightly in the night.
  It is unlikely that the fire is spreading rapidly across the ground because it would be dangerous and not desirable.
  It is also unlikely that the fire is slowly growing in size because the text describes the fire as burning brightly already.
  It is possible that the fire is dancing and people are watching it, but it is not clear from the context of the text.
  The most likely completion to the text is that the fire is put out behind an iron grill because this is a common safety measure used to contain a campfire.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night. The next sentence should logically build on that description.
Option A seems likely given the first sentence's description of the fire burning brightly and the phrase "watch it flame." 
Option B could be possible, but it doesn't quite fit with the word "brightly" in the first sentence.
Option C is possible, but doesn't quite make sense to "put out behind an iron grill."
Option D is unlikely given that the previous sentence describes the fire burning brightly, not spreading rapidly.
Therefore, the most likely completion for the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence describes what happens to the fire.
  It is most likely that people watch the fire, so the choice that best completes the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.

Choices:
  A: loses one goal and he walks away.
  B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
  D: better mark the match while they're still scoring.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  After earning this goal, the yellow team briefly shakes hands with each other and claps their backs in celebratory response.
  The sentence structure suggests that this is the end of the game, as it would be strange to shake hands and celebrate during the middle of a game.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal, at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that the yellow team earns another goal.
  It also describes the team's celebratory response.
  Option B states that the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response to the final goal.
  This option is consistent with the celebratory response described in the text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text states that the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates.
  The celebration is brief, which implies that the game is not yet over.
  Therefore, the yellow team will likely continue to play.
  Option A is not likely as it contradicts the fact that the yellow team earned another goal.
  Option B is similar to celebrating after the first goal and is not likely.
  Option D is not related to the context of the text.
  Option C is the most likely completion as it suggests that the yellow team is still playing and scoring despite the game being back and forth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  Based on this information, the most likely completion to the following text is that the yellow team wins the game.
  Option A and D do not make sense as they discuss the yellow team losing the game or marking the match while they are still scoring.
  Option C does not make sense as it describes the yellow team continuing to score even though the game seems to be stagnant.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the following text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:  
  The yellow team earns another goal and congratulates themselves.
  The text implies that this is not the last goal of the game as it says "further in the game".
  One possible response to scoring another goal is to hug each other in response as a celebratory gesture.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response."
  The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the yellow team earns another goal.
  The yellow team celebrates briefly with clapping on the back.
  The most likely completion should describe the yellow team's reaction to the goal.
  Option B says that the yellow team members hug each other in response.
  This response seems to fit with the celebratory tone of the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text describes a yellow team that has already earned a goal.
  The text stated that the yellow team celebrated with brief handshakes and back claps after earning the goal.
  Based on the information, it is likely that the yellow team will score another goal.
  Choice B describes the yellow uniformed team members hugging each other in response to a final goal, which fits the celebratory response described in the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates by shaking hands briefly with each other and clapping their backs in response. 
  This seems to suggest that the game is still going on.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
- The text states that the yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with handshakes and back clapping. 
- The options that do not describe further play or celebration from the yellow team can be eliminated. 
- Option C describes continued play and scoring, but there is no mention of this in the initial text, so it can be eliminated.
- Option D does not seem related to the text and can also be eliminated.
- Option B seems like a logical completion since it describes another goal and a celebratory response, similar to the initial description.
- Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  They then celebrate with brief handshakes and back clapping.
  The text is asking what is the most likely completion.
  Option A suggests the yellow team loses one goal which contradicts the initial statement.
  Option C suggests the yellow team continues scoring goals but the description only mentions one goal.
  Option D is not related to the description in the text.
  Option B suggests that the yellow team scores one final goal and hug each other which aligns with the celebratory response.
  Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.

  The text tells a story about a woman who is brushing and braiding her hair.
  Based on the context, it is likely that the sentence that follows will describe what the woman did next in the process of braiding her hair.
  Option A is a long sentence with unclear meaning. It does not seem to fit with the flow of the story.
  Option B describes the woman showing her braid while talking. Although this could be a possibility, it is not directly related to the process of braiding her hair.
  Option C mentions a "knotted hair area" which is not mentioned earlier in the text. It also describes closing the flipped hair, which is not clear.
  Option D describes the woman braiding the ends with instructions and supervision. This is not related to the process of braiding her hair and is not likely to be the answer.

Option B does not continue or complete the process of braiding.
Option C has some elements that are not mentioned before like "knotted hair area" and "large clip."

Therefore, none of the options make sense as a completion to the original text.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes a woman lying in bed and braiding her hair.

  Choice C describes the woman starting with a "knotted hair area" which is not mentioned in the original text.
  Choice D describes the woman "braiding the ends with instructions" which is not clear what is meant by "instructions."
  Choice B describes the woman "showing the braid while continuing talking" which seems plausible and doesn't contradict the original text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: ", the woman shows the braid while continuing talking." 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a woman lying on a bed and braiding her hair.
  The next sentence should continue describing what the woman does after starting the braid.
  Option A seems to describe a complete set of actions that may be unrelated to the previous sentence.
  Option C seems to describe a different set of actions than the previous sentence.
  Option D does not seem to fit with the previous sentence.
  Option B is the most likely completion of this text because it suggests that the woman is showing the braid while continuing to talk, which is a continuation of the previous sentence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: , the woman shows the braid while continues talking.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  Choice C mentions a knotted hair area and a large clip, which are not mentioned in the previous sentence.
  Choice D mentions instructions and supervision, which are not mentioned in the previous sentence.
  Choice B could be a possible completion to the text, as the woman may want to show her braid to someone while continuing to talk.
  Therefore, the answer is B: ", the woman shows the braid while continues talking.".
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The sentence talks about how a woman is braiding her hair.
  The text mentions that the woman takes a lock of front hair and braids it, taking hair from the sides.

  Option A describes the woman bryling the hair and pinning it to the back of her head and kicking it over her shoulders. This does not make sense and is grammatically incorrect.
  Option B describes the woman displaying her braid while continuing to talk. This does not make sense as there is no indication that the woman is with someone or talking to anyone.
  Option C describes the woman starting with a knotted hair area, putting the braids with a large clip, and closing the flipped hair. This does not make sense as there is no mention of the woman having a knotted hair area and the sentence is not grammatically correct.
  Option D describes the woman braiding the ends with instructions and supervision. This does not make sense as there is no context for who is giving the woman instructions and supervision.
  None of the options make sense as a likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to make your hair grow faster [title] Include protein in your daily diet. [step] Your hair and nails are primarily made up of a protein called keratin. Hair growth has three phases: anagen (when hair is growing), catagen (when growth starts to shut down), and telogen (when growth stops and/or the hair falls out).
Choices:
  A: Each phasema has a 5 to 10 percent impact on hair quality. In general, the more protein you consume, the faster your hair growth will begin.
  B: [substeps] Protein is important, both for building and maintaining hair's growth-and making it thinner by increasing the amount of protein your body burns. This will help support your hair's growth.
  C: Hair that is lacking protein goes into resting stage faster than hair rich in protein. [substeps] Chicken, eggs, and greek yogurt are great sources of protein.
  D: They are not differentiated from hair that is entirely corn. [substeps] High protein foods should be added to your diet to ensure optimal hair-growth.

[header] How to make a homemade ear cleaner [title] Get a small bottle. [step] You can either get an ear dropper bottle or a small (1 oz) brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap. [title] Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
Choices:
  A: [step] Make sure that the bottle is small enough to hold all of the oil you'll be adding to it. [substeps] Oil from your choice of product may not soften your ear canal to the point where it won't fit over a toothbrush.
  B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.
  C: [step] Add distilled water to make the bottle easier to clean. Test the ear cleaner on a small, hidden area of your ear while it is still in the bottle.
  D: [step] You can use any type of oil, but don't add more than 10 drops if you want to replicate this scent. Keep dilufying the oil between 5-10 drops.

### Temperature: 8.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Camel ride
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
Two women are sitting on a small camel. the woman on the back of the camel
Choices:
  A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
  B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  C: waves at the camera.
  D: is running and with other people walking alongside it.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The text is describing the woman on the back of the camel.
  Therefore, we need to identify what the woman on the back of the camel is doing.
  Looking at the choices, option A doesn't make sense because the two women holding the camel down wouldn't allow it to move.
  Option B might be possible, but it doesn't give us enough information to make a clear decision.
  Option C is the most likely, as it is common for people to wave at cameras when taking pictures.
  Option D doesn't make sense because the text is describing the women sitting on the camel, not running alongside it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The prompt says that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The text then specifies that there is a woman on the back of the camel.
  Based on this information, it is likely that the text will describe what the woman on the back of the camel is doing.
  Option A does not make sense as holding the camel down is not necessary while riding it.
  Option B is a possibility, but there is no evidence to support it.
  Option D is unlikely as it describes an activity that is not possible while riding a camel.
  Option C is the most likely as it is common for people to wave at cameras while riding animals such as camels.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The two women are sitting on the camel, which suggests the camel is not moving quickly.
  It is unlikely that the woman on the back would be running while the other woman is sitting in front of her.
  The text does not mention any other people, so it is unlikely that there are other people walking alongside the camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is not mentioned doing anything with her hands, so it is unlikely that she is waving.
  The most likely completion is that the woman on the back is sitting close to the woman in front of her.
  The answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The direction of the text is describing an action or a scene.
  The woman on the back of the camel is described.
  We can assume that the text is about a camel ride.
  A woman looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down while riding seems unlikely.
  A woman running alongside the camel with other people walking alongside it does not match the current text.
  The most likely completion would be something that describes the woman on the back of the camel.
  The woman waving at the camera would be a likely completion.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The prompt provides a description of the woman in the back of the camel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the following text is that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something.
  Looking at her phone while the two women hold the camel down or waving at the camera is more likely than starting knee to knee with the woman on the front or running with other people walking alongside it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  One woman is on the back of the camel.
  The text does not mention anything about holding the camel down or running or people walking alongside the camel.
  Since the two women are sitting on a camel, one of the women is likely to interact with the other woman or the environment in some way.
  Looking at the phone seems unlikely since the women are on a camel ride and may be interested in the scenery.
  Waving at the camera seems like a likely option because people often take pictures during camel rides.
  Starting knee to knee with the woman on the front may also be a possibility since the two women are sitting closely together on the camel.
  However, since the text does not mention anything to suggest that the women are just starting their ride, waving at the camera seems like the more likely option.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The question describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The next sentence starts with "the woman", suggesting that it refers to one of the two women already mentioned.
  The woman on the back of the camel is the only one not further described.
  It is common to take pictures while on a camel ride.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be that the woman on the back of the camel waves at the camera.
  The answer is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is described, but there is no mention of anyone else in the picture.
  Option A talks about holding the camel down, which doesn't make sense in this context.
  The text does not mention anything about the women being close enough for knee-to-knee contact.
  Option C is a possibility, as it is common for people to wave at the camera when taking pictures.
  But since the picture is described as being of two women on a camel, it is more likely that the woman on the back is also in the picture and therefore the most likely completion to the text is that she waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The sentence says that two women are riding a small camel.
  The sentence then describes the woman who is on the back of the camel.
  None of the choices seem to make sense as a completion to the sentence because they all start new actions and unrelated details.
  However, option C seems like it is the most likely choice because it describes something that the woman on the back of the camel could be doing at that moment.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The phrase "the woman on the back of the camel" suggests that there are two women on the camel.
  Therefore, the woman on the back of the camel is not alone.
  The text does not suggest anything about holding the camel down or running.
  There is no mention of other people walking alongside the camel.
  Looking at her phone or waving at the camera are the only possible actions mentioned.
  The text does not suggest any fear or discomfort, so it is more likely that the woman is looking at her phone or waving at the camera.

Thought: 
  The first two steps describe washing and blow-drying hair.
  The next step should logically be about styling the hair.
  Option A suggests brushing and sectioning hair, which is a common step in styling hair.

  Option C suggests using a dry shampoo and conditioner, which is not mentioned in the first two steps.
  Option D suggests wearing an updo, which is a specific hairstyle and not a general tip for achieving a cute summer hairstyle.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: [title] Next, gently brush out tangles, starting at the ends and slowly working your way to the roots. [title] Section your hair into two parts-the top half and the bottom half. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:

  Option B suggests using a wide-toothed comb, which is also a common tool for styling curly hair.
  Option C is unrelated and does not provide useful instructions for styling the hair.

Topic: Health
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

  The most likely completion to the text based on this information is that if more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.
  The answer is C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The article is about how to recognize implantation bleeding.
  The first step is to consider the timing of the bleeding.
  The article asks readers to recall when was the last time they had sex.
  The next step should be related to timing and not to a rash or energy fluctuations.
  Option A is incorrect because it talks about waiting for the numbers to change and does not provide any additional information to recognize implantation bleeding.
  Option B is incorrect because it talks about energy fluctuation instead of providing any relevant information.
  Option C is relevant since it mentions a timeframe by which implantation bleeding is likely to occur, and also mentions an important point that some women mistake implantation bleeding for their normal menstrual cycle.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding.

Response 0:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  It is likely that his team member is involved in the play to try to score.
  Option A, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats, does not seem to logically fit with the rest of the text. 
  Option B, spinning quickly to evade the ball and missed the goal by two feet, does not match the idea that the player is trying to hit a goal.
  Option D, failing the first time and being called a loser, seems inappropriate and negative.
  Option C, trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, makes sense and is in line with the actions of a lacrosse game. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next action of a teammate is likely to be related to the first player's action, rather than an unrelated event.
  Option A does not make sense because it mentions a "sumo" instead of a teammate.
  Option B suggests that the player missed the goal, which contradicts the original statement that the player was trying to hit the goal.
  Option D is not a likely completion to the text since it is insulting and does not address the current situation.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it suggests that the teammate is following the ball and helping to keep it away from the opponent team player.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is "aggressively" chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence should describe what happens after the player makes a move with the ball.
  Answer A doesn't make sense because it mentions a "sumo" which is not related to lacrosse.
  Answer B doesn't fit the context because it describes the player missing the goal by two feet, but the question says the player is "trying to hit a goal".
  Answer D is irrelevant because it doesn't relate to the player's actions after he chases the ball.
  Answer C makes the most sense because it describes the player following the ball and trying to keep it away from an opponent team player.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team is trying to hit a goal with his lacrosse stick.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member", which means the completion should be a continuation of what the blue team member does and not what the opposing team does.
  Option A doesn't make sense because it mentions the "sumo" making a goal, which is not related to the story.
  Option B doesn't make sense because it describes the blue team member missing the goal, which conflicts with the previous sentence.
  Option D is inappropriate and negative, so it can be eliminated.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it describes the blue team member continuing to try to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team chases the ball with his lacrosse stick to hit a goal.
  The sentence ends with "his team member", suggesting that something happens next involving another player from the same team.
  Option A does not make sense as it introduces a new player, the "sumo", who was not mentioned before.
  Option B also does not make sense as it suggests the player from the blue team misses the goal and spins to evade the ball, which contradicts the first part of the sentence.
  Option D is unlikely as it seems overly negative and does not fit with the positive and competitive nature of sports.
  Option C is the most likely completion, as it suggests that the player tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a common strategy in lacrosse.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The player is chasing the ball and trying to hit a goal, so he is likely attempting to score.
  His team member could do a number of things to help him or herself and the team.
  Option A does not make logical sense, because a "sumo" does not relate to lacrosse, and it is unlikely that the blue team would react before they know if a goal was made.
  Option B is a possibility, but it is not the most likely, because the player is described as aggressive and trying to hit the goal.
  Option D is unlikely because it is not a positive or helpful action for a teammate to call someone a loser.
  Option C is the most likely completion to the text, because it would make sense for the teammate to try to help the player by following the ball and keeping it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text mentions that a player from the blue team chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  His team member either passes, spins, or follows the ball to assist him.
  Failing the first time and being called a loser is not likely, and there is no mention of a sumo making a goal.
  The most likely completion is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The sentence states that a player from the blue team is chasing the ball and trying to hit a goal.
  The next sentence starts with "his team member," which implies that the player mentioned earlier is going to pass the ball to his teammate.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to make a goal.
  One of his teammates may help him by passing the ball.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that his team member passes to another teammate.
  This teammate makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
  The answer is A: Passes to another teammate, the teammate makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The player from the blue team is chasing the ball aggressively with his lacrosse stick to hit a goal.
  It is likely that his team member will be involved in the next action.
  The action could be passing the ball or trying to score a goal.
  Options A and D sound unlikely because they don't fit the context.
  Option B is not likely because the text says that the player is trying to hit a goal and the option says that he misses it.
  Option C seems most likely because it is related to keeping the ball away from the opponent team player.

Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.

  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and playing drums with a choreography.
  There are kids walking in circles behind the band.
  The most likely description of what the kids are doing is that they are also doing a choreography.
  Option A doesn't make much sense as it describes kids "showing side by side shaking their hands", which is not related to the scene described.
  Option B also seems unlikely as it talks about kids "walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around." which doesn't fit the scene.
  Option C seems plausible, as it describes the kids sitting and looking at the band.

Response 1:
Thought: 
  The man is training for weightlifting events for the Olympics.
  He picks up weights several times and lifts them over his head.
  The text suggests that sometimes he fails and sometimes he is successful.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The man in the video is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  The word "sometimes" indicates that there are variations in his lifts.
  Option A seems unlikely and exaggerated.
  Option B contradicts the statement that he lifts the weight over his head.
  Option C is incomplete and doesn't make sense.
  Option D seems the most likely because it suggests that the man is both successful and unsuccessful in his lifts, which is typical of training for any sport.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The man is training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The text mentions he lifts the weight over his head several times.
  The text says "sometimes he" indicating that two contrasting situations may follow.
  Option A doesn't seem realistic since it mentions he is dragged to the ground.
  Option B could be an answer but it is not a weightlifting technique.
  Option C is not the right answer since it is not a weightlifting technique either.
  Option D seems to be the most plausible answer since it mentions the man fails sometimes but succeeds other times, which is a common occurrence in weightlifting.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a video of a man training for weightlifting events.
  The man picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  He picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  However, the question wants to know what happens sometimes when he lifts the weight over his head.
  It is unlikely he is dragged to the ground or lowers his arms and his hands up.
  It is also unlikely he puts down the weight to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
  The most likely answer is that sometimes he fails while other times he is successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The man is training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The text describes him lifting weights several times.
  The options are:
    A: Lifts so far he is dragged to the ground -> this seems unlikely and unrealistic.
    B: Put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it -> this does not make sense as he is already holding the weight and lifting it over his head.
    C: Lowers his arms and hands up -> this does not make sense either as the text describes him lifting weight, not lowering it.
    D: Fails, other times he is successful -> this seems like the most accurate completion as it suggests that the man is practicing and sometimes succeeding and other times failing.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weights several times over his head.
  The sentence begins with the phrase "sometimes he," indicating that the sentence should describe something that occasionally happens while he lifts weights.
  Option A, "lifts so far he is dragged to the ground," is unlikely as it would be dangerous and would not help the man's training.
  Option B, "put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it," is unlikely as it does not describe the man's weightlifting performance.
  Option C, "lowers his arms and his hands up," is also unlikely as it does not make sense.
  Option D, "fails, other times he is successful," is the most likely option as it describes the man's performance in weightlifting, which may include both successes and failures.
Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.

Choices:
  A: see a mop and bucket laying on a chair.
  B: see the people taking their darts and see another man.
  C: see a man punching a hole in a wall.
  D: see a title screen.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The lady is holding a dart and throwing it at a bulletin board.
  Shots of a man in a different room are shown.
  The completion should make sense with these two statements.
  Option A mentions a mop and bucket, which does not fit with the two statements.
  Option B mentions people taking their darts and another man, but it is unclear how this fits with the two statements.
  Option C mentions a man punching a hole in a wall, which does not fit with the two statements.
  Option D mentions a title screen, but it is unclear what this means in the context of the given statements.
  None of these options seem to be a likely completion of the text.
  Since none of the options are likely, I will select the most likely answer which is C: None of the above.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text.
  The text mentions a lady throwing darts at a bulletin board and a man in a different room.
  There is no connection between the lady throwing darts and a mop and bucket on a chair, so A is unlikely.
  B has no connection to the story and is unlikely.
  C seems completely irrelevant to the story and unlikely.
  D is possible, but does not complete the story in any way.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The lady is shown throwing darts at a bulletin board.
  Shots of a man in a different room are shown.
  It is unlikely that the completion will mention a mop and bucket, since it is not related to the scene.
  It is also unlikely that the completion will mention people taking their darts, since no information about that has been given.
  It is also unlikely that the completion will mention a man punching a hole in a wall, since it is not related to the scene and no information has been given to suggest that.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that we see another man. 
  The answer is B: see the people taking their darts and see another man. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The lady throws darts at a bulletin board. 
  Then, the next sentence needs to have a connection to the previous sentence.
  A mop and bucket, people taking their darts, another man, and a title screen are not related to the previous sentence.
  Punching a hole in a wall is not directly related to throwing darts, but it is a plausible action that could occur in this context.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is:
Action: Answer("C")

  There is no indication that the man is punching a hole in the wall or that there is a title screen.
  There is no meaningful or logical connection between the lady throwing darts and a mop and bucket on a chair.
  The most likely completion to the text is that after seeing the lady throwing darts, we see shots of the man in the other room throwing darts as well.
  Therefore, the answer is B: see the people taking their darts and see another man.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The question describes a lady throwing darts at a bulletin board and a man in a different room.
  The next sentence must be a continuation of the narrative that makes sense.

[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.
  D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

  D: then cuts up vegetables and butters bread then putting various ingredients on the bread to make a sandwich.
Response 0:

  Option B talks about melting cheese onto bread, which is also not related to cooking the bacon.
  Option C talks about slicing cheese and bacon together, which may not be necessary at this point.

  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the person then cooks the bacon.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 1:

  Choice B mentions bread, but the text does not mention bread or making a sandwich.
  Choice C mentions slicing cheese and bacon together, but the text only mentions putting bacon in a pan.
  Choice D mentions making a sandwich and cutting vegetables, but the text does not mention vegetables or making a sandwich.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the person will cook the bacon in the pan and complete a bacon dish.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:

  The text mentions putting bacon in a pan, so we should look for an answer choice that continues with this action.
  Answer choice A mentions frying cheese, which was not mentioned before, so it is not the most likely completion.
  Answer choice B mentions melting cheese onto bread, which was not mentioned before, so it is not the most likely completion.
  Answer choice D mentions cutting up vegetables and butters bread, which was not mentioned before, so it is not the most likely completion.
  Answer choice C mentions slicing cheese and bacon together, which is a likely continuation of the action.
  Therefore, the answer is C: then slices cheese and bacon together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
    The picture shows a person putting bacon into a pan. 
    This person is likely in the process of making something with bacon.

    Option B mentions using a skillet to melt cheese onto bread, but there is no bread visible in the prompt. 
    Option D mentions cutting up vegetables and making a sandwich, but there is no mention of vegetables and the prompt only shows bacon in a pan. 
    Option C mentions slicing cheese and bacon together. 
    This option makes the most sense as the prompt shows bacon and cheese would be a great combination. 
    Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be, "then slices cheese and bacon together."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a person putting bacon into a pan.
  The photograph might provide additional clues as to what kind of sandwich is being made, but it isn't given.
  Option A describes a person frying cheese, putting it into an egg pan, and scrubbing it down with a spatula. This doesn't seem relevant to the initial text.
  Option B describes a person using a skillet to melt cheese onto bread. This doesn't seem directly related to the initial text either.
  Option C describes a person slicing cheese and bacon together. This seems like a possible next step in making a sandwich.
  Option D describes a person cutting up vegetables and butters bread then putting various ingredients on the bread to make a sandwich. This seems like a plausible next step.
  Option C seems like a more likely completion because it directly follows the initial step of putting bacon into a pan.
Action: Answer("C")

  Option B is possible, but it doesn't mention anything about making a sandwich.
  Option C is more likely because it follows a logical sequence of putting bacon and cheese together.
  Option D is possible, but it doesn't specifically reference using bacon or cheese.
  Therefore, the answer is C: then slices cheese and bacon together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes a person putting bacon into a pan after a photograph of food is shown.
  The most likely completion is a logical step that would follow putting bacon into a pan.

  The answer is A: then fries cheese and puts it in an egg pan, and scrubs it down with the spatula.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a person putting bacon into a pan.

  The options are:
    A. Are shown capturing the fish that he has captured in the area.
    B. Are shown mostly off in the water followed by more people reeling the fishing pole in.
    C. Kneel around him as he continues to reel.
    D. Are seen on the bank watching a calf as it is released.
  Option A does not make sense because it is redundant to say "capturing the fish that he has captured." 
  Option B does not make sense given the description of the image, which only shows one person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Option D doesn't make sense because it describes people watching a calf, which is not related to fishing.
  Option C makes the most sense because it describes people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the fishing pole.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the following text is "C.Kneel around him as he continues to reel."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text describes a close up of a fishing pole being reeled in by someone.
  The choices suggest different scenarios of what could be happening around the person.
  Choice A suggests that others are shown capturing the fish, but the text only describes the person reeling in the fishing pole.
  Choice B suggests that most people are off in the water, which is unlikely since they should be on the ice.
  Choice C suggests that others are around the person reeling in the fish, which is the most likely scenario.
  Choice D describes a scene that is not related to the fishing activity.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that others 'kneel around him as he continues to reel.' 
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes a close up of a fishing pole being reeled in by a person.
  The options describe what others are doing during this time.
  Option A describes others capturing fish in the area, but there is no evidence of this in the text.
  Option B describes others off in the water, but it seems unlikely that others would be in the water while one person is fishing.
  Option D describes others watching a calf being released, but this is completely unrelated to the text.
  Option C describes others kneeling around the person reeling in the fish, which seems likely.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text mentions a close up of a fishing pole being reeled in.
  The question asks about what happens around the person with the fishing pole.
  Option A mentions "capturing the fish" but there is no mention of fish being caught or captured.
  Option B mentions people being in the water, but the text only mentions one person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Option D mentions a calf being released, which has no relation to the text about fishing.
  Option C mentions people kneeling around the person reeling, which is possible when fishing.
  Therefore, the best completion to the text is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  The next sentence should describe what others are doing.
  Option A describes others capturing the fish that the person has captured, but it doesn't make sense because we don't know if the person has caught any fish yet.
  Option B describes others mostly off in the water followed by more people reeling the fishing pole in, but it doesn't make sense because it's not clear why others are in the water when the person is reeling in a fishing pole.
  Option C describes others kneeling around him as he continues to reel, which makes sense since they are probably watching him fish and waiting to help him with the fish once it's caught.
  Option D is unrelated to the text and doesn't make sense.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes "A close up of a fishing pole is shown with a person reeling it in."
  The text then states "others" meaning more than one person.
  Option A is unlikely because it suggests that the person has captured multiple fish already, but the text only describes one person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Option B is also unlikely because it suggests that most people are in the water, but the text only describes one person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Option D is unrelated and does not make sense in the context of the text.
  Option C is the most likely completion because it describes others kneeling around the person as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes the action that is being shown in the image.
  The fishing pole is being reeled in by a person.
  It is most likely that others are shown doing something related to the person reeling the fishing pole in.
  Option A is a likely completion, but it is redundant.
  Option B is not related to the image's description.
  Option D is not related to ice fishing.
  Option C is the most likely completion because others are probably kneeling around the person as he reels in the fishing pole.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
  The fishing pole is being reeled in by a person.
  The text states "others" which indicates there are other people involved.
  Option A talks about capturing fish, but there is no mention of fish being caught.
  Option B does not make sense as it talks about people being mostly off in the water.
  Option D refers to a calf being released which is not related to fishing.
  Option C makes the most sense as it describes people kneeling around the person who is reeling in the fishing pole.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes a close-up of a fishing pole with a person reeling it in.
  The other options do not relate to the image.

Choices:
  A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
  B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
  C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall.
  D: runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar and dropping it while others watch.
  The completion should describe what he does next.
  Option A describes him wiping off his sweat and repeating the process.
  Option B describes him releasing the bar and a beam he was holding and dropping it near the floor which is not related to the previous action. 
  Option C describes him lifting for another couple of seconds and then dropping it which could be possible, but the part where the others fall doesn't make sense.
  Option D describes him running towards the weight and the others falling with the weight, which doesn't make sense either.
  Option A seems like the most likely completion because it is related to the previous action and is a normal behavior in between reps.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down while two other bodybuilders watch him. The correct option must be consistent with this description. Option A describes the weightlifter wiping off his sweat, but it does not complete the story of what happens after he drops the bar. Option B describes the weightlifter dropping the beam, which is not mentioned in the story. Option C describes the weightlifter continuing to lift before dropping the weight, which is not mentioned in the story either. Option D describes the weightlifter running towards the weight as the others fall, which is not mentioned in the description.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the story is that the weightlifter drops the weight bar and it falls near the floor.
The answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar and dropping it while being watched by two other bodybuilders.
  The next sentence should describe what the first bodybuilder does next.
  Choice A describes the bodybuilder wiping off his sweat, lifting the weight bar again, and then dropping it. This does not make sense because there is no reason for the bodybuilder to wipe off his sweat in this context, and it does not follow naturally from what was described before.
  Choice B describes the bodybuilder dropping the weight bar as well as a beam he was holding, which does not make sense because there was no mention of a beam before.
  Choice C describes the bodybuilder continuing to lift for a couple more seconds before dropping the weight bar, which is possible but not necessarily what is indicated by the previous sentence.
  Choice D describes the bodybuilder running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down, which does not make sense in the context of the previous sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the bodybuilder releases the weight bar, as described in choice B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it down while others watch him.
  The question is asking what the bodybuilder does next.
  Answer A suggests that the bodybuilder wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it, but there is no mention of a towel or a repeat lift in the text.
  Answer C suggests that the bodybuilder continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops the weight and the bodybuilders fall, but there is no indication that the other bodybuilders fall in the text.
  Answer D suggests that the bodybuilder runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down, but again, there is no mention of the other bodybuilders falling in the text.
  Answer B suggests that the bodybuilder releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor, which seems plausible based on the text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text mentions that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and drops it down while the other two body builders watch him.
  The next sentence should describe what happens next.
  Option A describes the body builder wiping off his sweat with a towel and lifting the weight bar again and drops it.
  Option B mentions the body builder releasing the weight bar and the beam he was holding and drops it down near the floor.
  Option C describes the body builder lifting for another couple of seconds before dropping it and the other body builders falling.
  Option D mentions the body builder running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
  Options A and D do not seem plausible and the text does not indicate that the body builders fall.
  Option B seems unlikely since there is no mention of a beam being held.
  Option C seems the most likely as a continuation of the description of the body builder lifting and dropping the weight bar.
  Therefore, the answer is C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down in front of the other two body builders.
  The next sentence will most likely describe what the body builder does after he dropped the weight.
  Option A says that the body builder wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it. This sentence is a possibility but there is not enough information to suggest that he wiped off his sweat. 
  Option B says that he releases the weight bar and the beam he was holding and drops it down near the floor. There is no  mention of a beam in the previous sentence, making it an unlikely choice.
  Option C says that the body builder lifts for another couple of seconds and then drops it, and the other body builders fall. There is no mention of the other body builders lifting weights with him, making it an unlikely choice.
  Option D says that the body builder runs towards the weight as the others fall and watch him drop down. This sentence does not make sense in the context of the previous sentence.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the body builder prepares to lift again or walks away. There is not enough information in the previous sentence to determine what he does exactly after dropping the weight. 
  The answer is None of the Above. 
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a woman playing her harmonica in an elevator.
  A person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  There is no indication in the text that the man on the stretcher is injured due to a car accident.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that they begin trying to help the woman as the man is cut up on a car.
  The text does not mention any visible reaction to the woman's playing.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that they smile at her and compliment her.
  The text does not mention any tubes on the ground or winding down.
  Therefore, it is unlikely that they are walking around with tubes on the ground and getting ready to wind down.
  The last choice seems to be unrelated to the passage.

Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:

  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The woman is seen holding a jar of honey and she leads into rubbing honey on her face.
  We need to choose the most likely completion of the text.
  Option A says she dries off the mask, but there is no mention of a mask in the text.
  Option B says she braces her fingers on the jar and puts it to her face, which is possible, but does not necessarily follow from the text.
  Option C says she pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off, but there is no mention of drying her face off.
  Option D says she wipes down her face and leads back to her, which is possible, but there is no mention of wiping her face down.
  Therefore, option B is the most likely completion because it follows from the text that she would eventually put the jar to her face.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The woman is rubbing honey on her face. 
The question is asking for what happens next.
Option A is unlikely, as the woman is expected to leave the honey on her face to dry off.
Option C is not expected as the woman already applied honey to her face. 
Option D is not expected as the woman needs to complete the process of rubbing honey on her face.
Option B is the most likely completion as the woman was holding the jar of honey and then led to rubbing it on her face.
So, the answer is B: braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The woman is shown holding a jar of honey and then rubbing it onto her face.
  From this information, we can assume that the woman is likely demonstrating a method of washing one's face with honey.
  The prompt doesn't give any indication that the woman wipes off the honey, so option D is unlikely.
  Option C suggests that the woman pours honey onto her fingers before drying her face off, but the prompt doesn't mention anything about drying one's face off with a towel.
  Option A suggests that the woman finishes rubbing honey on her face and then dries off the mask. However, the prompt doesn't mention anything about a "mask". Also, the prompt doesn't say anything about the woman wearing a smile.
  Option B suggests that the woman then braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face, which makes sense in the context of someone demonstrating a skincare routine.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face.
Action: Answer("B")

[header] How to help your child enjoy milk [title] Try small amounts at first. [step] Toddlers especially may not want a full 8-oz glass (237 ml) of milk, and that's ok. If your child refuses to drink milk, try starting them off with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml).
Choices:
  A: When they're fully the consistency they need, begin gradually introducing them to milk. Initially, you may want to try using cottage cheese or something fatty, such as chicken, rather than a trans-fat.
  B: [substeps] Small children more often need ½ cup (120 ml) or more milk. [title] Give your child lots of milk throughout the day.
  C: [substeps] Some people can start the day with one cup (237 ml) milk at a time. However, you may need to try multiple servings if they are still feeling a little full.
  D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  The text explains how to help children enjoy milk.
  The first step is to try small amounts at first.
  The next step should be to increase the amount gradually.
  Choice C suggests that you may start serving one cup of milk at a time, but this may be too much for toddlers.
  Choice A suggests using cottage cheese or something fatty, which is not related to drinking milk.
  Choice B suggests giving children lots of milk throughout the day, but it does not mention how to help them enjoy it.
  Choice D suggests that if 1-3 oz of milk works, you can offer larger portions gradually.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.
Action: Answer("D")

Thought: 
  The text is about how to help a child enjoy milk.
  The current step suggests trying small amounts of milk for toddlers who refuse to drink it.
  It is logical for the following completion to suggest starting with smaller amounts and gradually increasing it, in case the child starts liking it.
  Option A talks about gradually introducing the child to fatty foods which is not relevant to the text.
  Option B suggests giving lots of milk throughout the day which is not recommended.
  Option C talks about having a full cup of milk which may be overwhelming for a child who doesn't like milk.
  Option D suggests starting with small amounts and working your way up, which is consistent with the current step and makes most sense.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later. 
Action: Answer("D")

The text suggests starting with a smaller amount of milk like 1 to 3 oz (30 to 89 ml), especially if the child refuses to drink milk.
Option A suggests using food items that are fatty or have trans-fat, which is not mentioned in the text.
Option B suggests giving the child a lot of milk throughout the day, which conflicts with the text suggestion of starting with small amounts.
Option C suggests starting the day with one cup of milk, which is contrary to the text suggestion of starting with a smaller amount.
Option D suggests slowly working up to a larger portion like 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml) if the small amount works, which aligns with the text suggestion of starting with a small amount like 1 to 3 oz.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.

  Option B suggests giving the child lots of milk throughout the day without mentioning small amounts.
  Option D agrees with the text and suggests gradually increasing the amount to a larger portion.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: If that works, slowly work your way up to a larger portion such as 6 to 8 oz (177 to 237 ml). Even if they only take a sip, they may decide they like it and want more later.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The text is discussing ways to help a child enjoy drinking milk.
  The first step mentioned is to try small amounts of milk, starting with 1 to 3 oz.

  Choice A discusses the consistency of food and is not related to the topic of milk.
  Choice B contradicts the previous step by suggesting giving the child lots of milk throughout the day. 
  Choice C suggests that one cup of milk can be given at a time, which is more than what was suggested in the previous step.

[header] How to make a lemon face cleanser [title] Pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl. [step] Lemon juice is naturally antibacterial, and it can help reduce acne. It would be best if you use fresh lemon juice for this, but bottled may also work.
Choices:
  A: [title] Add 6 drops of lemon essential oil and 1 teaspoon of honey to the bowl. [step] Fresh lemon oil has antibacterial properties and makes your skin more pleasant, which aids in reducing acne.
  B: [title] Massage the lemon juice into your face with gentle circular motions. [step] Start with the freckle, and work up towards it.
  C: If you are using fresh lemon juice, be sure to strain out the seeds and pulp first. [title] Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of plain yogurt.
  D: [substeps] Most grocery stores do not provide lemon juice. [title] Blend the lemon with 1 tablespoon of water.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text provides instructions on how to make a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step is pouring 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a bowl.
  The text mentions that lemon juice is antibacterial and reduces acne.
  The text mentions the use of fresh or bottled lemon juice.
  The answer should be a continuation of the process of making a lemon face cleanser.
  Option A mentions adding lemon essential oil and honey, which was not mentioned in the text.
  Option B mentions massaging the lemon juice into the face, which is a possible continuation of the process.
  Option C mentions adding plain yogurt, which was not mentioned in the text.
  Option D mentions blending the lemon with water, which is a possible continuation of the process.
  The most likely completion to the text appears to be B.
 Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text is about making a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl.
  The step also mentions that fresh lemon juice is preferred, but bottled may also work.
  None of the answer choices seem to be related to making a face cleanser with lemon juice, except for choice C.
  Choice C suggests straining out the seeds and pulp if using fresh lemon juice and adding plain yogurt.
  Adding yogurt seems like a plausible continuation of the recipe.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to [title] Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of plain yogurt.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text is about making a lemon face cleanser.
  The step given is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a bowl.
  The text mentions that lemon juice is naturally antibacterial and can help reduce acne.
  The choice that logically adds a complementary step to the given step and aligns with the purpose of making a face cleanser using lemon juice is A. Option B seems like a step for a facial massage. Option C adds an additional step that is not complementary to the given step. Option D is incorrect as it suggests blending rather than pouring.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text outlines steps to make a lemon face cleanser.
  The current step mentions using fresh lemon juice, but bottled may also work.
  The upcoming step must be a continuation of the process and must involve a specific action to produce the lemon face cleanser.
  A and D are irrelevant and do not offer a continuation of the process.
  B suggests massaging the lemon juice into the face, but it does not introduce any additional ingredients to make the cleanser.
  C mentions an additional ingredient, plain yogurt, but does not provide a specific action to create the cleanser.
  The only relevant step that fits the criteria is to add water to the lemon juice, so the answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a simple way to make a face cleanser using lemon juice.
  The next step in the process should logically follow from the first step provided in the text.
  A is incorrect as it introduces additional ingredients that were not mentioned in the first step and is not in line with the purpose of making a face cleanser.
  B is incorrect as it goes straight to the step where the user has to massage the face without giving any other additional details on what to do or what to expect next.
  C is incorrect as it introduces a new step that should have come before the first step provided on the text.
  D is incorrect as it introduces a new step that is not necessary for the purpose of making a face cleanser from lemon juice.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text provides a recipe for a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl.
  The text mentions that lemon juice is naturally antibacterial and can help reduce acne.
  The correct answer will provide a logical next step in the recipe.
  Option A talks about the addition of lemon essential oil and honey and its benefits, but this is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B asks to massage the lemon juice into the face with circular motion, which could be a possible step.
  Option C talks about straining out the seeds and adding yogurt, but this is not the next logical step in the recipe.
  Option D says grocery stores do not provide lemon juice, which is incorrect.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be to massage the lemon juice into the face with gentle circular motions. Option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text is providing instruction on how to make a face cleanser using lemon juice.
  The first step is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl, and the text explains that fresh lemon juice is preferred.
  Since the text already provides a step to pour the lemon juice, it is unlikely that the correct completion will also instruct to blend the lemon with water.
  Also, the text seems to be providing instructions only for the first step of the face cleanser.
  Therefore, option A which gives instructions on how to add lemon essential oil and honey and option C which provides instructions on using yogurt are unlikely.
  Option B, which instructs to massage the lemon juice into the face with gentle circular motions after pouring it into a small bowl, seems unrelated and incomplete.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is C: If you are using fresh lemon juice, be sure to strain out the seeds and pulp first. [title] Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of plain yogurt.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text is about making a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl and it's mentioned that fresh lemon juice is better.
  The second sentence mentions that lemon juice is naturally antibacterial and helps to reduce acne, which is a clue on what the further steps would be.
  Option A is about adding other components, which are not mentioned in the initial step.
  Option B is about massaging the lemon juice on the face, which may be a step but it's not a logical continuation from the initial step.
  Option C tells us to strain out the seeds and pulp if fresh lemon juice is being used and adding plain yogurt, which are not mentioned in the initial step either.
  Option D is not a continuation from the first sentence and is not relevant to making the lemon face cleanser.
  Therefore, the most feasible answer is C: If you are using fresh lemon juice, be sure to strain out the seeds and pulp first. [title] Add 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of plain yogurt. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text explains how to make a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step is to pour 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl and use fresh lemon juice or bottled.
  The next step should be related to using the lemon juice.
  Choice A explains how to add lemon essential oil and honey to the bowl, which is not related to using the lemon juice as a face cleanser.
  Choice B explains how to massage the lemon juice into your face, which is the most likely and reasonable step.
  Choice C suggests adding plain yogurt to the lemon juice, but it does not explain how to use them for a face cleanser.
  Choice D talks about blending the lemon with water, which is not useful for cleaning the face.
  Therefore, the answer is B: [title] Massage the lemon juice into your face with gentle circular motions. [step] Start with the freckle, and work up towards it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text is about making a lemon face cleanser.
  The first step already suggests how to use lemon juice.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is a step that is specifically related to making the cleanser.
  Choice A is about adding lemon essential oil and honey, which is not in line with the first step of just using lemon juice.
  Choice B is about massaging the lemon juice into the face, which is plausible but not specific to making a cleanser.
  Choice C is about using fresh lemon juice, which is already mentioned in the first step.
  Choice D is about grocery stores not having lemon juice, which is not relevant to the instructions.
  Therefore, the best answer is none of the above and cannot be determined.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 8 of 100 ###
Topic: Family Life
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to set expectations for your children's behavior in public [title] Make sure your expectations are age appropriate. [step] Children develop at their own pace. There are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do, but there is no guarantee that your child isn't a little ahead or behind that guideline.
Choices:
  A: Know your child's goals before setting an expectation. [substeps] Adjust your expectations a little (rather than entirely) so that your expectations have a more rigid, consequences-by-consequence definition.
  B: [substeps] For example, you might tell your child that in early childhood, they had no manners and were expected to stand behind their classmates and make eye contact. Later in life, they may sometimes step forward or slightly back.
  C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
  D: Children may change during the first few years of life, but after a few years they will begin making new friends and become more independent. [substeps] This is particularly important in adolescence, since adolescents generally gain some degree of maturity throughout adolescence.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text is about setting expectations for children's behavior in public, and the previous sentence states that there are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for things that a child might be expected to do.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be a statement that is related to developmental milestones.
  Option A talks about knowing your child's goals and adjusting your expectations, but it doesn't talk specifically about developmental milestones.
  Option B talks about giving an example of how a child might develop in terms of behavior, but it doesn't provide general advice about how to set expectations based on developmental milestones.
  Option C talks about doing research to learn about developmental milestones and evaluating whether your expectations are realistic, which is in line with the idea that there are milestones that can guide expectations.
  Option D talks about children becoming more independent, but doesn't provide specific guidance about how to set expectations based on developmental milestones.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text discusses setting expectations for children's behavior in public and mentions developmental milestones that provide guidelines.
  The next step should be related to how to use these milestones to set age-appropriate expectations.
  Choice A mentions adjusting expectations and consequences, but it doesn't mention developmental milestones.
  Choice B talks about providing an example of how expectations change as a child ages but doesn't provide clear guidance on how to set expectations.
  Choice D talks about children's development, but it doesn't mention how to set expectations.
  Choice C talks about doing research to learn about milestones and adjusting expectations based on the age and behavior of the child.
  Choice C seems to be the best completion to the text as it provides guidance on using milestones to set age-appropriate expectations. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The paragraph provides tips on how to set expectations for your children's behavior in public.
  The first step is to make sure your expectations are age-appropriate.
  The paragraphs mention that children develop at their own pace, so there are no guarantees for each milestone.
  Option A doesn't seem to complete the paragraph well. It talks about setting goals before setting expectations - something that isn't already mentioned in the paragraph.
  Option D talks about children becoming more independent, but it doesn't seem to flow well with the first sentence of the paragraph.
  Option C seems to be the best choice as it provides a tip to research developmental milestones that provide a guideline for setting age-appropriate expectations. 
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The paragraph discusses how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  It mentions that children develop at their own pace and while there are guidelines, children may fall ahead or behind the standards.
  Therefore, it is best to ensure that the expectations set are age-appropriate.
  Choice C is most closely related to what is said in the paragraph.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The paragraph is discussing how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The paragraph mentions that children develop at their own pace, therefore guidelines might not be appropriate.
  The most likely completion to the text may be discussing how to set appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public.
  Choice B discusses how to set expectations for the age of the child, which is in line with the paragraph's discussion.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The text is discussing the importance of setting age-appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The first step is acknowledging that children develop at their own pace.
  The second step is about developmental milestones.
  The third step seems to be about adjusting expectations based on these developmental milestones.
  Choice A is not a likely completion because it talks about knowing your child's goals rather than developmental milestones.
  Choice B seems like it might have some helpful information, but it is not a completion of the paragraph and doesn't focus on making sure expectations are age-appropriate.
  Choice D talks about children becoming more independent, but it is not a completion of the paragraph and is not focused on age-appropriate expectations.
  Choice C makes sense because it is focused on the importance of understanding developmental milestones and evaluating whether your expectations are realistic based on your child's age and behavior.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Do some research to learn about these milestones, since they are not common knowledge. Before you go out, you should keep in mind the age of your child and the behaviors that they typically display, and evaluate whether your expectations are realistic. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text provides advice on how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The second sentence advises that expectations should be age-appropriate.
  The third sentence acknowledges that children develop at their own pace, but developmental milestones provide a guideline.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is to provide specific guidance on setting age-appropriate expectations.
  The only option that does so is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text is discussing how to set expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The next step is likely to provide advice on how to set appropriate expectations.
  Option A talks about knowing the child's goals, and adjusting expectations a little for a more rigid definition of consequences.
  Option B talks about providing an example of how expectations can change as a child grows older.
  Option C discusses the need to research developmental milestones to evaluate expectations before going out.
  Option D talks about children changing and becoming more independent after a few years.
  Option C seems to be more related to the topic of developmental milestones and evaluating expectations, and fits better for the next step.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The paragraph discusses the importance of setting age-appropriate expectations for children's behavior in public.
  The paragraph also mentions that there are developmental milestones that provide a guideline for children's behavior.

  Choice B mentions using developmental milestones to provide an example of age-appropriate expectations.
  Choice C mentions doing research on developmental milestones to evaluate whether expectations are realistic.
  While both choices are relevant, choice B is more directly related to the idea presented in the text.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Starting a campfire
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A camp fire burns brightly in the night. the fire
Choices:
  A: dances and people watch it flame.
  B: slowly grows in size.
  C: is lighted from the inside up and put out behind an iron grill.
  D: rapidly spreads across the ground.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" is the most likely description of what people do when they gather around a burning campfire.
  The other options do not fit the context of the sentence.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  A campfire is a wood fire that people light for warmth and cooking.
  The sentence suggests that the campfire is already burning brightly in the night.
  The phrase "the fire" probably refers to the campfire mentioned in the first sentence.
  The options B, C, and D do not make sense because they all suggest that the campfire is being started again or is in the process of spreading.
  The phrase "dances and people watch it flame" makes sense because a campfire's flames are often described as "dancing" and people do indeed enjoy watching campfires.
  Therefore, the answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence starts with "the fire," indicating a continuation of the description of the fire itself.
  Option A describes the fire dancing while people watch, which is a good continuation of the imagery of a campfire in use.
  Option B might make sense, but it's not as consistent with the initial imagery as option A.
  Option C and D both seem unlikely, as the former involves an iron grill (which wasn't previously mentioned) and the latter describes the fire rapidly spreading across the ground (which is dangerous and not desirable when starting a campfire).
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text is describing a campfire.
  The phrase "burns brightly in the night" suggests that the fire is already burning.
  The phrase "the fire" suggests that the sentence is describing the fire itself.
  A campfire is used for warmth, cooking, and socializing.
  Answer A sounds like a reasonable completion for the text as watching the flames of a campfire can be a source of enjoyment.
  Answer B suggests that the fire grows slowly in size, but the text does not give us any information about the speed at which the fire grows.
  Answer C describes lighting a fire in a specific way that is not related to the earlier part of the text.
  Answer D suggests that the fire is spreading across the ground, but the text describes a fire that is already burning.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  A camp fire is a contained fire used for warmth, cooking, and enjoyment.
  The text suggests that the fire is already lit.
  The phrase "burns brightly" suggests that the fire is already going.
  The phrase "the fire" implies that the text is referring back to a fire that has already been introduced.
  Based on these observations, the most likely completion to the text is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a campfire burning brightly in the night.
  The next sentence should describe what happens to the campfire.
  Choice A fits the context of people watching the fire.
  Choice B contradicts the idea of a fire burning brightly.
  Choice C describes a different way of starting and stopping a fire, which is not relevant to the current sentence.
  Choice D contradicts the idea of a controlled campfire.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence is "dances and people watch it flame." 
  The answer is A: dances and people watch it flame.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  A campfire is usually a controlled fire in a pit or fire ring.
  A fire that is burning brightly in the night is likely to be an established fire.
  The phrase "the fire" indicates that the sentence is continuing the description of the fire.
  Option A describes the fire dancing and people watching it flame, which is a possible and likely scenario.
  Option B describes the fire growing in size but it is not likely based on the context given.
  Option C describes the process of lighting a fire, but the phrase "the fire burns brightly in the night" indicates that the fire has already been lit.
  Option D refers to a forest fire or wildfire, which is not the context of the sentence given.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the sentence would be option A: "dances and people watch it flame."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The first sentence describes a campfire burning brightly at night.
  The next sentence starts with "the fire" which implies that we should expect a description of how the fire is behaving or being maintained.
  The choice "dances and people watch it flame" seems to fit best as it describes a behavior of the fire (dancing) and the presence of people watching it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Since the text describes the campfire as burning brightly in the night, the fire is likely already burning and producing flames.
  Option A describes the flames dancing, which is a likely occurrence in a campfire.
  Option B might happen if more wood is added to the fire, but there is no indication of that in the text.
  Option C describes a method of starting and controlling a fire, but the text does not mention anything about an iron grill or lighting the fire from the inside up.
  Option D is unlikely since it suggests the campfire is out of control and spreading rapidly, which is dangerous.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: dances and people watch it flame. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that the campfire is already burning.
  The addition should describe what the fire is likely doing.
  Option A is unlikely because it describes people watching the flames, which is not a natural occurrence of a fire.
  Option B could be possible, but it does not provide much detail.
  Option C is possible, but it is very specific and may not apply to all situations.
  Option D is highly unlikely as a campfire spreading uncontrollably is dangerous.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is Option A: dances and people watch it flame.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
Further in the game the yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response. the yellow team
Choices:
  A: loses one goal and he walks away.
  B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
  C: continues playing and scoring a goal although they seem to be doing the same thing back and forth.
  D: better mark the match while they're still scoring.
Response 0:
Thought: 
   The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates with each other.
   This indicates that they are doing well in the game.
   It is also mentioned that they shake hands and clap each other's backs.
   The only choice that reflects a positive outcome is option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text describes a yellow team that earns another goal during a game.
  The sentence right after that talks about how the team celebrates.
  The word "briefly" suggests the celebration was quick.
  Only one of the answer choices describes a celebration that happens shortly after the yellow team earns another goal.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
The sentence states that the yellow team earned another goal. 
The yellow team clapped each other's back to celebrate their goal.
The next sentence should describe what happened after they celebrated their goal.
Option A doesn't make sense here because the yellow team just earned a goal and celebration.
Option B sounds plausible as the next sentence because it describes another celebration, but this time with hugs.
Option C doesn't sound right because it contradicts what happened earlier in the sentence.
Option D doesn't make sense in this context because it doesn't provide the information about what happened after the goal. 
Therefore, the answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
 The yellow team earns another goal and shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping each other's backs indicates they are celebrating their progress.
 The sentence "the yellow team" is incomplete and needs to be continued.
 Option A doesn't match their celebratory response and Option B matches the celebratory response and also provides the meaning to "yellow team".
 Option C is less likely since they are "scoring a goal" which contradicts with "the yellow team earns another goal".
 Option D doesn't make sense in the context given.
 The answer is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The statement is describing the team's reaction to the goal.
  We need to determine what happens next after the goal is scored.
  Option A doesn't describe a fitting reaction to the yellow team's goal.
  Option C implies that the yellow team continues scoring without any further celebration.
  Option D is unrelated to the situation described.
  Option B is the most likely completion to the text.
  Option B describes a celebratory reaction to a final goal.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The yellow team has already scored one goal earlier.
  They score another goal later in the game.
  The yellow team members celebrate their second goal briefly.
  None of the choices state that the yellow team loses the game or the match ends.
  Option B suggests that the yellow team scores a final goal and members hug each other in response. This is the most likely completion of the sentence.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text indicates that the yellow team scores a goal.
  The yellow team celebrates by briefly shaking hands with each other and clapping their backs.
  The question is asking what happens next, so the answer must describe the events after the yellow team scores their goal.
  Option A is unlikely because the text says that the yellow team earns "another goal", which means they already scored at least one before this.
  Option B is possible, but there is no indication that this is the final goal of the game.
  Option C is also possible, but it doesn't describe any new developments in the game.
  Option D does not make sense in the context of the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The yellow team earns another goal and celebrates briefly with each other.
  The phrase "shakes hands briefly with each other along with clapping their backs in celebratory response" indicates a positive response.
  The phrase "in celebratory response" means that they are responding positively to something.
  It is likely that they are responding to a goal they have earned.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that "the yellow team scores one final goal at which point the yellow uniformed team members hug each other in response."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes the yellow team earning another goal.
  The members of the yellow uniformed team clap each other's backs in celebratory response.
  This suggests that the yellow team is happy and may have won the game.
  Choice B says that the yellow team scores one final goal, at which point its members hug each other in response. This seems like a plausible completion to the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text talks about the yellow team earning another goal.
  They shake hands and clap each other's backs in a celebratory response.
  This implies that the yellow team is happy about something.
  The most reasonable response to their happiness would be that they scored a goal, as they are participating in a sport.
  The option B says that they score one final goal with the yellow uniformed team members hugging each other in response.
  Thus, the most fitting answer is B.

Response 1:
Thought:
  The text explains how to treat insect bites in toddlers.

  Option A doesn't make much sense as it uses terms like "bryls" and "kick" which don't seem to fit. It also mentions braiding to the back side of her head, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B doesn't seem to continue where the first sentence left off, talking about showing the braid while continuing to talk.
  Option C talks about a knotted hair area, clip, and flipped hair which are not mentioned in the text.
  Option D talks about instructions and supervision which are not mentioned in the text.
  Therefore, "None of the Above" seems to be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a woman lying on a bed and brushing her hair. 
  Then she takes a lock of hair from the front and braids it taking hair from the sides. 
  The sentence is incomplete and seems to be describing the next step of the process. 
  None of the options make sense as a completion to the text.
  Therefore, None of the Above is the answer.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
The sentence talks about a woman brushing her hair on the border of the bed, then taking a lock of front hair and braiding it by taking hair from sides. The next part of the sentence should describe what the woman does next in the process of braiding her hair. Option A mentions bryling the hair to the back side of her head, which is not a common technique for braiding. Option B mentions that the woman shows the braid while continuing to talk, however, it does not add any useful information to the sentence. Option C talks about starting with a knotted hair area, which is not mentioned in the previous sentence. Option D mentions supervising the braid, but there's no mention of anyone else being involved in this process. Thus, the most fitting completion to the given text is A, which talks about the woman pinning the braid in front and flipping her hair over her shoulders. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: The text describes a woman lying on a bed and braiding her hair. The sentence then abruptly ends with "then", indicating that there should be a follow-up action that describes what the woman does next. Looking at the choices, only option A seems to be a logical completion of the action, as it describes the woman completing the braid by securing it with a pin and positioning the hair on her shoulders. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes a woman lying on a bed and brushing her hair on the border of the bed. 
  Then, the woman takes a lock of front hair and braids it, taking hair from the sides.
  The text is suggesting that the woman is in the process of braiding her hair, so the correct answer should reflect that. 
  Option A seems unlikely because it mentions a "bryls" which is not a known word and the rest of the sentence is unclear.
  Option B doesn't provide any additional information about what happens after the woman begins to braid her hair so it is unlikely to be correct.
  Option C is confusing because it mentions a "knotted hair area," which is not mentioned earlier, and it is unclear what "close the flipped hair" means.
  Option D is also unclear in meaning and does not seem to provide a logical continuation to the text.
  Therefore, despite some grammatical errors, the most likely completion of the text is A, which describes the woman finishing the braid with a pin and moving her hair over her shoulders.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text is describing a woman braiding her hair.
  The sentence ends with "Then," indicating that the next sentence should describe another action taken by the woman.
  The only answer choice that describes a subsequent step in the hair braiding process is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The woman has already taken a lock of front hair and started braiding, so the sentence needs to complete the description of what she does after that.
  Option A describes a process that seems complicated and unclear.
  Option C describes a process that starts differently than the initial description, and doesn't make much sense.
  Option D seems to describe a process that doesn't fit with the situation.
  Option B is the most likely because it describes the woman showing the braid while continuing to talk.
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text describes a woman lying on a bed and brushing her hair.
  The woman then takes a lock of hair from the front and begins to braid it.
  The next sentence likely describes what she does after starting the braid.
  Choice A includes phrases like "bryls the hair" and "kick her hair," which do not make sense in this context.
  Choice C mentions "knotted hair area" and "large clip," which are not mentioned earlier in the text and do not make sense in this context.
  Choice D mentions "instructions and supervise," which also do not make sense in this context.
  Choice B is the only option that follows logically from the description of the woman braiding her hair.
  Therefore, the answer is B: ", the woman shows the braid while continues talking."

  The text is about how to highlight blonde hair naturally.
  The first step is to get good quality shampoo and conditioner and to wash hair thoroughly. These help prevent dry hair.
  The next step is to spray in some leave-in conditioner.
  The question is asking about the next step after spraying in the leave-in conditioner.
  Choice A talks about leaving the conditioner in for five minutes, then rinsing it out, but it does not mention anything about highlighting blonde hair.
  Choice B talks about putting lemon juice in a spray bottle and spraying all over the hair, but it can damage the hair and does not mention anything about highlighting blonde hair.
  Choice C talks about ensuring that the hair is completely dry before applying shampoo and conditioner and mentions the possible build up of dryness due to sun exposure. It does not mention anything about highlighting the hair.
  Choice D talks about how the hair will absorb vitamin C and the desired color and the importance of looking for shampoo that says "extract" and matches hair color. This choice seems more relevant to highlighting hair and mentions "extract" as a keyword, which could be a hint.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to choose D: Your hair will absorb vitamin C and the desired color when it has moisture, but it does not and over time produces "patchy" hair. Look for shampoo that says "extract" either and be sure it matches your hair color.

  Answer D talks about adding drops to replicate a scent, which is not relevant to the instructions given.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text is providing a guide on how to make a homemade ear cleaner.
  The first two steps are already mentioned: Get a small bottle and Fill the bottle with your chosen oil.
  This means that the most likely completion is another step that explains what to do next in the process.
  Out of the given choices, the only step that follows this pattern is option B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: [step] Use either mineral oil or olive oil. [substeps] Oil-based cleaners have the advantage of lubricating the ear canal.

Response 6:
Thought: 
  The first step is to get a small bottle.
  Then, the next step is to either get an ear dropper bottle or a small brown bottle with an eye-dropper cap.
  The missing information should be about filling the bottle.
  Looking at the choices, B makes the most sense as it suggests filling the bottle with either mineral or olive oil and explains the advantage of oil-based cleaners.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text is providing instructions for making a homemade ear cleaner, and it has already explained how to obtain an appropriate bottle.
  The next natural step would be to explain how to fill the bottle with the ear cleaning solution.

### Temperature: 9.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Camel ride
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
Two women are sitting on a small camel. the woman on the back of the camel
Choices:
  A: looks at her phone while the two women hold the camel down.
  B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  C: waves at the camera.
  D: is running and with other people walking alongside it.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text says that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The sentence is incomplete, so we need to use logic to figure out what seems most likely to happen next.
  It is not likely that the women are trying to hold the camel down.
  It is not likely that the woman on the back of the camel is running, with other people walking alongside it.
  It is not clear whether the women have a reason to wave at a camera.
  However, it is quite common for people to sit close to each other on a small camel.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
  The answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
   This text describes two women sitting on a small camel and one of them is on the back.
   None of the options describe a reason behind why they are holding the camel down or running.
   Option C describes a possible action taken by one of the women.
   Option A does not make sense.
   Option D describes a completely different scenario.
   Option B is possible because the two women are sitting on the camel.
   Therefore, the most likely completion is that the woman on the back starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  This text mentions that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is the one who is being described in the options.
  Option A is unlikely based on the fact that the two women are holding the camel down, implying that the camel might start moving if they let it go.
  Options B and D are also unlikely based on the information we have.
  Option C seems most likely, because it's a common pose for people who are taking pictures while riding on a camel.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:

  The text states that two women are sitting on a small camel and then describes one of the women.
  
  Option A is unlikely to be true, as it would be difficult to hold a camel down while riding it.
  
  Option B is possible, but the text would need to provide more information in order for us to confirm if it is correct or not.
  
  Option C is likely to be true, as people often wave at cameras when taking pictures, especially when riding animals such as camels.
  
  Option D sounds unlikely, as the text indicates that both women are sitting on the camel, not running alongside it.
  
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: waves at the camera.
  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The prompt states that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The text then specifies "the woman on the back of the camel".
  This implies that there is a woman on the front of the camel.
  Based on the choices, the most likely completion to the text is that the woman on the back of the camel is doing something while riding the camel.
  Since two of the choices involve physical action, and none of the previous text implies that the camel is moving, it is most likely that the woman on the back of the camel is not running or holding the camel down.
  The only choice left is C, that she waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text states that two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel is partially described but not fully. 
  She is most likely doing something similar to the woman on the front.
  It is unlikely that she is running and with other people walking alongside.
  Holding the camel down sounds unnecessary and unreasonable.
  Waving at the camera is a possible option.
  However, starting knee to knee with the woman on the front seems like the most likely and logical choice.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes two women sitting on a small camel.
  The text then mentions the "woman on the back of the camel".
  Out of the given choices, the most likely completion to the text could be an action that the woman on the back of the camel is doing.
  It is common for people to wave at cameras when taking a photo.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text could be "C: waves at the camera."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The two women are sitting on a small camel.
  The woman on the back of the camel has not been described in the sentence.
  It is a common practice to have someone walk alongside the animal to help ensure the safety of the riders.
  However, the woman on the back of the camel is not mentioned to be doing this task.
  It is reasonable to guess that the woman on the back may have a relaxed pose since holding the camel down isn't necessary.
  Option A is too unlikely because it is not sensible for someone to sit on a camel while looking at their phone.
  Option B is also unlikely because this is not a common position for people to have while riding a camel and it is not relevant to the situation described in the text.
  Option C seems like the most plausible answer since waving at a camera is a common behavior in a situation where a photo is being taken.
  Option D is not relevant to the situation described in the text.
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The sentence describes two women sitting on a small camel. 
  Then, it starts talking about the woman on the back of the camel.
  The part of the sentence that comes after "the woman on the back of the camel" should be something that describes what the woman is doing or her position.
  Looking at the choices, the most likely completion is C: waves at the camera.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question appears to describe a scene with two women sitting on a small camel.
  The second part of the question is asking what the woman on the back of the camel is doing.
  None of the answer choices describe the woman on the back of the camel holding the camel down.
  Looking at her phone seems unlikely since she is sitting on a small camel with another person.
  Running and walking are also unlikely since the question does not mention anyone else in the scene.
  That leaves two answer choices: B and C.
  It is possible that the woman on the back of the camel is waving at the camera.
  But it is more likely that the two women are sitting knee to knee as this is a common way to ride a small camel.
  The answer is B: starts knee to knee with the woman on the front.

  The text provides steps for getting a cute summer hairstyle.
  The first two steps involve washing and drying your hair.
  The third step mentions blow-drying your hair completely and using cool air to add shine.
  The most likely next step would involve styling your hair.
  Option A talks about gently brushing out tangles and sectioning hair, which seems like a plausible continuation based on the previous steps.
  Option B talks about fluffing hair with a comb, but it doesn't make sense to keep hair dry by wrapping an elastic band around a comb.
  Option C offers a dry shampoo and conditioner, which is not related to the steps outlined so far.
  Option D suggests a finished updo, which is not a continuation of the steps provided.
  Therefore, the answer is A: [title] Next, gently brush out tangles, starting at the ends and slowly working your way to the roots. [title] Section your hair into two parts-the top half and the bottom half.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:

  Choice A is the best answer because it completes the series of steps on achieving a cute summer hairstyle.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text is about how to get a cute summer hairstyle.
  The first two steps are related to washing and drying the hair after showering.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text will be something that follows the steps of washing and drying the hair.
  The only option that does that is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first sentence of the paragraph indicates that the text will explain how to get a cute summer hairstyle.
  The text follows up with instructions on how to prep hair in the shower and blow dry hair.
  Therefore, the most likely next step to getting a cute summer hairstyle would be to address hair styling or grooming.
  Options A, B, and D all mention at least one of these actions.
  Option C mentions a dry shampoo and conditioner, but it does not fit naturally for the flow of steps.
  Option A mentions sectioning hair and detangling, which are essential for a cute hairstyle, so it is the most likely next step in the process.
Action: Answer("A")

  The passage is about how to get a cute summer hairstyle.
  The first title talks about washing and conditioning hair in the shower.
  The second title talks about getting rid of excess water with a towel.

  The next instruction should be a continuation of the hairstyle process.
  Option A talks about brushing out tangles and sectioning hair into two parts which seems like a possible continuation.
  Option B and D are off-topic from the current discussion.
  Option C is an irrelevant and confusing instruction.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to recognize implantation bleeding [title] Consider the timing. [step] This type of bleeding during pregnancy usually occurs 6 to 12 days after conception--close to the time when the next menstrual cycle is expected. Ask yourself when was the last time you had sex.
Choices:
  A: [title] Determine if you started after being pregnant. [step] In some cases, the result of a feeding may be implantation bleeding; however, do not wait for the numbers to change.
  B: [title] Keep track of how much time or amount of time has passed since you last had sex. [step] Consider whether or not there was a fluctuation in energy during intercourse.
  C: If more than a month or two has passed, then it's unlikely that what you're seeing is implantation bleeding. [substeps] Since implantation bleeding may be confused with the normal menstrual cycle, some women are surprised to discover their pregnancy is a month further along than they originally estimated.
  D: Will the bleeding still be regular after that time? [title] Look for a red or brownish-gray rash. [step] The rash is a reddish-gray ring or a large wound, and it is usually five to six days after release of progesterone (the hormone that controls the menstrual cycle).

Topic: Playing lacrosse
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal. his team member
Choices:
  A: passes to another teammate, the sumo makes a goal and the blue team comes out of their seats.
  B: spins quickly to evade the ball and missed the goal by two feet.
  C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  D: fails the first time and he is called a loser.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The player is trying to hit the goal, so the next sentence should be about their shot.
  None of the answer choices mention a shot being taken.
  Answer choices A, B, and D all describe actions that are not related to the original sentence.
  The most likely completion is C, which describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The sentence describes a player from the blue team who is chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  It is most likely that a teammate of the blue team player is mentioned to continue the sentence.
  Answer A implies a successful goal, but it mentions a "sumo," which seems out of place.
  Answer B describes the player missing the goal by two feet, but it doesn't complete the sentence in context.
  Answer D is highly unlikely since it's aggressive language that is not typically used in a team sport.
  Answer C is a more likely continuation since it keeps the focus on the blue team players' efforts.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is "tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player."
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The blue team player aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  He is described as a "team member", which means he is not alone on the field.
  Therefore, the next part of the text should describe what the team member does next.
  Option A and D do not seem to be logical choices based on the context.
  Option B says that the team member misses the goal by two feet, but it is not clear if he even took the shot.
  Option C seems like the most likely choice as it describes what the team member is doing (trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player).
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: The first sentence describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with a lacrosse stick to hit a goal, indicating that the player is likely attempting to score a goal. The next part of the sentence mentions "his teammate," suggesting that the player may pass the ball to his teammate in order to help score a goal. Option A mentions passing the ball to another teammate, who then makes a goal and wins, which is consistent with the idea of teamwork and scoring a goal. Option B suggests that the player spins quickly to evade the ball but misses the goal by two feet, which is not consistent with scoring a goal. Option C suggests that the player tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is not consistent with the idea of scoring a goal. Option D suggests that the player fails to hit the goal the first time and is called a loser, which is not consistent with the idea of teamwork and supporting one's teammates.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The sentence mentions that a player chases the ball with his stick and tries to hit a goal. This implies that the player is attempting to score a goal for his team.
  The sentence also mentions "his team member." This suggests that the player may be passing the ball to a teammate to score the goal.
  Of the available choices, option A is the most likely completion that describes the blue team scoring a goal and being excited about the result.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
 The text states that a player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal. 
 It then goes on to mention "his team member." This indicates that the sentence is likely to continue with something that happens to or involves the teammate. 
 Option A talks about a sumo making a goal, which is unlikely and irrelevant. 
 Option B talks about the player spinning quickly, which doesn't fit with the previous sentence. 
 Option D is inappropriate and insulting. 
 Option C is likely the correct answer as it fits with the previous sentence. The teammate is likely trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
 Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes a player from the blue team chasing the ball with his lacrosse stick and trying to hit a goal.
  The logical completion to the text would be a statement about what his teammate does or what happens on the field.
  Option A describes a pass, a goal, and the blue team's reaction, but the text does not mention a sumo.
  Option B describes the player spinning and missing the goal.
  Option D describes the player failing and being called a loser, but the text does not mention this happening.
  Option C describes the player trying to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player, which is a logical completion of the text.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  A player from the blue team is trying to hit a goal in lacrosse.
  It is likely that his team member will do something after or in response to this action.
  Answer A does not seem to make sense because it mentions a sumo, which is not related to lacrosse, so it can be disregarded.
  Answer B is also unlikely because it mentions spinning, which is not a common technique in lacrosse.
  Answer D is derogatory and does not suit the tone of the text.
  Answer C makes sense because it is common for players to try to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
  Therefore, the answer is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  A player from the blue team aggressively chases the ball with his lacrosse stick and tries to hit a goal.
  Since the player is chasing the ball, it is more likely that he is trying to gain possession of the ball than trying to keep it away from the opponent team player.
  The phrase "his team member" suggests that the player is going to pass to another player.
  The first option describes a sumo making a goal, which is unlikely to happen in a lacrosse game.
  The fourth option does not seem likely, as it is not a good reflection of sportsmanship.
  The second option mentions that the player missed the goal, which could happen, but it is not a completion to the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is C: tries to follow the ball and keep it away from the opponent team player.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The player from the blue team is trying to hit a goal aggressively using his lacrosse stick.
  It is likely that his team member will make some move in response to the player's action.
  Option B seems to be irrelevant to the text and doesn't make any sense.
  Option D seems too harsh and unlikely to be the completion to the text.
  Option A seems too specific and doesn't really make sense either.

Choices:
  A: [title] Wash them first if they are caked with mud. [step] Either rinse them with a garden hose or put them through an entire washer cycle.
  B: Shoes could be permanently damaged if dirt and debris are not removed with the help of microbes. Typical finishes of shoes should be white and reasonably soft.
  C: Of course, if they aren't synthetic, place them into the washing machine with the proper temperature. [substeps] Avoid using steel wool or other aggressively abrasive laers, as these can damage the rubber soles of a properly-made pair of shoes.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and playing drums while doing a choreography.
  Behind the band, kids walking in circles are also doing a choreography.
  Based on the given information, there is no mention of a stage.
  The most likely completion to the sentence is that the kids are doing a choreography while walking in circles. 
  The option that best completes the text is B: walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around.

  A marching band is performing on the street wearing red uniforms and playing drums.
  Behind them, kids are walking in circles and doing a choreography.
  The keyword "behind" suggests that the kids are not performing with the marching band.
  Option A does not make sense because it describes the kids showing something side by side, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B talks about the kids walking down to the stage and standing around. However, the text does not mention any stage.
  Option D talks about the kids wandering around, which is not consistent with the idea of them doing a choreography.

The most likely completion to the text is "are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them."
Response 4:
Thought:
  The marching band is in the street playing drums and doing a choreography.
  Behind the band, kids walking in circles are doing a choreography.
  The options A and C are not likely because they say the kids are looking at the band, but the kids are doing their own choreography.
  The option D is not likely because it says the kids are wandering around, but the text says they are doing a choreography.
  The answer is B because it says the kids are walking down to the stage, which means they are not just wandering around. Also, the option mentions something different from what the band and kids are doing, which is standing around and doing handstands, which is a likely activity for the kids to be doing.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and playing drums while doing some choreography.
  Behind the band, there are kids walking in circles while doing a choreography as well.
  It is unlikely that the kids would be sitting on the sidewalk looking at them, as they are also doing a choreography.
  It is also unlikely that the kids would be wandering around in the street, as it would interfere with the performance.
  It is possible that the kids might show side by side shaking their hands, but it does not seem likely based on the context.
  Option B is somewhat confusing and does not make sense.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the kids are walking down to the stage holding hand stands on the stairs and just standing around.
  The answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  The text describes a marching band wearing red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography on a street.

  Option C describes the kids sitting on the sidewalk looking at them, which is plausible.
  Option D describes the kids wandering around in the street around him walking around, which is unrelated to the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the kids are sitting on the sidewalk looking at them.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a marching band wearing red uniforms playing drums and doing a choreography. 
  Behind the band, kids are walking in circles doing a choreography.
  Based on the context, it's most likely that the kids are also performing some kind of synchronized dance or movement.
  Therefore, option A "show side by side shaking their hands." is the most likely completion of the text.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The marching band is wearing red uniforms and playing drums in the street while performing choreography.
  There are kids walking in circles behind the band and also doing choreography.
  Given that they are performing and there is no mention of them sitting or wandering around, options C and D can be eliminated.
  Option A, "showing side by side while shaking their hands," doesn't fit the scene described.
  Option B, "walking down to the stage holding handstands on the stairs and just standing around," does not make sense in the context of the text.

Choices:
  A: lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
  B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
  C: lowers his arms and his hands up.
  D: fails, other times he is successful.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The man is training for a weightlifting event.
  He is filming himself lifting weights over his head.
  The sentence "sometimes he" implies that there are different outcomes.
  The options A, B, and C don't fit logically from the context.
  Therefore, D is the most likely completion.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Based on the description, the man is training for the weightlifting events in the olympics.
  The description says he picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  The phrase "sometimes he" implies that he alternates between two things.
  The last choice says he fails or succeeds which might be likely given that he is training.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that "sometimes he fails, other times he is successful."
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  A man shows a video of himself training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  Several times, he picks up weight and lifts it over his head.
  There are two options for the next sentence: either he is successful or he fails.
  The choice D says that he fails and other times he is successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The man lifts weights over his head several times.
  The next sentence starts with "sometimes," implying that the man's lifting results vary.
  Choice A doesn't make sense because it says the man lifts so far he is dragged to the ground.
  Choice B is also unlikely because it doesn't make sense in the context of weightlifting to put a weight down before lifting it over one's head.
  Choice C is unlikely because lowering one's arms and hands up isn't a common weightlifting technique.
  Choice D is the most likely because it follows logically from the information provided.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text mentions that the man is training for the weightlifting events in the Olympics.
  The text mentions that sometimes the man is successful and other times he fails.
  The text does not mention anything about the man being dragged to the ground.
  The text mentions that the man lifts the weight above his head.
  The text mentions that the man's friends record him.
  It is likely that the man puts down the weight before he raises it above his head while his friends record it.
  The answer is B: put it down to raise it above his head while his friends record it.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The man in the video is training for a weightlifting event.
  Several times he picks up weight and lifts it over his head.
  The next sentence should indicate what happens when he lifts the weight over his head.
  Option A does not make sense because it is unlikely that the man would be dragged to the ground.
  Option B is also unlikely because lifting the weight over his head would require him to put it down and then lift it up again.
  Option C makes grammatical sense but does not describe what happens when he lifts the weight.
  Option D seems like the most likely option because it says that he fails sometimes but is successful other times, which is a common experience when weightlifting.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The man is training for weightlifting events in the Olympics and is shown lifting weights over his head.
  It's unlikely he would be dragged to the ground because it would mean he's not in control of the weight he's lifting.
  There is no mention of anyone helping the man lift the weights, so it's unlikely he's putting the weight down to raise it above his head.
  Lowering his arms and hands up doesn't make sense and isn't a logical completion to the text.
  From the context, it seems likely that the man is attempting to lift weights multiple times and is sometimes not successful.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes a man training for weightlifting events.
  The man picks up weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  Four possible options are given to describe what happens after the man lifts the weight.
  Option A does not make sense because it is unlikely that a person lifts so far that they are dragged to the ground.
  Option B is also unlikely because it suggests the man puts the weight back down before lifting it above his head.
  Option C is not a logical completion to the text since it suggests that the man lowers his arms instead of lifting weight.
  Option D is the most logical completion because it suggests that the man is sometimes successful and sometimes fails in his attempts to lift the weight.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fails, other times he is successful.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: The text describes a man training for the weightlifting events, and shows him lifting weight several times. The sentence "sometimes he" introduces what happens next. The options provided are all plausible outcomes of weightlifting. However, option D is the most likely answer as it suggests that sometimes he succeeds and other times he fails, which is a common situation in weightlifting. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The man is training for the weightlifting events in the olympics.
  The text mentions he picks up the weight and lifts it over his head several times.
  The word "sometimes" indicates there are different outcomes each time.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: fails, other times he is successful.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to ripen a cantaloupe [title] Check the cantaloupe once the color changes. [step] Never harvest a cantaloupe when the outer rind is still green, since these melons are undoubtedly unripe. Once the cantaloupe changes to a tan or yellow color, though, it is probably ripe.
Choices:
  A: [title] Place the cantaloupe in a container for ripeness. [step] Placing your cantaloupe on its side will produce ripeness.
  B: [substeps] If the cantaloupe has very dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots, it is ripe. If the spots appear darker, or have a splotchy look to them, it may be ripe.
  C: If the cantaloupe turns a light brown after you slice it, or stays green, it is ripe. [title] Place the cantaloupe on the cutting board with its skin facing down.

  The most reasonable completion explains how to ripen a cantaloupe based on its color changing.
  Choice A mentions placing the cantaloupe in a container, but does not explain how this ripens the cantaloupe.
  Choice B talks about dark spots, but it is not clear how this helps ripen a cantaloupe.
  Choice C talks about a light brown color after slicing, which is not very useful when trying to ripen a whole cantaloupe.
  Choice D, on the other hand, explains that a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet, which suggests there may be additional steps to ripen it.
  Therefore the answer is D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Response 8:
Thought:
  The question asks for the most likely completion to the text.
  The text starts with a header that says "How to ripen a cantaloupe".
  The first step is to check the color of the cantaloupe. If it is green, it is unripe. If it has turned a tan or yellow color, it is probably ripe.
  The text does not mention putting the cantaloupe in a container or on its side, so option A is unlikely.
  Option B talks about dark spots, blackheads, and splotchy looks, which is not in line with what is mentioned in the first step of the text.
  Option C talks about slicing the cantaloupe and the color it turns once sliced. The text is not about slicing the cantaloupe, so this option is also unlikely.
  Option D says that a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet, which is in line with the first step of the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: [substeps] Do not harvest the cantaloupe based solely on color, though. While a green cantaloupe is definitely unripe, a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The passage is discussing how to ripen a cantaloupe.
  The step mentioned in the passage suggests checking the cantaloupe when it changes color to tan or yellow since it is probably ripe.
  There is no mention of placing the cantaloupe in a container or on its side to produce ripeness, so option A can be eliminated.
  Option B mentions dark spots, blackheads, or dark spots to determine ripeness, but this is not mentioned in the passage so it can also be eliminated.
  Option C talks about slicing the cantaloupe and looking for light brown color, but this is not mentioned either.
  The passage does mention that one should not rely solely on color, so the most likely completion to the passage is that while a yellow or tan cantaloupe may not be quite ripe yet.

  Therefore, answer choice C is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes a person putting bacon into a pan.
  The person's action suggests that they are cooking something.
  The most likely continuation is for the person to continue cooking the bacon.
  Option A describes additional actions that are not related to cooking bacon.
  Option B describes cooking cheese on bread, which is not related to cooking bacon in the pan.
  Option C is the most likely completion as it suggests cooking bacon and cheese together in the pan.
  Option D is not related to cooking bacon in the pan.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a person putting bacon into a pan.
  To make a sandwich, the person needs to prepare the bread and other ingredients.
  Choice A seems to describe a scrambled egg dish with cheese and bacon, not a sandwich.
  Choice B does not mention bread, so it is unlikely.
  Choice C is possible, but it does not mention anything else needed for a sandwich.
  Choice D describes a person preparing bread and various ingredients to make a sandwich, which is consistent with the question.
  Therefore, the answer is D: then cuts up vegetables and butters bread before putting various ingredients on the bread to make a sandwich.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The information given only mentions bacon being cooked in a pan.
  Option A describes frying cheese and putting it in an egg pan, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option B describes using a skillet to melt cheese onto bread, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option C describes slicing cheese and bacon together, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option D describes cutting up vegetables and assembling a sandwich, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Therefore, none of the options provided seem to be a likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The question refers to making a sandwich.
  None of the choices mention putting the ingredients onto bread to make a sandwich.
  The most likely choice is B: uses a skillet to melt out cheese onto bread.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Based on the information, the person puts bacon in the pan; hence the bacon is cooking.
  The question is asking what happens after that.
  None of the options mention anything about the bacon, so we need to assume that the bacon is still being cooked.
  Option A mentions frying cheese, which isn't mentioned in the original text, and then putting it in an egg pan, which contradicts the previous statement. So, it is not a likely option.
  Option C mentions cheese, which is mentioned in the original text. So, we'll keep this option as a possibility. 
  Option D mentions cutting up vegetables and buttering bread, which has nothing to do with the original text. So, it is not a likely option.
  Option B mentions using a skillet to melt out cheese onto bread, which is not mentioned in the original text. So, it is not a likely option.
  Therefore, Option C is the most likely completion to the text as it seems to follow the original text: putting bacon in a pan and then slicing cheese and bacon together.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The question is asking what will most likely happen after the person puts bacon into a pan.
  The options given are:
    frying cheese and putting it an egg pan
    melting cheese onto bread with a skillet
    slicing cheese and bacon together
    cutting up vegetables, buttering bread and making a sandwich with the ingredients
  Out of the given options, B: Using a skillet to melt out cheese onto bread seems to be the most likely completion of the text based on the image shown.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The prompt mentions bacon being put into a pan.
  The wording suggests that the person is cooking the bacon.
  Option A mentions frying cheese and putting it in an egg pan, which does not follow from the prompt.
  Option B mentions using a skillet to melt cheese onto bread, which does not follow from the prompt.
  Option C mentions slicing cheese and bacon together, which does not make sense as they are different textures.
  Option D mentions cutting vegetables and buttering bread, neither of which are mentioned in the prompt.
  Therefore, none of the options seems to provide a logical completion.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The person is putting bacon into a pan which indicates a cooking process.
  The next step is likely to involve cooking or preparing another ingredient before assembling a sandwich.
  None of the choices indicate the person is making a sandwich, so A and D can be eliminated.
  B involves melting cheese onto bread, which is not indicated to be a part of the process.
  C involves slicing cheese and bacon together, which is a possibility, but not necessary.
  Therefore, C is the most likely completion to the text.

  Choice C seems the most likely because it suggests that others are gathered around to watch and help.
  The most likely completion is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole, while others are doing something.
  Option A says they are capturing the fish that he caught. However, the text only mentions the person reeling in the fishing pole, not that he has actually caught a fish. This option is not likely.
  Option B talks about people in the water, but it is unclear what they are doing. This does not make sense given the context provided. This option is not likely.
  Option C suggests that people are kneeling around him as he continues to reel. This seems reasonable as it complements the image of a person reeling in a fishing pole. This option is likely.
  Option D talks about people watching a calf being released. This does not make any sense in the context of the text or the image provided. This option is not likely.
  
Action: Answer("C")

  Option C describes others kneeling around the person, which could be likely as they may be interested in seeing what has been caught.
  Option D talks about others watching a calf being released, which is not relevant to the context of the text.
  Therefore, the answer is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
The text describes a fishing pole being reeled in. 
The choices that include other people seem more likely.
Option A mentions people capturing fish in the area, but there is no mention of fish being caught yet. 
Option B mentions people in the water, which doesn't seem likely for an ice fishing scenario.
Option D mentions a calf being released, which is not related to the scenario.
Option C mentions people kneeling, which could be possible, as it's common for ice fishers to work in groups.
Therefore, the most likely completion is C: kneel around him as he continues to reel.

  The text describes a person reeling in a fishing pole.
  Others are mentioned, so there must be more than one person involved.
  Based on common fishing practices, it is likely that others are helping to capture the fish or are waiting to see it.
  Choice A is unlikely because it would be difficult for multiple people to be capturing the same fish.
  Choice B is unlikely because it does not make sense for people to be in the water while a fish is being reeled in.
  Choice C is the most likely because it is likely that others would be close by and watching as a fish is being reeled in.
  Choice D is unlikely because it mentions a calf, which is not related to the fishing activity.

  C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall.
  D: runs towards the weight as the others fall with the weight and watch him drop down.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text says that one of the body builders lifts the weight bar several times and then drops it down while the other two body builders watch him.
  The text is describing the "clean and jerk" weightlifting exercise.
  The "jerk" part of the exercise involves lifting the weight bar above the head, which then requires the lifter to drop the weight bar down to the floor.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the body builder completes the "jerk" part of the exercise and drops the weight bar down to the floor.
  The answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar and then dropping it.
  The options describe what the bodybuilder does next.
  Option A mentions lifting the weight bar again after wiping off sweat.
  Option B describes the bodybuilder dropping both the weight bar and the beam he was holding.
  Option C describes the bodybuilder continuing to lift for a couple of seconds and then dropping it, causing the other bodybuilders to fall.
  Option D describes the bodybuilder running towards the weight as the others fall with the weight.
  None of the options stand out as making the most sense in relation to the text.
  Given the context of the scenario, the most likely completion is that the bodybuilder prepares for another lift.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The text describes one bodybuilder lifting the weight bar several times and then dropping it while the other two watch.
  The next action is expected to be what he does after dropping the weight bar.
  The most likely answer is that he does some action related to the weight bar or other related equipment.
  Option A seems to be a likely continuation as it mentions the bodybuilder lifting the weight bar again.
  Option B mentions dropping the beam, which is not mentioned in the text.
  Option C mentions the bodybuilders falling, which is also not mentioned in the text.
  Option D mentions the others falling, which is also not mentioned in the text.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a weight bar being lifted several times and then dropped.
  The options are all different outcomes that might follow this event.
  Option A seems like it could be a logical response, as the bodybuilder might want to wipe off their sweat before trying to lift again.
  Option B involves dropping the beam, which is not mentioned in the text and does not seem likely.
  Option C is highly unlikely and physically dangerous, as the body builders would not fall from a weight being dropped.
  Option D is also very unlikely, and it is unclear why the other body builders would fall.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text implies that the body builder completed a lift and then dropped the weight bar.
  The options describe what the body builder does after dropping the weight bar.
  Option A mentions wiping off sweat and then lifting the weight again. This seems likely as body builders often wipe off sweat to maintain a good grip.
  Option B is unlikely as it mentions a beam which was not described in the original text.
  Option C seems unlikely as it mentions the body builders falling, which wasn't described in the original text, and it doesn't make sense for them to fall.
  Option D is also unlikely as it mentions the body builders falling and it doesn't make sense for them to fall.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the body builder goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
  The answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text describes a bodybuilder lifting a weight bar several times and then dropping it while two others watch him.
  The phrase "then he" indicates that the sentence describes what the bodybuilder does next.
  None of the choices from A to D accurately describe what the bodybuilder does next.
  Therefore, none of the above options fit the completion of the text.
  The correct answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text talks about one body builder lifting the weight bar several times and dropping it down.
  The sentence "then he" suggests that the expected next event should be a continuation of what the body builder does next.
  Choice A describes the body builder wiping off his sweat with a towel before lifting the weight bar again and dropping it. There is no mention of the body builder wiping off any sweat, and the description is incomplete.
  Choice C states that the body builder continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it, and the body builders fall. This is not consistent with the previous description of the body builders simply watching him.
  Choice D is nonsensical and does not relate to the previous events.
  Choice B describes the body builder releasing the weight bar and the beam and dropping it down near the floor. This best matches the previous description in the text.
  Therefore, the answer is B: releases the weight bar, as well as the beam he was holding, and drops it down near the floor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The given text describes a bodybuilder lifting and dropping a weight bar while two others are watching him.
  The sentence begins with "then he," which suggests a continuation of the action described.
  Among the answer choices, option A is about wiping off sweat and lifting the weight again, which is irrelevant and not mentioned in the given text.
  Option B talks about dropping a beam, which is not mentioned either.
  Option D talks about running and other bodybuilders falling, which is not mentioned and does not make sense in the context.
  Option C talks about lifting for another couple of seconds and then dropping it, which seems like the most appropriate completion of the given text.
  Therefore, the answer is C: continues to lift for another couple of seconds and then drops it and the body builders fall.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The passage describes a man lifting a weight bar and dropping it while others watch him.
  After dropping the weight bar, the passage suggests that he will continue lifting it.
  Answer A describes him wiping off his sweat, which is plausible, but it does not mention him lifting the bar again.
  Answer C suggests that the bodybuilders fall, which is not supported by the passage.
  Answer D is not supported by the passage.
  Answer B assumes that the bodybuilder was holding a beam, which was not mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it is not a likely completion.
  The most likely completion to the passage is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text describes a weight bar being lifted and then dropped down while two other body builders watch.
  None of the answer choices seem to accurately describe what happens after the weight bar is dropped.
  Option C does not make sense as the bodybuilders would not fall from the weight bar being dropped.
  Option D suggests the bodybuilders are falling, which is not described in the text.
  Option A seems to be the most logical and likely choice given the context of the text.
  Therefore, the answer is A: goes and wipes off his sweat with a towel and lifts the weight bar again and drops it.

Response 1:
Thought:
  The question describes a man cleaning snow from his car.
  The next sentence should be related to the man's actions.

  Therefore, I will choose the most likely answer which is the choice that talks about the building behind the car.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a man cleaning snow from his car.
  The completion should be something that follows from the previous sentence and provides more information.
  Since the man cleans the snow under his windshield wipers, the completion is likely to be related to this action.
  Option A mentions a garage and a boat, which are unrelated to the man's current action and location.
  Option B mentions a building behind the car, which could be likely, but doesn't provide any specific information about the man's action.
  Option C mentions zooming in on a cabin, which is not mentioned in the previous sentence and is also unrelated to the man's location.
  Option D mentions the man's car gliding by in the background, which is not likely since the man is currently cleaning snow from his car and therefore not driving it.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is B: see the building behind the car.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The man is cleaning snow from his car.
  The text mentions the man cleaning snow under his windshield wipers.
  The text does not provide any information about other things in the scene, such as a garage, a boat, a building, or a cabin.

  The man is cleaning snow from his car in the driveway.
  The choices do not relate to cleaning snow from a car or driveway.
  Therefore, none of the choices fit the information presented in the text.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text states that the man is cleaning snow from his car.
  The next sentence starts with "we", which suggests that the following sentence will describe something the viewers see related to the man cleaning snow off his car.
  None of the choices mention something related to removing snow/ice, except for "see the building behind the car", which is likely the most relevant choice as the driveway and the man's car are in front of the building.
  The other choices do not make sense given the context of the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The man is cleaning snow from his car, so he is likely preparing to drive it.
  The question is asking about what we are likely to see next in the text.

  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above."
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The text describes a man clearing snow from his car.
  There is no mention of a boat, water, or a cabin, so options A and C can be eliminated.
  Also, there is no evidence of the man's car moving, so option D can be eliminated.
  Option B makes sense because it describes what we see behind the car.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The question asks for the most likely completion to the text.

  In choice C, it suggests to add in some foundation which will give the bb cream its color.
  Therefore, the correct answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The text is about making blemish balm (bb cream).
  The first thing to do is gather everything listed in the things needed section.
  Then, pump in about 5 to 10 squirts of moisturizer into your container.
  The next step is to adjust the amount of moisturizer you add depending on how much bb cream you're making and how moisturizing you want it to be.
  The text also mentions adding essential oils or sunscreen or foundation, but only one of these options completes the text logically.
  Adding essential oil would give it fragrance but is not necessary for making bb cream.
  Adding non-stick spray is not mentioned in the text and is not necessary for making bb cream.
  Adding sunscreen is mentioned but it is not clear if sunscreen is an essential ingredient for making bb cream.
  Adding foundation is mentioned, and it is clear that adding foundation will give the bb cream its color.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is to add foundation.
  The answer is C: [title] Bb creams have sunscreen protection in them usually, so squirt a little of your favorite sunscreen into the jar. [title] Add in some foundation! [step] This will give your bb cream its color.

  Among all the choices only the option C mentions adding sunscreen protection, which is a necessary step in making blemish balm (bb cream).
Action: Answer("C")

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes two volunteers speaking to the camera.
  There is no indication that they are preparing to shovel snow or play with a ball.
  The most likely completion to the text would involve them doing something related to the field they are in.
  Cutting the grass or mowing the field is a likely activity.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: then demonstrate using the mowing equipment.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text mentions Irene Zimmerman and Zeek Compton, but doesn't provide any further context.

  Option A states that they demonstrate using the mowing equipment, which would fit well with the context.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The topic is cutting grass.
  The volunteer's names are mentioned but nothing else suggests what they will do.
  Option A suggests that they will demonstrate the mowing equipment, which aligns with the topic.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The topic is "Cutting the grass".
  The incomplete text mentions two volunteers speaking to the camera in a field.

  A likely possibility is that the volunteers would demonstrate how to cut the grass in the field.
  Therefore, the answer is A: then demonstrate using the mowing equipment.

Response 6:
Thought:
    The text mentions that Irene Zimmerman and Zeek Compton are volunteers.

Choices:
  A: begin trying to help the woman as the man is cut up on car.
  B: smile at her and compliment her.
  C: are walking around with tubes on the ground and getting ready to wind down.
  D: are captured in a white room playing the harmonica.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes a woman playing her harmonica inside an elevator.
  A person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  This person and the others are probably responding to an emergency situation.
  There is nothing in the text that indicates the woman's harmonica playing has anything to do with the situation.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the person and others in the elevator smile at her and compliment her.
  The answer is B: smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Based on the context given, the woman on the elevator is playing her harmonica while people continue to enter and exit the elevator.
  A man on a stretcher, along with some other people, enters the elevator.
  The prompt doesn't provide any indication of the man's condition or why he's on a stretcher.
  Therefore, choice A, which suggests that the man is cut up from a car accident and people are trying to help him, doesn't seem likely.
  Choice C is also not related to the context provided.
  Choice D doesn't make sense as there is no indication that anything like that is happening.
  Choice B seems most likely as the people entering the elevator are not directly interacting with the woman playing the harmonica, but rather just walking by. A smile and compliment would be the most appropriate response in this situation.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The woman in the elevator is playing a harmonica.
  A person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  Given the context, it is unlikely that the people on the elevator would begin trying to help the woman as the man is cut up on car.
  It is also unlikely that they are captured in a white room playing the harmonica.
  Option C does not make any sense here.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is that the people smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text describes a woman playing her harmonica in an elevator.
  Later, a person enters the elevator along with a man on a stretcher and some others.
  Based on the context, it is likely that the people will react in some way to the woman playing her harmonica.
  Option A does not seem likely as it describes a different situation.
  Option C sounds unrelated to the context.
  Option D is not related to the context either.
  Option B seems to be a polite and likely reaction to the situation described.
  Therefore, the answer is B: smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The sentence describes an action of a person playing the harmonica in an elevator.
  The next sentence describes an event of a person entering the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  The event does not imply that the person entering the elevator is related to the woman playing the harmonica.
  Given that, smiling and complimenting her is the most likely scenario.
  Therefore, the answer is B: smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text is about a woman playing her harmonica in an elevator where people keep getting on and off.
  Suddenly, a person enters with a man on a stretcher and some others.
  It is not clear what the people do.
  So, we need to find the most suitable action from the given answer choices.
  Option A seems unrelated to the context in the text.
  Option C seems unrelated to the text context.
  Option D is unrelated to the text context.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the people smile at her and compliment her, which is option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text describes a situation where a person is playing her harmonica in an elevator where people are getting on and off.
  A person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  The sentence is incomplete and is expecting some next action from the people entering the elevator.
  It is unlikely that the people start trying to help the woman as there is no indication of any issue.
  It is likely that the people will smile at her and compliment her.
  Therefore, the answer is B: smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The sentence states that a person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people. 
  The sentence does not mention any immediate danger or the need for medical attention.
  The woman is playing her harmonica, implying that she is not concerned or responding to the new entries.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the people smile at her and compliment her.
  The answer is B: smile at her and compliment her.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text says "People continue to get on and off the elevator but she continues to play her harmonica".
  This indicates that the woman is not easily distracted from playing her harmonica.
  A person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  None of the choices seem like a logical completion to the text.
  Choice A introduces an unrelated event, and the man being cut up on a car is not mentioned in the text.
  Choice B seems unlikely as the woman is playing a harmonica despite people getting on and off the elevator.
  Choice C is also unrelated to the text.
  Choice D appears to be a non-sequitur.
  Since none of the choices seem appropriate, the most likely completion to the text is "None of the above".
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The woman is playing her harmonica even though people are getting on and off the elevator.
  Another person enters the elevator with a man on a stretcher along with some other people.
  The options A and C seem unlikely because there is no evidence to suggest that the man on a stretcher is cut up on a car or that the people are getting ready to wind down.
  Option D seems irrelevant as there is no mention of a white room.
  Option B seems like a polite and appropriate response to the woman playing the harmonica.

  C: puts a large beige colored pitcher of water and pours the mixture into a pink pitcher of lemonade using a lime and other ingredients from an outdoor outdoor kitchen.
  D: fiddles with a little glass mixing bowl so she can mix everything else in.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text describes a series of steps for making a cake.
  The last step mentions that "she" needs to do something else.
  The pronoun "she" refers to the person mentioned earlier in the text, so it is reasonable to assume that "she" is continuing to make the cake.
  The most logical step to follow is to add more ingredients to the mixture before baking the cake.
  The only choice that describes additional ingredients being added is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all-purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: The text describes the mixing of milk and lemon juice after sugar. It then likely goes on to describe the next step in the process of making a cake. Option B appears to complete the text in a way that is related to cake-making. Option A, C and D seem unrelated to cake-making. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The sentence talks about adding milk and lemon juice.
  Next, something needs to be added to the mixture.
  Option B mentions the addition of vanilla extract, flour, cocoa powder, and salt, which seems to match the typical ingredients for making a cake.
  Therefore, the most likely completion of the text is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The text mentions that she mixes the sugar until it dissolves, and he adds milk and lemon juice.
  The next step should be related to mixing or adding more ingredients to what they have so far.
  Option B mentions adding vanilla extract and mixing everything up, which makes sense.
  Option A and C are completely unrelated and not relevant to the text.
  Option D mentions fiddling with a small glass mixing bowl, which is not described in the previous sentences.
  Therefore, the answer is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The first sentence mentions adding milk and lemon juice.
  The second sentence should logically follow from the first step and continue with the recipe.
  Option B includes the addition of vanilla extract, flour, cocoa powder, and salt, which would make sense as the next steps in a cake recipe.
  The other options seem unrelated and do not make sense in the context of a cake recipe.
  Therefore, the answer is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The first sentence talks about mixing sugar until it dissolves, add milk and lemon juice.
  The next sentence should talk about what comes next in the process of making a cake.
  Option A talks about drawing on a plate of food which is unrelated to making a cake.
  Option C talks about putting the mixture in a pitcher of lemonade which is unrelated to making a cake.
  Option D talks about fiddling with a little glass mixing bowl which is partially related to making a cake, but doesn't complete the process described in the previous sentence.
  Option B talks about adding vanilla extract, flour, cocoa powder, and salt which are all ingredients used to make a cake and completes the process described in the previous sentence.
  Therefore, the answer is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The first sentence states that the person mixes sugar until it dissolves and adds milk and lemon juice. 
  The next step would be to mix all the ingredients together to make the cake batter. 
  Option B is the most likely completion as it mentions adding vanilla extract, flour, cocoa powder and salt, which are common ingredients used in cake batter. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text describes the mixing of sugar and milk.
  Then two teaspoons of lemon juice are added.
  Starting the next sentence with "next" implies that a logical sequence of actions is being followed.
  The most logical next step in making a cake would be to add the dry ingredients as described in option B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The text describes the process of making a cake.
  The previous sentence mentions adding milk and lemon juice.
  The next step in making a cake is usually adding other wet ingredients, such as vanilla extract.
  After that, dry ingredients such as flour and cocoa powder are added.
  Therefore, the best answer is B: adds 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract and she mixes everything up, then she adds 1 1/4 cups of all purpose flour along with 1/4 cup of unsweetened cocoa powder and salt.

Response 9:
Thought:
  The text provides a list of ingredients and actions taken with them in a recipe.

  The choice that provides information most relevant to identifying rosemary is A. 
  A describes another form of rosemary and how to identify it.
  B is about measuring rosemary using a broom, which is not helpful for identification.

  D: lands on a mat behind her.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The text is describing a girl running down a track in slow motion, then taking a huge jump and hurling herself over a bar.
  The text does not mention anything about her landing on any type of surface.
  However, since high jump is a sport that involves jumping over a bar, it is highly likely that the girl landed on some type of mat to cushion her fall.
  Choice A suggests that the girl landed on a mat and marked her score.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a girl running down a track in slow motion.
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  Given the context, it is likely that she is performing a high jump.
  High jumpers land on a mat, so the most likely completion is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The passage describes a girl taking a huge jump over a bar.
  The most likely outcome after taking the jump and clearing the bar is landing on a mat to signify a successful attempt.
  The girl is shown running and jumping in slow motion, so the next likely action would be to land on a mat and score.
  Therefore, the answer is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
This text describes a girl who is running and jumping over a bar. We are given information about how this is done in "slow motion". 
The text does not provide information about a competition, so it is unlikely she is being scored.
Option B is not necessary because we have already been told that she is doing it in slow motion.
Option C is unlikely because landing on the grass could be dangerous.
Option D does not make sense- if she lands behind the mat, she would have fallen short of where she was supposed to land.
Therefore, the most logical completion is that she lands safely on a mat.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The text describes a girl running down a track and taking a huge jump to hurl herself over a bar. 
  The event described is high jump competition.
  In high jump, a bar is placed at a certain height, and the athlete jumps over the bar and lands on a mat.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is "lands on a mat." 
  Choice A is plausible but does not specify the exact outcome of the girl's attempt.
  Choice B is unlikely because the text already describes the attempt in slow motion.
  Choice C is unlikely because high jump competitions are usually held on a track and field surface, not on grass.
  Choice D is unlikely because the mat is usually placed in front of the bar, not behind it.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The sentence mentions "a bar" which implies that it is about the high jump competition in athletics.
  The sentence also mentions "mat", which is where participants land after completing the high jump.
  This information indicates that the most likely completion to the text would be "lands on a mat".
  Therefore, the answer is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The completion should describe what happens after she jumps.
  Option A states she marks her dark score. This option does not make sense in the context of the text.
  Option B says she performs the act again in slow motion. This option does not provide information on what happened after she jumped.
  Option C says she lands on the grass with her arms outstretched. This option does not make sense because high jump competitions usually have mats to soften the fall.
  Option D says she lands on a mat behind her. This option is logical because high jump competitions usually require the use of mats.
  Therefore, the answer is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
The text states that the girl takes a huge jump, hurling herself over a bar. 
Since she is participating in high jump, it is likely that she will land on a mat.
Option A talks about landing on a mat, so it is a likely completion to the text.
Therefore, the answer is A: lands on a mat, marking her dark score.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The completion should describe what happens after she goes over the bar.
  Option A suggests she scores darkly, but there's not enough context to understand what that means.
  Option B suggests she repeats the action, which is unlikely as she already completed the jump.
  Option C suggests she lands on grass with her arms outstretched, but it's unclear if there is even grass in the area.
  Option D suggests she lands on a mat behind her, which is a common way for high jump competitions to be scored.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is D: lands on a mat behind her.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The text describes a high jump in slow motion.
  The girl takes a huge jump and hurls herself over a bar.
  The most likely continuation is to show what happens after the girl completes the jump.
  Option A suggests she lands on a mat marking her score, but this does not fully complete the story.
  Option B suggests the act is shown again in slow motion, but this doesn't fully complete the story.
  Option C suggests the girl lands on the grass with her outstretched arms, but this is not a typical or safe landing for a high jump.
  Option D suggests that the girl lands on a mat behind her, which is the most common and safe landing for a high jump.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D: lands on a mat behind her.

  The next step should offer instructions on how to double the recipe, which could be achieved by multiplying the amounts of each ingredient by 2. 
  Answers A, B, and D do not provide a logical or feasible process to double a recipe.
  Answer C talks about a target circle and gives a measurement range, but this is not relevant to doubling a recipe.
  Therefore, None of the above is a likely completion.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The text is on how to double a recipe.
  The first step advises writing out the amounts of each ingredient needed ahead of time, rather than trying to do it in your head.
  Choice A provides a clear substep related to writing out the recipe.
  Choice B's substeps don't seem related to doubling a recipe.
  Choice C isn't related to the topic of doubling a recipe at all.
  Choice D's substeps are unclear and don't relate to doubling a recipe.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is A: If you have a copier, you may want to copy the original recipe and write in the margins, so that you have the instructions next to the ingredients. [title] Write down all of the vegetables, flour and meat products in 1 column.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
The question asks about how to double a recipe.
The second sentence recommends that you write out the amounts you need ahead of time.
Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would provide additional steps to follow after writing out the amounts.
Choice B talks about producing a detailed ingredient chart and adding a hacksaw; this is not helpful for doubling a recipe and is irrelevant.
Choice C discusses having a thin target circle in your head and creating a more balanced meal; this is not related to doubling a recipe and is irrelevant.
Choice D talks about choosing a single side of the recipe and writing out the quantity in a certain order; this is not a helpful step for doubling a recipe.
Choice A discusses copying the original recipe and writing the amounts next to the ingredients; this is helpful for doubling a recipe.
Therefore, the answer is A: [substeps] If you have a copier, you may want to copy the original recipe and write in the margins, so that you have the instructions next to the ingredients. [title] Write down all of the vegetables, flour and meat products in 1 column.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The text is about how to double a recipe.
  The step mentioned in the text recommends writing out the amounts of ingredients ahead of time rather than scaling in your head.
  Thus, the most likely completion to the text would provide further suggestions for how to determine the appropriate amount of ingredients when doubling a recipe.
  Option A provides a suggestion for copying the original recipe and writing out the ingredients.
  Option B is unrelated to the topic.
  Option C mentions a target circle but doesn't provide any instruction for doubling the recipe.
  Option D provides a sub-step for writing out the quantity of ingredients.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The question is asking for the most likely completion of the text "How to double a recipe".
  The current step advises to write each of the ingredients on a piece of paper.
  The next step gives advice for scaling a recipe correctly - write the amounts you need ahead of time.
  Option A is the most likely completion as it gives further guidance on copying the recipe and organizing the ingredients.
  Options B, C, and D are not related to the topic and do not provide any relevant advice.
  Therefore, the answer is A: If you have a copier, you may want to copy the original recipe and write in the margins, so that you have the instructions next to the ingredients. Write down all of the vegetables, flour, and meat products in 1 column. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
The first step instructs to write each of the ingredients on a piece of paper.
The next step advises to write out the amounts you need ahead of time.
The most logical next step would be to explain how to adjust the amounts for the larger recipe.
Option A and B seem to be irrelevant and not related to the question.
Option C does not provide any information on how to scale up the recipe.
Option D seems incorrect and confusing, especially with the reference to numbers.
The answer is A: [substeps] If you have a copier, you may want to copy the original recipe and write in the margins, so that you have the instructions next to the ingredients. [title] Write down all of the vegetables, flour and meat products in 1 column.

The text describes a woman who is dressed in an orange and red dress and is still holding the white paper while talking. 
There is nothing in the text that indicates any of the other answer choices may make sense.
Answer choice A is possible because it mentions the woman speaking again, but there is nothing else in the question stem to confirm that flashing words would appear on a screen.
Answer choice B is possible but at the same time vague, as it mentions the words flashing after the woman is talking and continuing to the end, but it doesn't specifically mention what the words say or where they are coming from.

Response 3:
Thought: 
  The sentence mentions that the woman from before appears again and is still holding the white paper.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to smell good [title] Bathe regularly. [step] On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.
Choices:
  A: This will be especially important if you live in a humid climate. Take a shower once a day and, if you cannot wait until the day of day 24 (when the weather is cool enough), twice a day.
  B: Showering too often is your body's way of telling your body that it needs to take out endorphins, or oxygenates, to make you smell great. [substeps] Spend time washing your hair twice a day and washing it once every other day with shampoo.
  C: Doing so helps revitalize your body; contrary to popular belief, especially the most powerful perfumes, other (and sometimes worst) smells can damage the skin, so you should also use warm water to keep your body and hair moisturized. [substeps] To use warm water, consider using a bar of soap, which is available at most department stores.
  D: [substeps] Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.

  C: continues to play the piano running out to the end and stopping for a while to talk to the audience.
  D: begins to play a tune while a close up of the piano is shown.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  According to the text, the focus is on a singer standing on a piano and talking into the mic while a drummer plays in the background.
  The most likely course of action for the drummer would be to continue playing in the background.
  Options A and C are unlikely because they mention the piano, which is not the focus of the text.
  Option D doesn't make sense because it suggests the drummer is playing the piano. 
  Option B involves the singer continuing to perform while the drummer plays in the background, making it the most likely option.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: continues singing to the audience followed by jumping off the piano and dancing around the stage.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The text describes a singer on a piano while a drummer plays in the background.
  It does not mention the drummer stopping or doing anything particular to transition the focus from him/her to the singer.
  It also mentions the singer talking into a microphone implying a break from singing.
  Choice A involves the singer continuing to play the piano, which is not mentioned in the text, so it is unlikely.
  Choice C also involves the singer continuing to play the piano, which is not mentioned in the text, so it is also unlikely.
  Choice D describes the drummer beginning to play a tune, but the text does not mention anything about the drummer transitioning to playing another instrument.
  This leaves choice B as the most likely completion to the text where the singer continues singing and performs a dance after jumping off the piano. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The prompt states that a singer is standing on a piano on a large stage while a drummer plays.
  It is unlikely that the singer will continue playing the piano since they are already standing on it.
  Option B is a possibility, but there is no mention of the singer starting to sing in the prompt.
  Option C does not make sense since the prompt only mentions the singer and the drummer, and there is no mention of the singer playing the piano.
  Option D does not make sense since the prompt is talking about the singer and drummer and not the piano.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the singer continues singing to the audience followed by jumping off the piano and dancing around the stage.
  The answer is B: continues singing to the audience followed by jumping off the piano and dancing around the stage.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The text describes a singer standing on a piano while a drummer plays in the background.
  Since the text doesn't mention the drummer, we can assume the question is asking about the singer's next move.
  Option A talks about the singer returning to the piano, which is not mentioned in the text. Eliminate it.
  Option D is about a close-up of the piano, which is not relevant because the focus is on the singer and drummer. Eliminate it.
  Option C mentions playing the piano but the singer is already standing on a piano. Eliminate it.
  Option B is the most logical because it describes the singer continuing to perform after talking into the mic, which is what the text mentions.

  Option A describes the singer continuing to play the piano, but it was not mentioned that the singer was playing the piano.
  Option B describes the singer jumping off the piano and dancing around on the stage, which is possible, but there is no indication that this is what the singer will do.

Thought:
  The passage mentions a singer and a drummer.
  The singer is standing on a piano talking into the mic.

Thought: 
  The text describes a male athlete who jumps high into the air and vaults backwards over a high beam.
  Therefore, it is likely that the next phrase would describe more information or details about the high jump.
  Option A, long distances, is not relevant to high jump.
  Option B is a possible completion, as slow motion replays are often shown in sports broadcasts.
  Option C mentions flips and twists, which are not necessarily a part of high jump.
  Option D suggests that the high jump is repeated multiple times, but this is unlikely as high jump is not a repeated event, and athletes typically only get a few attempts.

Response 1:
Thought:
The text is describing a male athlete jumping over a high beam.
No information suggests that the athlete went a long distance or repeated the jump several times.

Topic: Clean and jerk
Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
A man is trying to lift weights in a gym. he
Choices:
  A: is sitting down in front of a bar.
  B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
  C: lifts a barbell up to his neck.
  D: lifts the barbell up to his chest.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The term "clean and jerk" refers to a weightlifting movement that consists of two parts: the clean and the jerk.
  During the clean, the lifter lifts the barbell up to their shoulders.
  During the jerk, the lifter lifts the barbell up over their head.
  Since the man is trying to "lift weights," and "clean and jerk" involves lifting a barbell, the most likely completion to the text is that he "lifts the two weights up on his shoulders."
  Therefore, the answer is B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
The Clean and Jerk is a common weightlifting exercise.
In this exercise, the weightlifter first lifts the barbell up to their shoulders in a movement called the "clean."
They then lift the barbell up above their head in a movement called the "jerk."
Option A is incorrect because the text mentions that the man is trying to lift weights, not sitting down.
Option C is also incorrect because it describes only the clean part of the motion.
Option D is incorrect because it describes only the clean part of the motion and not the jerk.
Option B is the only correct answer because it describes both parts of the motion: lifting the weights up onto the shoulders and then lifting them up above the head.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The clean and jerk is an Olympic weightlifting exercise.
  It involves lifting a barbell from the ground to the shoulders (the 'clean') and then lifting the barbell above the head (the 'jerk').
  The question describes a man trying to lift weights in a gym.
  Of the given choices, only B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders is a correct description of the 'clean' portion of the clean and jerk lift.
  Therefore, B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders is the most likely completion to the text.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The clean and jerk is an Olympic weightlifting exercise.
  The exercise involves two phases: the clean phase and the jerk phase.
  In the clean phase, a person lifts a barbell up to their shoulders.
  In the jerk phase, a person lifts the barbell overhead.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the given text is "lifts the two weights up on his shoulders."
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Clean and Jerk is a weightlifting exercise where the athlete lifts a barbell with weights in two movements.
  The first movement is called the Clean, where the athlete lifts the barbell up to his shoulders.
  The second movement is called the Jerk, where the athlete lifts the barbell above his head.
  Choice A does not seem like a typical position for a Clean and Jerk exercise.
  Choice C is incorrect because the bar is not supposed to stop at the neck.
  Choice D is incorrect because the bar is not supposed to stop at the chest.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The clean and jerk is a weightlifting movement.
  It involves lifting a barbell to the shoulders and then pushing it overhead.
  Therefore, it is most likely that the man would lift the two weights up on his shoulders.
  Thus, the answer is B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The Clean and Jerk is a weightlifting exercise with two movements.
  The first movement, Clean, involves lifting the barbell or weights from the ground to the shoulders.
  The second movement, Jerk, involves lifting the barbell or weights from the shoulders to overhead.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is that the man lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
  The answer is B: lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
This text describes a man in a gym lifting weights, but the specific lift is not named. The clean and jerk are a two-part weightlifting movement, so "lifts" on its own is probably not enough to describe this particular exercise. Of the choices provided, only one mentions two weights, and only one mentions placing the weights on his shoulders, which is consistent with the clean and jerk.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
The Clean and Jerk is a weightlifting movement that involves two distinct phases:
  1) The Clean, where the barbell is lifted up to the shoulders
  2) The Jerk, where the lifter raises the barbell overhead.
  Given that the man is lifting weights, it is likely he is attempting to do the Clean and Jerk movement.
  The text implies that the man is starting a lift, rather than finishing. Therefore, he will lift the barbell up to his shoulders.
  The only choice that mentions the man lifting weights up to his shoulders is B, lifts the two weights up on his shoulders.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Clean and jerk is a weightlifting movement that involves lifting a barbell.
  The goal of the clean and jerk is to lift the barbell from the ground to shoulders and then overhead in two movements.
  The completion of the text should describe a movement that is part of a clean and jerk.
  Option C says "lifts a barbell up to his neck" which is part of a clean and jerk.

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to apply eyeliner to small round eyes [title] Apply a light-colored eyeliner to your waterline. [step] Use a white or nude colored eyeliner for the best results. Light colors will open and brighten your eyes so they look bigger.
Choices:
  A: You will need to apply the eyeliner in this color to begin with. Then, move on to your waterline and then your eyelid.
  B: Focus on your waterline when working with eyeliner. [substeps] For more precise eye work, get a small eye brush (such as a toothpick, eyebrow brush, or electric wand), and water that goes with eyeliner on smaller, streaky areas.
  C: [substeps] Apply a softer line of eyeliner on your waterline for a more natural look. Avoid applying eyeliner all the way across your waterline if you have close-set eyes, as this will make them appear closer together.
  D: [substeps] Only use white eyeliner for brown eyes. Otherwise, the eyeliner won't pop as much and will sink into your eyebrows and make your eyes look round.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The title of the text contains "small round eyes".
  The first step suggests using a white or nude eyeliner on the waterline.
  Based on the step, the completion should provide more information about working on the waterline.

Action: Answer("C")

Question: What is the most likely completion to the following text?
[header] How to take care of pearls [title] When you put them on, wear them after you're done with everything. [step] When you're taking everything off, take them off first. As an organic gem composed of calcium carbonate, pearls are more vulnerable to the chemicals found in cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.
Choices:
  A: If you have 1 large pearl, now would be the time to invest in 10 more, within the first 20 years. Just like any other stone, pearls are sometimes exposed to general pollutants, which mean they're more susceptible to infection and, less importantly, to degradation.
  B: Dress, style your hair, apply your make-up, and spray on your perfume before you put on any pearl jewelry. [title] Limit your use of pearl rings and bracelets.
  C: Stock a small jar and use old pearls as you find them, because they can keep from breaking. A spray bottle should be sufficient, but if you'd prefer to use a porcelain one, stock your applicator brush in a medium-sized jar.
  D: Generally, try wearing your pearls after you've finished bathing. [substeps] Those with olive oil removed earlier, and those without more exposure to the chemicals, often achieve a gloss that naturally helps conceal silver.

  Therefore, the answer is B: Be thoughtful and allow your partner to decide the next level of urgency (the best time for you and for your relationship). 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  The text is providing advice on how to accept a marriage proposal.
  The first step advises that the person should not ruin the surprise and to give their partner the chance to carry out a plan.
  The remaining options either contradict the first step provided or don't fit the context of the text.
  The most likely completion to the text is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The title of the article is "Don't ruin the surprise".
  The step provided is "If you believe that your partner plans to propose to you, give him or her the chance to carry out a plan. Don't try to rush the process along."
  The most likely completion is an additional step that continues to support the idea of not ruining the surprise.
  Option A talks about challenging the partner to compromise or change their mind which seems to be a deviation from the main idea.
  Option B talks about allowing the partner to set the urgency level but doesn't entirely support the idea that the proposal should be a surprise.
  Option D doesn't support the idea of not ruining the surprise as well.
  Option C talks about not giving any indication that you expect it, which supports the idea of not ruining the surprise.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Don't give any indication that you expect it.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The text advises the reader not to ruin the surprise and not to rush the proposal process.
  The most likely completion is advice to clearly communicate one's expectations for the proposal and to be patient.
  Option A is not in line with the advice given in the text.
  Option B may be tempting, but it is not the most likely completion based on the text.
  Option D is not relevant to the text.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  The woman in the video is rubbing honey on her face.
  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text.
  None of the choices suggest that the woman is washing her face.
  Only choice B suggests that the woman could put the jar to her face, but it doesn't indicate that she is using it to wash her face.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that the woman continues speaking while the honey is on her face.
  The answer is A: dries off the mask and continues speaking while smiling to the camera.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The woman is seen holding up a jar of honey.
  She continues speaking and leads into her rubbing honey on her face.
  The question is asking about what the woman does after rubbing honey on her face.
  None of the answer choices seem to make sense. 
  Option B sounds like it could be the continuation of the previous sentences but it still doesn't make sense.
  Therefore, 'None of the above" seems to be the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
The woman speaks to the camera and talks about honey, and then rubs honey on her face. 
The question asks for what she does after rubbing honey on her face. 
Only option A, dries off the mask and continues speaking while smiling to the camera, seems to provide a logical continuation of what she would do after applying honey to her face.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The woman is seen holding up a jar of honey, and then leads into rubbing it on her face.
  The sentence is incomplete and requires a continuation of what the woman does next.
  Option A does not make sense as the woman has not put on a mask.
  Option B seems unlikely as it does not make sense to "brace her fingers on the jar."
  Option C could be a possibility as the woman may pour the honey onto her fingers and then dry her face off.
  Option D seems unlikely as the woman has not cleaned her face yet.
  Therefore, the most fitting answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The text describes a woman speaking to the camera and holding up a jar of honey.
  The woman leads into rubbing honey on her face.
  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text.
  The most logical and likely completion would be a description of what the woman does after she rubs honey on her face.
  Option A describes the woman drying off the mask and continuing to speak while smiling to the camera, which does not make sense since there was no mention of a mask before.
  Option B describes the woman bracing her fingers on the jar and eventually putting it to her face, which could be possible but is not the most likely completion.
  Option C describes the woman pouring the honey onto her fingers and then drying her face off, which is unlikely since drying off her face would remove the honey that she just put on.
  Option D describes the woman wiping down her face and leading back to her, which does not make sense since she had just put honey on her face.
  Therefore, the most likely completion is that she leaves the honey on her face.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The prompt describes a woman who holds up a jar of honey, then applies honey on her face.
  The question is asking what she does after rubbing honey on her face.
  Choices A and D seem unlikely since they mention "drying off" the face and "wiping down" the face, which are not mentioned in the prompt.
  Choice B, "braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face," does not make sense contextually.
  Therefore, the most likely answer is C, "then pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off." This is a logical next step after rubbing honey on one's face.  
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The text describes a woman holding up a jar of honey and then rubbing it on her face.
  The question is asking for the most likely completion of the sentence starting with "she."

Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The woman is seen leading into holding up a jar of honey.
  She is talking to the camera and leads into her rubbing honey on her face.
  The question is asking what she does after she rubs honey on her face.
  Option A seems unlikely because she wouldn't have to dry off the honey mask.
  Option B is also unlikely because she had already rubbed honey on her face.
  Option D is not accurate as it doesn't explain what she does after rubbing honey on her face.
  Option C is the most likely answer, as she pours the honey onto her fingers and then dries her face off.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The woman is holding up a jar of honey and leads into rubbing it on her face.
  The action of rubbing honey on the face implies that she is washing her face with honey or using a honey mask.
  The sentence should reflect the act of washing the face with honey or applying it as a mask.
  Option A, D, and C are not describing an action of washing face with honey.
  Option B seems like it might be a possibility, but it is not clear enough.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text would be the woman holding up the jar of honey and eventually puts some honey on her face as a mask.
  The answer is option B: Braces her fingers on the jar and eventually puts it to her face. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The woman is using honey on her face.
  After rubbing honey on her face, she would most likely complete the process by either rinsing or wiping the honey off her face.

  Choice A suggests that she dries the mask and continues speaking, but it is unclear what she dried.
  Choice D suggests that she wipes down her face, but it is unclear what she wipes it with.

Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
 The text mentions that people ride a boat and interact with each other. It also describes that a lady hula hoops and a male leaps from the rocks into the water. 
 The text does not mention any activity taking place on the beach, so we can rule out choice A.
 The text mentions that people are riding a boat and interacting so they are not on the shore, thus we can eliminate option B.
 The text mentions that people are riding a boat, but it does not say that they are flipping on the water. Therefore, we can exclude option C. 
 The text mentions that a male leaps from the rocks into the water, but it does not describe how people swim. Therefore, we can eliminate option D. 
 Therefore, the most likely completion is that people ride a boat, interact with each other, a lady hula hoops, and a male leaps from the rocks into the water while they are on the boat.

Choices:
  A: You may have to help someone who is trying to get sick; however, all help that begins is giving young children to care for themselves. [title] Understand that some health concerns are very taxing for any individual and can be diagnosed in the first few years of life.
  B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you.
  C: The cps requires the cps to be the main responsibility of all employers and to provide constant monitoring of all employees. These are who the office worker must be in order to direct transferrable shifts.
  D: This work program mainly functions when the child has a medical issue or if the child is feeling depressed or unwell. Any child with a medical problem may be contacted and assessed for child protective services, and the program tracks down potential problems with the specific child in question.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  The text describes the nature of the job and mentions that it can involve overtime, irregular hours, and dangerous situations.
  The next step is to select the completion that best relates to the job responsibilities of a child protective services worker.
  Choice A talks about helping someone who is trying to get sick, which does not seem related to child protective services.
  Choice C talks about constant monitoring of employees and transferrable shifts, which is not directly related to the job of a child protective services worker.
  Choice D talks about child protective services functioning mainly for medical issues and tracking down potential problems, but this does not cover all the aspects of the job.
  Choice B talked about investigating allegations of neglect, removing children from homes, needing police escort for some situations, and encountering hostile people. This seems to be the most likely completion as it covers many of the responsibilities of a child protective services worker.
  Therefore, the answer is B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

The answer is a continuation of the information provided in the text.
Choice A talks about giving young children to care for themselves which is not in line with the text.
Choice C is talking about something completely different from the text.
Choice D talks about a work program that mainly functions when the child has a medical issue or if the child is feeling depressed or unwell which is not related to CPS.
Choice B is the correct answer which talks about the most likely actions to be taken as a CPS worker, such as the investigation of allegations of neglect and removing children from risky situations. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: The text explains that working for child protective services can involve overtime, irregular hours, and entering dangerous situations. The most likely completion to the text would be a description of the tasks that one might have to perform while working for child protective services. An option that describes the need to investigate allegations of neglect, removing children from homes, and encountering hostility would match the description. Thus, the answer is B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

  The question is asking for the most likely completion to the text about how to work for child protective services.
  The text talks about how CPS is not a routine job and can involve overtime and dangerous situations.
  Based on that information, the completion that makes the most sense is the one that explains some of the potential difficult tasks that workers may have to do.
  Choice A talks about helping sick individuals, but that is not directly related to the topic of the text.
  Choice C talks about monitoring employees and shifts, but that is not related to the topic of the text either.
  Choice D talks about child medical issues, but that is not related to the topic of the text and is not a common task for CPS workers.
  Choice B describes the difficult task of investigating allegations of neglect and hostile encounters, which is a more likely completion to the text based on the information provided.
  Therefore, the answer is B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The text describes what child protective services is and mentions that it is a job that may involve overtime, irregular hours, and dangerous situations.
  Answer choice A talks about helping someone get sick, caring for young children, and health concerns, which are not related to the text's topic.
  Answer choice B talks about investigating allegations of neglect and removing children from their homes, which is related to child protective services and mentions the possible need for a police escort and hostile individuals, which is consistent with the text's description of dangerous situations.
  Answer choice C talks about employers and employees with transferrable shifts, which is not related to the text's topic.
  Answer choice D talks about child protective services mainly functioning when children have medical issues or feel depressed or unwell, which is not consistent with the text's description of child protective services involving dangerous situations and irregular hours.
  Therefore, the most likely completion to the text is B: You could be required to investigate allegations of neglect and remove children from the homes of their parents. You may need a police escort for some situations, and you will likely encounter people who are hostile toward you.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  B: For example, if you have a fleece style rug, use that as your display. Make sure the pattern matches your bedspread.
  C: [substeps] If you can, choose a style you will generally love. Instead of traditional wall rugs, choose patterned rugs or texture rugs to accent your room.

  The sentence "Choose a high quality cocoa powder and be sure that you're not using bars of chocolate or hot cocoa mix. These contain additional ingredients that could make your lip balm spoil or go bad," is informative, but not part of the step-by-step instructions.

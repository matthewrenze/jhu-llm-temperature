Choices:
  A: 5%
  B: 15%
  C: 25%
  D: 35%
  E: 45%
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 100 employees in the company.
  75% of the employees take a winter vacation, which means 75 employees take a winter vacation.
  40% of the employees take a winter and a summer vacation, which means 40 employees take both vacations.
  20% of the employees take neither a winter nor a summer vacation, which means 20 employees take neither vacation.
  We can use this information to find the number of employees who take a summer vacation but not a winter vacation.
  Let's call this number Q.
  Q = (number of employees who take a summer vacation) - (number of employees who take both vacations)
  Q = (100% - 20%) - 40%

Topic: Math
Question: Assistants are needed to prepare for preparation. Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr. The kitchen is available for 3 hours and 20 large cakes & 700 small cakes are needed. How many helpers are required?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 10
  C: 12
  D: 15
  E: 19
Response 0:
Thought:
- Each helper can make either 2 large cakes or 35 small cakes/hr.
- The kitchen is available for 3 hours, so the total number of hours available is 3 * 1 = 3 hours.
- We need to make 20 large cakes and 700 small cakes.
- Let's first calculate how many large cakes can be made in 3 hours by one helper: 2 large cakes/hour * 3 hours = 6 large cakes.
- To make 20 large cakes, we need 20 large cakes / 6 large cakes per helper = 3.33 helpers. We can't have a fraction of a helper, so we need 4 helpers to make 20 large cakes.
- Now let's calculate how many small cakes can be made in 3 hours by one helper: 35 small cakes/hour * 3 hours = 105 small cakes.
- To make 700 small cakes, we need 700 small cakes / 105 small cakes per helper = 6.67 helpers. We can't have a fraction of a helper, so we need 7 helpers to make 700 small cakes.
- The total number of helpers needed is 4 + 7 = 11.
- Therefore, the answer is B: 10.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 6 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: An express electric train takes exact three seconds to enter tunnel which is 1 mile long.
If train is traveling at 120 mile an hour, how long will it take to pass completely through the tunnel ?
Choices:
  A: 43 seconds
  B: 39 seconds
  C: 20 seconds
  D: 33 seconds
  E: 55 seconds
Response 0:
Thought:
  The train takes 3 seconds to enter the tunnel.
  The tunnel is 1 mile long.
  The train is traveling at 120 miles per hour.
  We need to find the time it takes for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.
  We can use the formula: time = distance / speed.
  The distance is 1 mile + 1 mile = 2 miles (since the train has to travel the length of the tunnel twice).
  We need to convert the speed to miles per second, so we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour).
  speed = 120 miles/hour / 3600 seconds/hour = 1/30 miles/second.
  time = distance / speed = 2 miles / (1/30 miles/second) = 60 seconds.
  Therefore, it will take 60 seconds for the train to pass completely through the tunnel.

Topic: Math
Question: An electric pole, 14 metres high, casts a shadow of 10 metres. Find the height of a tree that casts a shadow of 15 metres under similar conditions.
Choices:
  A: 21
  B: 22
  C: 20
  D: 23
  E: 24
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's use the concept of similar triangles to solve this problem.
  The ratio of the height of the pole to the length of its shadow is 14/10.
  Let x be the height of the tree.
  The ratio of the height of the tree to the length of its shadow is x/15.
  Since the triangles are similar, the ratios of corresponding sides are equal.
  Therefore, we can set up the proportion: 14/10 = x/15 and solve for x.
  Cross-multiplying, we get 10x = 14 * 15.
  Solving for x, we get x = 21.
  Therefore, the height of the tree is 21 meters.

  A: D/(M-3)
  B: MD/3
  C: M/(D-3)
  D: 3D/(M2-3M)
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  Initially, M men agreed to purchase a gift for Rs. D.
  Therefore, each man would have to contribute D/M rupees.
  If 3 men drop out, then the total number of men who will contribute towards the purchase of the gift will be (M-3).

Question: My wall contains 8 red colour ties, 13 violet colour ties,10 blue colour ties, 5 pink colour ties, 4 green colour ties. If electricity is gone and I want at least two ties of same colour then how many ties I should take out from my rack?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  To ensure that we have at least two ties of the same color, we need to take out ties of different colors until we have two of the same color.
  The worst-case scenario is that we take out one tie of each color before we get two of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out 5 different ties before we can be sure we have at least two of the same color.
  We can check that this is true by considering the case where we take out fewer than 5 ties.
  If we take out 4 or fewer ties, we could end up with at most one tie of each color, which is not enough to have at least two of the same color.
  Therefore, we need to take out at least 5 ties to ensure we have at least two of the same color.

Question: Alice wants to put up fencing around three sides of her rectangular yard and leave one side of 10 meters unfenced. If the yard has an area of 240 square meters, how many meters of fencing does she need?
Choices:
  A: 58
  B: 62
  C: 66
  D: 70
  E: 74
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the length of the yard is L and the width is W.
  The area of the yard is given as L * W = 240.
  We know that one side of the yard is 10 meters long and unfenced.
  Therefore, the perimeter of the yard is 2L + W + 10.
  We need to find the value of 2L + W + 10.
  We can solve for W in terms of L from the area equation: W = 240 / L.
  Substituting this value of W in the perimeter equation, we get: 2L + (240 / L) + 10.
  To minimize the perimeter, we need to find the value of L that minimizes the above expression.
  We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to L and setting it to zero.
  Solving this equation gives us L = 12.
  Substituting this value of L in the perimeter equation, we get: 2(12) + (240 / 12) + 10 = 46.
  Therefore, Alice needs 46 meters of fencing.

  Substituting this value of W in the perimeter equation, we get: 2L + (240 / L) + 10.
  To minimize the perimeter, we need to find the value of L that minimizes the above expression.
  We can do this by taking the derivative of the expression with respect to L and setting it to zero.
  Solving this equation gives us L = 12.
  Substituting this value of L in the perimeter equation, we get: 2(12) + (240 / 12) + 10 = 46.
  Therefore, Alice needs 46 meters of fencing.

Question: Anna is able to buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price of each article decreased by 15%. What is the new selling price of each article?
Choices:
  A: $8
  B: $10
  C: $13.6
  D: $22.9
  E: $40
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300, then the original price of each article was $300/(number of articles) before the price decrease.
  Let's assume that the original price of each article was $x.
  After the price decrease of 15%, the new price of each article is (100% - 15%) * x = 85% * x.
  We know that Anna can buy 5 more articles for $300 after the price decrease.
  So, (number of articles) = (original number of articles) + 5.
  We can set up an equation using the information above and solve for x.
  300 = (original number of articles) * 85% * x + 5 * 85% * x
  300 = (original number of articles + 5) * 85% * x
  x = 300 / [(original number of articles + 5) * 85%]
  We don't know the original number of articles, but we can still solve for the new price of each article using the equation above.

Question: A rope 20 meters long is cut into two pieces. If the length of one piece of rope is 3 meters shorter than the length of the other, what is the length, in meters, of the longer piece of rope?
Choices:
  A: 7.5
  B: 8.9
  C: 9.9
  D: 11.5
  E: 11.7
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let x be the length of the longer piece of rope.

Topic: Math
Question: A number of friends decided to go on a picnic and planned to spend Rs. 96 on eatables. Four of them, however, did not turn up. As a consequence, the remaining ones had to contribute Rs. 4 extra, each. The number of those who attended the picnic was
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 12
  C: 16
  D: 24
  E: 25
Response 0:
Thought:
Let's assume that the total number of friends who planned to go on a picnic is "x".
The total amount they planned to spend is Rs. 96.
If 4 of them did not turn up, then the remaining number of friends is "x-4".
Each of the remaining friends had to contribute Rs. 4 extra.
So, the total amount collected after the 4 friends did not turn up is:
96 + (x-4)*4
We know that the total amount collected after the 4 friends did not turn up is equal to the amount that the remaining friends had to contribute, which is:
x * (96/x + 4)
Equating both the expressions, we get:
96 + (x-4)*4 = x * (96/x + 4)
Solving this equation, we get x = 12.
Therefore, the number of those who attended the picnic was 12.
The answer is B: 12.

  We need to find how much time it will take for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.
  We can use the formula: distance = rate x time.
  Let's assume that t is the time it takes for the distance between the two cars to be 15 miles.
  Therefore, 3t = 15.
  Solving for t, we get t = 5.
  Therefore, it will take 5 hours for the cars to be 15 miles away from each other.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Suppose for any real number x, [x] denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. Let L(x,y) = [x] + [y] + [x + y] and R(x,y) = [2x] + [2y]. Then it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which
Choices:
  A: L(x,y) = R(x,y)
  B: L(x,y) ≠ R(x,y)
  C: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  D: L(x,y) < R(x,y)
  E: None
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's try to simplify the expressions L(x,y) and R(x,y).
  For L(x,y), [x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x, [y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to y, and [x+y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to x+y.
  For R(x,y), [2x] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2x, and [2y] is the greatest integer less than or equal to 2y.
  Since [x+y] ≤ x+y and [2x] ≤ 2x and [2y] ≤ 2y, we have
  L(x,y) ≤ [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ x + y + [x+y] and R(x,y) ≤ [2x] + [2y] ≤ 2x + 2y.
  Therefore, if L(x,y) = R(x,y), then we must have
  [x] + [y] + [x+y] = [2x] + [2y].
  Since [x] ≤ x and [y] ≤ y, we have [x] + [y] ≤ x + y.
  Also, [x+y] ≤ x+y, so [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ 2(x+y).
  Therefore, we have
  2(x+y) = [x] + [y] + [x+y] ≤ 2(x+y),
  which implies that [x] + [y] + [x+y] = 2(x+y).
  Let's consider the case where x and y are positive integers.
  Then [x] = x and [y] = y, so we have
  x + y + [x+y] = 2(x+y),
  which implies that [x+y] = x+y.
  But this is impossible, since [x+y] is an integer and x+y is not an integer.
  Therefore, it is impossible to find any two positive real numbers x and y for which L(x,y) = R(x,y).

Question: While selling a watch, a shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%. If he gives a discount of 7%, he earns Rs. 15 less as profit. The marked price of the watch is:
Choices:
  A: Rs. 697.50
  B: Rs. 712.50
  C: Rs. 787.50
  D: Rs. 750
  E: Rs. 780
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let the marked price of the watch be M.
  The shopkeeper gives a discount of 5%, so the selling price is 0.95M.
  If the shopkeeper gives a discount of 7%, the selling price is 0.93M.
  The difference in profit is Rs. 15.
  We can set up an equation to solve for M:
    M - 0.95M = M - 0.93M + 15
    0.02M = 15
    M = 750
  Therefore, the marked price of the watch is Rs. 750.

Question: I have a money pouch containing Rs. 700. There are equal number of 25 paise coins, 50 paise coins and one rupee coins.
How many of each are there?
Choices:
  A: 453
  B: 651
  C: 400
  D: 487
  E: 286
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that there are 'x' number of each 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins.
  The total value of the coins is Rs. 700.
  The value of 'x' number of 25 paise coins is 0.25 * 0.25 * x = 0.0625x
  The value of 'x' number of 50 paise coins is 0.50 * 0.25 * x = 0.125x
  The value of 'x' number of 1 rupee coins is 1 * x = 1x
  The total value of the coins is 0.0625x + 0.125x + 1x = 1.1875x
  We need to find the value of 'x' that makes 1.1875x = 700
  Solving for 'x', we get x = 487.8
  Since we cannot have a fraction of a coin, we can round 'x' to the nearest whole number, which is 488.
  Therefore, there are 488 of each 25 paise, 50 paise, and 1 rupee coins.

Topic: Math
Question: The height of a room to its semi-perimeter is 2:5. It costs Rs.260 to paper the walls of the room with paper 50cm wide at Rs.2 per meter allowing an area of 15 sq.m for doors and windows. The height of the room is:
Choices:
  A: 2.6m
  B: 3.9m
  C: 4m
  D: 4.2m
  E: 4.4m
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  So, (Rs.4)/(0.5m) = Rs.8 is the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 1m.
  Therefore, (Rs.8)/(260/(9x^2 - 15)) = (9x^2 - 15)/32 is the area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15)/32 = 9x^2 - 15 = area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15) = (9x^2)(2x)/(5x) = 18x^3/5.
  Therefore, 18x^3/5 = 9x^2 - 15.
  18x^3 - 45x^2 - 75 = 0.
  2x^3 - 5x^2 - 5 = 0.
  By trial and error, we can find that x = 2.
  Therefore, the height of the room is 2x = 4m.
  The answer is C: 4m.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  So, (Rs.4)/(0.5m) = Rs.8 is the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 1m.
  Therefore, (Rs.8)/(260/(9x^2 - 15)) = (9x^2 - 15)/32 is the area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15)/32 = 9x^2 - 15 = area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15) = (9x^2)(2x)/(5x) = 18x^3/5.
  Therefore, 18x^3/5 = 9x^2 - 15.
  18x^3 - 45x^2 - 75 = 0.
  2x^3 - 5x^2 - 5 = 0.

  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  So, (Rs.4)/(0.5m) = Rs.8 is the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 1m.

  The answer is C: 4m.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Let's assume the height of the room is 2x and the semi-perimeter is 5x.
  Then, the length of the room is 5x/2 - 2x = 9x/2.
  The area of the four walls is (2x)(9x/2) = 9x^2.
  The area of the doors and windows is 15 sq.m.
  The area of the four walls after deducting the area of doors and windows is 9x^2 - 15.
  The cost of papering the walls is Rs.260.
  The cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall is Rs.260/(9x^2 - 15).
  The width of the paper is 50cm = 0.5m and the cost of 1m of paper is Rs.2.
  Therefore, the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 50cm is Rs.4.
  So, (Rs.4)/(0.5m) = Rs.8 is the cost of papering 1 sq.m of the wall with paper of width 1m.
  Therefore, (Rs.8)/(260/(9x^2 - 15)) = (9x^2 - 15)/32 is the area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15)/32 = 9x^2 - 15 = area of the wall that can be papered with Rs.260.
  (9x^2 - 15) = (9x^2)(2x)/(5x) = 18x^3/5.
  Therefore, 18x^3/5 = 9x^2 - 15.
  18x^3 - 45x^2 - 75 = 0.
  2x^3 - 5x^2 - 5 = 0.

Question: What should come in place of the question mark(?) in each of the following questions ?
a2 - b2/(a + b)2 (?)=(a - b)2
Choices:
  A: (a + b)(a - b)
  B: (a - b)2
  C: (a + b)2
  D: a3 + b3
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can simplify the left-hand side of the equation using the identity a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b).
  a^2 - b^2 = (a + b)(a - b)
  Therefore, a^2 - b^2 / (a + b)^2 = (a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)^2
  Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
  (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2
  (a - b)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab
  (a - b)^2 = a^2 - b^2 - 2ab + 2b^2
  (a - b)^2 = (a^2 - b^2) + 2b^2 - 2ab
  (a - b)^2 = (a + b)(a - b) + 2b(a - b)
  (a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a + b + 2b)
  (a - b)^2 = (a - b)(a + 3b)
  Therefore, (a + b)(a - b) / (a + b)^2 = (a - b)(a + 3b) / (a + b)^2
  Cancelling out (a - b) and (a + b) from the numerator and denominator, we get:
  (a - b) / (a + b) = (a + 3b) / (a + b)
  a - b = a + 3b
  -b = 3b
  b = 0
  This implies that the denominator of the original expression is (a + b)^2 = a^2, and the numerator is (a - b)^2 = a^2.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Everyone in the family earns money each month. If the total income of a family per month is $9000 and the median income is $3000, how many members are there in the family?
Choices:
  A: 2
  B: 3
  C: 4
  D: 5
  E: 6
Response 0:
Thought:
  The median income is the middle value of the incomes when they are arranged in order.
  If the median income is $3000, then there are incomes above and below that value.
  Let's assume there are n members in the family.
  If we arrange the incomes in order from lowest to highest, then the median income is the (n+1)/2-th income.
  If the median income is $3000, then the sum of the incomes below $3000 is also $3000.
  The sum of all the incomes is $9000.
  Therefore, the sum of the incomes above $3000 is $3000 as well.
  There are (n-1)/2 incomes above $3000 and (n-1)/2 incomes below $3000.
  The sum of the incomes above $3000 is (n-1)/2 * x, where x is the income of each member above $3000.
  The sum of the incomes below $3000 is (n-1)/2 * y, where y is the income of each member below $3000.
  We know that x + y = $3000, and x = y.
  Therefore, x = y = $1500.
  The sum of all the incomes is n * $1500 = $9000.
  Therefore, n = 6.

Choices:
  A: 2 months
  B: 4 months
  C: 23 months
  D: 24 months
  E: 84 months
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume C joined the business after x months.
  A invested for the entire year, B invested for (12-2)=10 months, and C invested for (12-x) months.
  The ratio of their investments is (A:B:C) = (40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x))
  The ratio of their profits is the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is P.
  Then, P/C's investment = Total profit/Total investment
  P/(120000*(12-x)) = 375000/(40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12-x))

  The ratio of their investments is (A:B:C) = (40000*12 : 60000*10 : 120000*(12-x))
  The ratio of their profits is the same as the ratio of their investments.
  Let's assume C's share of the profit is P.
  Then, P/C's investment = Total profit/Total investment
  P/(120000*(12-x)) = 375000/(40000*12 + 60000*10 + 120000*(12-x))
  Solving for x, we get x=4.
  Therefore, C joined the business after 4 months.

Choices:
  A: 40

  C: 82
  D: 92
  E: 102
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the k consecutive integers are x, x+1, x+2, ..., x+k-1.
  We know that the sum of these integers is 51.
  Therefore, we can write an equation as follows:
  x + (x+1) + (x+2) + ... + (x+k-1) = 51
  Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
  kx + (1+2+...+(k-1)) = 51
  kx + (k-1)k/2 = 51
  kx + (k^2-k)/2 = 51
  k(2x+k-1)/2 = 51
  Since the least integer is -50, we know that x = -50.
  Substituting x = -50, we get:
  k(-99+k)/2 = 51
  -99k + k^2 = 102
  Rearranging the terms, we get:
  k^2 - 99k + 102 = 0
  Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
  k = 3 or k = 96
  Since we are looking for a positive value of k, the answer is k = 96.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: A certain liquid passes through a drain at a rate of w/25 gallons every x seconds. At that rate, how many minutes will it take y gallons to pass through the drain?
Choices:
  A: y/(1200xy)
  B: 20xy/w
  C: 5xy/(12w)
  D: w/(3xy)
  E: 3y/(wx)
Response 0:
Thought:
  The rate at which the liquid passes through the drain is w/25 gallons every x seconds.
  We can find the rate in gallons per minute by multiplying the rate in gallons per second by 60.
  The rate in gallons per second is w/25 gallons every x seconds, which is (w/25)*(1/x) gallons per second.
  Multiplying by 60 gives us (w/25)*(1/x)*60 = 12w/x gallons per minute.
  To find how many minutes it will take y gallons to pass through the drain, we can use the formula:
  time = amount / rate
  Plugging in the values we have, we get:
  time = y / (12w/x) = yx / (12w)
  Therefore, the answer is A: y/(1200xy).

Question: A rectangular parking space is marked out by painting three of its sides. If the length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, and the sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, then what is the area of the parking space in square feet?
Choices:
  A: 46
  B: 81
  C: 126
  D: 252
  E: None
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the length of the painted sides is l and w, where l is the length and w is the width of the parking space.
  The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the parking space is l = 9 + w.
  The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so l + w + l = 37, which simplifies to 2l + w = 37.
  Substituting l = 9 + w into the equation 2l + w = 37, we get 2(9 + w) + w = 37, which simplifies to 2w = 19.
  Therefore, w = 9.5 feet and l = 18.5 feet.
  The area of the parking space is A = l * w = 18.5 * 9.5 = 175.75 square feet.

  The length of the unpainted side is 9 feet, so the length of the parking space is l = 9 + w.
  The sum of the lengths of the painted sides is 37 feet, so l + w + l = 37, which simplifies to 2l + w = 37.
  Substituting l = 9 + w into the equation 2l + w = 37, we get 2(9 + w) + w = 37, which simplifies to 2w = 19.
  Therefore, w = 9.5 feet and l = 18.5 feet.
  The area of the parking space is A = l * w = 18.5 * 9.5 = 175.75 square feet.
  The closest answer is C: 126.

Question: Hoses A and B spout water at different constant rates, and hose A can fill a certain pool in 8 hours. Hose A filled the pool alone for the first 2 hours and the two hoses, working together, then finished filling the pool in another 3 hours. How many hours would it have taken hose B, working alone, to fill the entire pool?
Choices:
  A: 8
  B: 15
  C: 12
  D: 6
  E: 3
Response 0:

Question: If one of the roots of the quadratic equation x^2 + mx + 22 = 0 is 1.5, then what is the value of m?
Choices:
  A: -23.5
  B: -17.5
  C: -10.5
  D: -16.2
  E: Cannot be determined
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that one of the roots of the quadratic equation is 1.5.
  Let's use the quadratic formula to solve for the other root: x = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 4(1)(22))) / 2(1)
  We know that one of the roots is 1.5, so we can substitute that in for x and solve for m.
  1.5 = (-m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)) / 2
  Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3
  Square both sides: m^2 - 88 = 9 - 6m + m^2
  Simplify: 6m = 97
  Solve for m: m = 97/6
  Therefore, the value of m is approximately 16.17, which is closest to D: -16.2.

  Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the denominator: 3 = -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88)
  Subtract 3 from both sides: -m ± sqrt(m^2 - 88) = -3
  Square both sides: m^2 - 88 = 9 - 6m + m^2
  Simplify: 6m = 97
  Solve for m: m = 97/6
  Therefore, the value of m is approximately 16.17, which is closest to D: -16.2.

Since the remainder is the same when 2272 and 875 are divided by N, the 3-digit number N must be a factor of 1397.
The factors of 1397 are 1 and 1397.
We can eliminate 1 because it is not a 3-digit number.
The sum of the digits of 1397 is 20, which is not one of the answer choices.
Therefore, the answer is none of the above.

Question: By himself, Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours. On a particular day, he happens to finish two-thirds of the work. The remaining portion of the work is done by Jill, whose rate of cleaning is just 5% of what Jack can do. How long does it take Jill to finish the remaining work?

Thought:
  Jack can clean a yacht in 12 hours, so his rate of cleaning is 1/12 of the yacht per hour.
  On a particular day, Jack finishes two-thirds of the work, so the remaining one-third of the work is left.
  Let's assume that the total work is 12 units (LCM of 3 and 12).
  Jack finishes 8 units of work (two-thirds of 12 units).
  The remaining 4 units of work will be done by Jill.
  Jill's rate of cleaning is 5% of what Jack can do, so her rate of cleaning is 1/240 of the yacht per hour (5% of 1/12).
  Let's use the formula: rate = work / time.
  Jack's rate is 1/12, and Jill's rate is 1/240.
  Let's assume that Jill takes t hours to finish the remaining work.
  Jack has already finished 8 units of work, so Jill has to finish 4 units of work.
  Using the formula: rate = work / time, we can write an equation:
  1/12 * (12/3) + 1/240 * t = 4/3
  Simplifying the equation, we get:
  1/4 + 1/240 * t = 1/3
  1/240 * t = 1/3 - 1/4
  1/240 * t = 1/12
  t = 12
  Therefore, it takes Jill 12 hours to finish the remaining work.

  A: 22 hrs
  B: 18 hrs
  C: 16 hrs
  D: 20 hrs
  E: 13 hrs
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 'x' hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is also 'x' hours.
  According to the problem, Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.
  Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Sam = time taken to go by train + time taken to return by car
  Total time taken = x + x = 2x
  According to the problem, Mr. Sam loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to go both ways by train = 17 + 17 - 4 = 30 hours
  The time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = Total time taken - Time taken to go both ways by train
  Time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = 2x - 30
  We need to find the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways.
  Therefore, we need to find the value of 2x - 30.

  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to go both ways by train = 17 + 17 - 4 = 30 hours
  The time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = Total time taken - Time taken to go both ways by train
  Time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = 2x - 30
  We need to find the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel by car in both ways.
  Therefore, we need to find the value of 2x - 30.
  Let's solve for x.
  x + x = 17
  2x = 17
  x = 8.5
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = 2x - 30 = 2(8.5) - 30 = 17 - 30 = -13
  The answer cannot be negative. Therefore, the answer is "None of the above".

  Let's assume that the time taken by Mr. Sam to travel to the city by train is 'x' hours.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to return by car is also 'x' hours.
  According to the problem, Mr. Sam takes 17 hours to go by train to the city and return by car.
  Therefore, the total time taken by Mr. Sam = time taken to go by train + time taken to return by car
  Total time taken = x + x = 2x
  According to the problem, Mr. Sam loses 4 hours if he goes both ways by train.
  Therefore, the time taken by Mr. Sam to go both ways by train = 17 + 17 - 4 = 30 hours
  The time taken by Mr. Sam to go by car both ways = Total time taken - Time taken to go both ways by train

Question: For bringing each copper coin from the bottom of a river, a coin-diver gets 20 cents, and for each brass coin she gets 25 cents. If after one dive, she got $3.40. What is the minimum number of copper coins that she brought?
Choices:
  A: 4
  B: 3
  C: 2
  D: 1
  E: 0
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume that the diver brought x copper coins and y brass coins.
  The amount of money she gets for each copper coin is 20 cents, and she brought x copper coins, so the total amount of money she gets for copper coins is 20x cents.
  The amount of money she gets for each brass coin is 25 cents, and she brought y brass coins, so the total amount of money she gets for brass coins is 25y cents.
  The total amount of money she got after one dive is $3.40, which is equal to 340 cents.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 20x + 25y = 340
  We need to find the minimum number of copper coins that she brought, which means we need to minimize the value of x.
  Let's try to solve for x in terms of y: 20x = 340 - 25y => x = (340 - 25y)/20
  Since x has to be a whole number, we need to find a value of y that makes (340 - 25y)/20 a whole number.
  The only value of y that satisfies this condition is y = 2.
  If y = 2, then x = (340 - 25*2)/20 = 3.
  Therefore, the minimum number of copper coins that she brought is 3.

Question: The sum of the digits of a three digit number is 17, and the sum of the squares of its digits is 109. If we subtract 495 from the number, we shall get a number consisting of the same digits written in the reverse order. Find the number.

  A: 368
  B: 377
  C: 288
  D: 997
  E: 112

Thought:
  Let the three digit number be represented by abc.
  Then, a + b + c = 17 and a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109.
  Also, 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495, which gives a - c = 5.
  We can use the first two equations to solve for b and c in terms of a.
  From a + b + c = 17, we get b + c = 17 - a.
  From a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109, we get b^2 + c^2 = 109 - a^2.
  We can substitute b + c = 17 - a into b^2 + c^2 = 109 - a^2 to get:
  (17 - a)^2 - 2bc = 109 - a^2
  Simplifying the above equation, we get bc = (a - 4)(a - 8)/2.
  Since a, b, and c are digits, we know that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
  We can use this fact to try different values of a until we find a solution that satisfies all the conditions.
  We can start with a = 9 and work our way down.
  If a = 9, then bc = 20, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 8, then bc = 12, which gives b = 3 and c = 4.
  If a = 7, then bc = 5, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 6, then bc = 2, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 5, then bc = 0, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 4, then bc = 4, which gives b = 2 and c = 2.
  Therefore, the three digit number is 422, and the answer is (422 + 495) = 917.

  Also, 100a + 10b + c - 495 = 100c + 10b + a.
  Simplifying the above equation, we get 99a - 99c = 495, which gives a - c = 5.
  We can use the first two equations to solve for b and c in terms of a.
  From a + b + c = 17, we get b + c = 17 - a.
  From a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 109, we get b^2 + c^2 = 109 - a^2.
  We can substitute b + c = 17 - a into b^2 + c^2 = 109 - a^2 to get:
  (17 - a)^2 - 2bc = 109 - a^2
  Simplifying the above equation, we get bc = (a - 4)(a - 8)/2.
  Since a, b, and c are digits, we know that 0 <= a, b, c <= 9.
  We can use this fact to try different values of a until we find a solution that satisfies all the conditions.
  We can start with a = 9 and work our way down.
  If a = 9, then bc = 20, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 8, then bc = 12, which gives b = 3 and c = 4.
  If a = 7, then bc = 5, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 6, then bc = 2, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 5, then bc = 0, which is not possible since b and c are digits.
  If a = 4, then bc = 4, which gives b = 2 and c = 2.
  Therefore, the three digit number is 422, and the answer is (422 + 495) = 917.
  The answer is D: 997.

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: All 250 files on Sam's hard drive are infected by either a virus or a worm or both. The number of files that are infected only by a worm is 2.5 times the number of files that are infected by both a virus and a worm. If 50% of the files were not infected by a virus, how many of Sam's files were NOT infected by a worm?
Choices:
  A: 50
  B: 70
  C: 75
  D: 100
  E: 125
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's use a Venn diagram to represent the information given in the problem.
  Let's use the following variables:
    - w: number of files infected only by a worm
    - v: number of files infected only by a virus
    - b: number of files infected by both a virus and a worm
  From the problem, we know that:
    - w = 2.5b
    - v + w + b = 250
    - v = 0.5(250) = 125 (since 50% of the files were not infected by a virus)
  We can use the first two equations to substitute for w and b in terms of v:
    - w = 2.5b = 2.5(250 - v - b)
    - b = (250 - v - w)/2.5 = (250 - v - 2.5b)/2.5
  Substituting these expressions for w and b into the equation v + w + b = 250, we get:
    - v + 2.5b + (250 - v - 2.5b)/2.5 = 250
    - 2.5v + 5b + 250 - 2v - 5b = 625
    - 0.5v = 125
    - v = 250/2 = 125
  Therefore, there are 125 files that are not infected by a virus.
  We can use the equation w = 2.5b to find that b = 50.
  We can use the equation v + w + b = 250 to find that w = 75.
  Therefore, there are 75 files that are not infected by a worm.

    - b = (250 - v - w)/2.5 = (250 - v - 2.5b)/2.5
  Substituting these expressions for w and b into the equation v + w + b = 250, we get:
    - v + 2.5b + (250 - v - 2.5b)/2.5 = 250
    - 2.5v + 5b + 250 - 2v - 5b = 625
    - 0.5v = 125
    - v = 250/2 = 125
  Therefore, there are 125 files that are not infected by a virus.
  We can use the equation w = 2.5b to find that b = 50.
  We can use the equation v + w + b = 250 to find that w = 75.

  E: 75
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's call the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday "x".
  The hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does the rest of the days of the week, so it orders "2y" newspapers on the other days.
  The cost of x newspapers on Sunday is 4x dollars.
  The cost of 2y newspapers on the other days is 2y dollars.
  The total cost of newspapers per week is 210 dollars.
  We can write an equation: 4x + 6y = 210 (since there are 7 days in a week and the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each of the other 6 days).
  We need to find y, the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Monday.
  We can solve for y and then multiply by 2 to find x, the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday.
  First, we can simplify the equation: 2x + 3y = 105.
  We know that x = 2y, so we can substitute: 2(2y) + 3y = 105.
  Solving for y: 7y = 105, y = 15.

  The cost of x newspapers on Sunday is 4x dollars.
  The cost of 2y newspapers on the other days is 2y dollars.
  The total cost of newspapers per week is 210 dollars.
  We can write an equation: 4x + 6y = 210 (since there are 7 days in a week and the hotel orders twice as many newspapers on Sunday as it does on each of the other 6 days).
  We need to find y, the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Monday.
  We can solve for y and then multiply by 2 to find x, the number of newspapers the hotel orders on Sunday.
  First, we can simplify the equation: 2x + 3y = 105.
  We know that x = 2y, so we can substitute: 2(2y) + 3y = 105.
  Solving for y: 7y = 105, y = 15.
  Therefore, the hotel orders 15 newspapers on Monday.

Question: Allen starts from X, goes to Y. At the same time Bob starts from Y and goes towards X. Once Allen reaches Y he changes his direction and returns to X. Once Bob reaches X, he changes his direction and returns to Y. Throughout Allen travels at 54 kmph and Bob travels at 78kmph. By the time they meet for the second time, Bob covers 48 km more than Allen. Find the distance between X and Y.
Choices:
  A: 144km
  B: 72 km
  C: 126km
  D: 84 km

  Let's assume the distance between X and Y is d km.
  Let's assume the time taken by both Allen and Bob to meet for the second time is t hours.
  Let's assume the distance covered by Allen from X to Y is x km.
  Therefore, the distance covered by Bob from Y to X is (d - x) km.
  The time taken by Allen to cover x km is (x/54) hours.
  The time taken by Bob to cover (d - x) km is ((d - x)/78) hours.
  The time taken by Allen to cover the remaining (d - x) km is ((d - x)/54) hours.
  The time taken by Bob to cover the remaining x km is (x/78) hours.
  The total time taken by Allen to meet Bob for the second time is (x/54) + ((d - x)/54) hours.
  The total time taken by Bob to meet Allen for the second time is (x/78) + ((d - x)/78) hours.
  As both Allen and Bob meet for the second time, the total time taken by both of them should be equal.
  Therefore, (x/54) + ((d - x)/54) = (x/78) + ((d - x)/78)
  Solving the above equation, we get x = (d/3)

Question: A jeep travels a certain distance taking 6 hours in the forward journey. During the return journey, it increased its speed by 12km/hr and took 4 hours. What is the distance travelled by the jeep?
Choices:
  A: 126km
  B: 144km
  C: 127km
  D: 228km
  E: 128km
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the forward journey is x km/hr.
  Let's use the formula: Distance = Speed x Time
  Distance covered in the forward journey = x * 6
  Let's assume the speed of the jeep in the return journey is (x+12) km/hr.
  Distance covered in the return journey = (x+12) * 4
  As the distance covered in the forward journey is equal to the distance covered in the return journey, we can equate the two equations.
  x * 6 = (x+12) * 4

Topic: Math
Question: The number of water lilies on a certain lake doubles every two days. If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies. In how many days will the lake be fully covered with lilies, if initially there were 64 water lilies on it?
Choices:
  A: 15
  B: 28
  C: 30
  D: 53
  E: 59
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of water lilies doubles every two days, then the number of lilies after n days is 2^(n/2).
  If there is exactly one water lily on the lake, it takes 60 days for the lake to be fully covered with water lilies.
  Therefore, 2^(60/2) = 2^30 = the number of lilies on the lake after 60 days if there was initially one lily.
  If initially there were 64 water lilies on the lake, then the number of lilies after n days is 64 * 2^(n/2).
  We want to find the number of days it takes for the lake to be fully covered with lilies, which means the number of lilies is equal to the number of lilies after 60 days.
  Therefore, 64 * 2^(n/2) = 2^30.
  Dividing both sides by 64, we get 2^(n/2) = 2^25.
  Taking the square of both sides, we get 2^n = 2^50.
  Therefore, n = 50.

Topic: Math
Question: A train M leaves City A at 5 am and reaches City B at 9am. Another train N leaves City B at 7am and reaches City A at 1030am. At what time do the 2 trains cross one another?
Choices:
  A: 1 hr 23 min
  B: 1 hr 15 min
  C: 1 hr 8 min
  D: 56 min
  E: 55 min
Response 0:
Thought:
  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train N's journey.
  Therefore, Train M would have traveled for (x+2) hours when they meet.
  The distance traveled by both trains is equal.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Distance = Speed x Time
  Distance traveled by Train M = S1(x+2)
  Distance traveled by Train N = S2x
  Since both trains travel the same distance, we can equate the two expressions:
  S1(x+2) = S2x
  Solving for x, we get x = 4S1/(3S2-S1)
  We can substitute the values of S1 and S2 to get x.
  Once we have x, we can add it to the start time of Train N (7am) to get the time when the two trains meet.
  Therefore, we can calculate the answer.

  Train M travels for 4 hours (5am to 9am) before it meets Train N.
  Train N travels for 3.5 hours (7am to 10:30am) before it meets Train M.
  Let's assume that the two trains meet after x hours of Train N's journey.
  Therefore, Train M would have traveled for (x+2) hours when they meet.
  The distance traveled by both trains is equal.
  Let's assume that the speed of Train M is S1 and the speed of Train N is S2.
  Distance = Speed x Time
  Distance traveled by Train M = S1(x+2)
  Distance traveled by Train N = S2x
  Since both trains travel the same distance, we can equate the two expressions:
  S1(x+2) = S2x
  Solving for x, we get x = 4S1/(3S2-S1)
  We can substitute the values of S1 and S2 to get x.
  Once we have x, we can add it to the start time of Train N (7am) to get the time when the two trains meet.
  Therefore, we can calculate the answer.
  The answer is A: 1 hr 23 min.

Question: The average (arithmetic mean) of the weight of 10 vehicles is 12.2 tons. The average weight of the group of vehicles increased by 2.6 tons after a new heavy duty truck was added to the group? What is the weight in tons of the heavy duty truck?
Choices:
  A: 40.8
  B: 41.6
  C: 42.2
  D: 43.5
  E: 44.8
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's call the weight of the new heavy duty truck "x".
  The sum of the weights of the 10 original vehicles is 10 * 12.2 = 122 tons.
  After adding the new truck, there are 11 vehicles in the group.
  The new average weight is 12.2 + 2.6 = 14.8 tons.
  The sum of the weights of all 11 vehicles is 11 * 14.8 = 162.8 tons.
  The sum of the weights of the 10 original vehicles plus the weight of the new truck is 122 + x.
  We can set up an equation: (122 + x) / 11 = 14.8
  Solving for x: 122 + x = 162.8
  x = 40.8
  Therefore, the weight of the heavy duty truck is 40.8 tons.

Question: What will be the cost of gardening 1-metre – broad boundary around a rectangular plot having perimeter of 340 metres at the rate of 10 per square metre?
Choices:
  A: 3400
  B: 1700
  C: 3440
  D: Cannot be determined
  E: None of these
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume the length of the rectangular plot is L and the breadth is B.
  The perimeter of the rectangular plot is 2(L+B) = 340 meters.
  L+B = 170 meters.
  The length of the plot covered by gardening will be L+2 and the breadth will be B+2.
  The area of the gardening plot will be (L+2)(B+2) square meters.
  The cost of gardening 1 square meter is 10 dollars.
  Therefore, the cost of gardening (L+2)(B+2) square meters will be 10(L+2)(B+2) dollars.
  We need to find the value of (L+2)(B+2).
  We know that L+B = 170 meters.
  We can write L = 170 - B.
  Substituting this value of L in the expression (L+2)(B+2), we get (170-B+2)(B+2).
  Simplifying this expression, we get (B^2 + 168B + 336).
  We need to find the value of B^2 + 168B + 336.
  We can complete the square to get (B+84)^2 - 168.
  Therefore, (B^2 + 168B + 336) = (B+84)^2 - 168.
  We know that (L+2)(B+2) = (B^2 + 168B + 336).
  Therefore, (L+2)(B+2) = (B+84)^2 - 168.
  We can substitute this value in the expression 10(L+2)(B+2) to get the final answer.

Choices:
  A: 45
  B: 48
  C: 50
  D: 55
  E: 58
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the first equation, we get S = (F - J) / 3.
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get F - J = 2(F - (F - J) / 3).
  Solving for J, we get J = (F - 30) / 3.
  Substituting this into the first equation, we get (F - 30) / 3 + S + F = 100.
  Simplifying this equation, we get F + S = 110.
  Substituting S = (F - J) / 3, we get F + (F - J) / 3 = 110.
  Substituting J = (F - 30) / 3, we get F + (F - (F - 30) / 3) / 3 = 110.
  Solving for F, we get F = 48.

  Solving for J, we get J = (F - 30) / 3.
  Substituting this into the first equation, we get (F - 30) / 3 + S + F = 100.
  Simplifying this equation, we get F + S = 110.
  Substituting S = (F - J) / 3, we get F + (F - J) / 3 = 110.
  Substituting J = (F - 30) / 3, we get F + (F - (F - 30) / 3) / 3 = 110.
  Solving for F, we get F = 48.
  Therefore, the age of Joe's father is 48.
  The answer is B: 48.

Response 7:
Thought:
  Let's assume Joe's age is J, Joe's sister's age is S, and Joe's father's age is F.
  We know that J + S + F = 100.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father, Joe's sister will be twice as old as now.
  This means that F - J = S + (S * 2) = 3S.
  We also know that when Joe is as old as his father then his father is twice as old as when his sister was as old as her father.
  This means that F - J = 2(F - S).
  We can use these two equations to solve for S and F.
  Simplifying the first equation, we get S = (F - J) / 3.
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get F - J = 2(F - (F - J) / 3).

### Temperature: 0.0 | Problem 95 of 100 ###
Topic: Math
Question: Kevin drove from A to B at a constant speed of 70 mph. Once he reached B, he turned right around with pause, and returned to A at a constant speed of 90 mph. Exactly 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it. What is the distance between A and B?
Choices:
  A: 180
  B: 90
  C: 270
  D: 360
  E: None of the above
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's call the distance between A and B "d".
  Let's call the time it takes Kevin to travel from A to B "t".
  We know that Kevin's speed from A to B is 70 mph, so we can use the formula distance = speed x time to get d = 70t.
  We also know that Kevin's speed from B to A is 90 mph, so the time it takes him to travel from B to A is also "t".
  We know that 3 hours before the end of his trip, he was still approaching B, only 70 miles away from it.
  This means that at that point, he had already traveled a distance of d - 70 miles.
  We can use the formula distance = speed x time again to get d - 70 = 90(t - 3).
  We now have two equations with two variables, which we can solve for "d".
  Solving for "t" in the first equation, we get t = d/70.
  Substituting this into the second equation, we get d - 70 = 90((d/70) - 3).
  Simplifying this equation, we get d = 630.
  Therefore, the distance between A and B is 630 miles.

  Let's assume the 5 digit number is "abcde".
  According to the problem, if we add 1 after the number, it becomes "abcde1" and it is three times as large as it would be with a 1 before it, which is "1abcde".
  So, we can write the equation as 3(1abcde) = abcde1.
  Multiplying 3 with "1abcde" gives us 300000 + 3abcde.
  Therefore, the equation becomes 300000 + 3abcde = abcde1.

  For each additional quarter mile, the cab charges 10 cents, which means it charges 40 cents for each mile.
  Therefore, we can write the following equation: 0.40(x - 0.25) = 5.00 - 3.50
  Solving for x, we get x = 12.75 miles.
  Therefore, the maximum distance we can travel with $8.50 is 12.75 miles.

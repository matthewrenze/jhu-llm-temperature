### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: twenty one.Standard antibiotics usually contain only one active ingredient, while herbal antibacterial drugs contain many.Therefore, herbal medicines are more likely to maintain their effectiveness than standard antibiotics when fighting new resistant bacteria.For the strain, it is difficult to develop resistance to herbal medicines, just as it is difficult for a chef to make a dish that can satisfy the taste of dozens of guests at the same time, and it is much easier to make a dish that meets the taste of one guest.
Question: Which of the following ways of reasoning is most similar to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: If you have a large deposit in the bank, your purchasing power will be strong.If your purchasing power is strong, you will be happy.Therefore, if your bank has a large amount of deposits, you will be happy.
  B: A full-term baby has a certain instinct reaction after birth that will disappear by 2 months.The baby has been 3 months old, and there is this instinctive reaction.Therefore, this baby was not born at full term.
  C: Depending on the size, the supermarket may require 1 to 3 security guards to prevent theft.If any supermarket decides to use 3 security guards, then it must be a big supermarket.
  D: Electric current passes through wires as water flows through pipes.Since a large-diameter pipeline has a larger flow rate than a small-diameter pipeline, a thicker wire has a larger amount of electricity than a thin wire.
Response 0:
Thought:

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A study shows that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.151 women were surveyed.Of the women who said they often eat celery, 95% said they rarely have aggressive feelings or are irritated.Among women who do not eat celery often, 53% report that they often have anxiety, anger and combative emotions.
Question: The following statements all weaken the conclusions above, except
Choices:
  A: Those women who often eat celery pay more attention to fitness, and fitness consumes a lot of physical energy, is very tired, and suppresses the aggressive mood.
  B: Female interviewees are susceptible to hints and are more willing to cooperate.They will cooperate with researchers intentionally or unintentionally to answer questions in the direction they want.
  C: Like the effect of placebo, eating celery will suppress the aggressive mood, which stimulated a series of psychological and mental activities of female respondents and made them feel less aggressive.
  D: Celery has the effects of calming the liver, clearing away heat, removing annoyance and reducing swelling, detoxifying the lungs, strengthening the stomach and blood, lowering blood pressure, and brain sedation.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks for the statement that does not weaken the conclusion.
  The conclusion is that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.
  Statement A suggests that the reason why women who eat celery often rarely have aggressive feelings is because they are tired from exercising, not because of the celery.
  Statement B suggests that the female interviewees may have answered the questions in a way that they thought the researchers wanted them to answer.
  Statement C suggests that the effect of eating celery on suppressing aggressive emotions may be due to a placebo effect.
  Statement D provides additional benefits of celery, but it does not weaken the conclusion that eating celery helps to suppress aggressive emotions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Celery has the effects of calming the liver, clearing away heat, removing annoyance and reducing swelling, detoxifying the lungs, strengthening the stomach and blood, lowering blood pressure, and brain sedation.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: About 12,000 years ago, when the climate warmed, humans began to come to North America.At the same time, large mammals, such as mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers, became extinct from their once widespread North American soil.Therefore, contrary to the myth that humans lived in peace with other creatures in nature, as early as 12,000 years ago, human activities led to the extinction of these animals.
Question: Which of the following statements is the most vulnerable to the above argument?
Choices:
  A: This argument excludes humanity from nature without reflection.
  B: The arrival of humans in North America may also lead to the extinction of animals other than mastodons, mammoths, and saber-toothed tigers.
  C: The extinction of large mammals such as mastodons, mammoths and saber-toothed tigers was of extraordinary significance to the primitive people of early North America.
  D: The evidence presented is equally applicable to two alternative hypotheses? climate change has led to the extinction of large mammals, and the same reasons have led humans to travel across North America.

Context: Why did ancient Greece have a city-state system, but there was a long-standing monarchy in Eastern countries? Aristotle believes that the monarchy is often seen among barbarians and is very close to the tyrant or tyrant system.Because the nature of the barbarian people is inherently more national and more enslaved than Greece, and the slavishness of the Asian barbarians is more than that of the Europa barbarians, so they are subject to dictatorship and do not rebel.
Question: If the following statements are true, all but one can weaken Aristotle ’s interpretation
Choices:
  A: City-state manufacturing has brought about the autonomy of citizens, and the monarchy has created the slavery of Shunmin.
  B: The difference in geographical environment has created the difference between the city-state system and the monarchy

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: European fern is a poisonous wild grass that has spread and destroyed many pastures in the northern hemisphere in recent years.One way to deal with this wild grass is to spend less money and be self-sustaining by introducing the natural enemy of this plant.Therefore, some scientists suggested that the moths that feed on the European fern produced in the southern hemisphere were released into the northern hemisphere affected by this wild grass to control the growth of the European fern.
Question: If the scientist ’s proposal to control the European fern is adopted, which of the following is necessary for its success?
Choices:
  A: This northern fern of the northern hemisphere also grows in areas with similar climate and soil conditions in the southern hemisphere.
  B: In addition to eating European ferns, the moths they stock also eat other wild grasses that grow in the northern hemisphere.
  C: The stocked moths can survive in the northern hemisphere and can form a large enough group to reduce the number of European ferns and prevent their growth.
  D: When the number of European ferns decreases, livestock will become immune to diseases caused by this wild grass.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: In a cooking competition, the chef is required to make one hot dish and one cold dish, and the results are evaluated as "top grade", "middle grade", and "bottom grade".If each result of the chef is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, it is said that "Chef A is more skilled than Chef B".There are a number of existing chefs, none of them is more skilled than the other, and no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
Question: How many chefs can meet the above conditions?
Choices:
  A: unconfirmed
  B: 9 people
  C: 6 people
  D: 3 people
Response 0:
Thought:
  There are no two people with the same hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there is only one person who can make it.
  Therefore, there are 9 chefs in total.
  If no two people have the same results, then each chef must have a different result.
  Therefore, there must be 3 chefs with top grade, 3 chefs with middle grade, and 3 chefs with bottom grade.
  If no chef is more skilled than the other, then for each chef, there must be at least one other chef who has the same result for both hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, for each chef, there must be 2 other chefs who have the same result for both hot and cold dishes.
  There are 3 chefs with top grade, 3 chefs with middle grade, and 3 chefs with bottom grade.
  Therefore, each grade must have 1 chef with top hot and cold dishes, 1 chef with middle hot and cold dishes, and 1 chef with bottom hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 3 chefs who can meet the above conditions.
  The answer is D: 3 people.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  There are no two people with the same hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there is only one possible grade (top, middle, or bottom).
  Therefore, there are 3^9 possible outcomes.
  However, there are multiple chefs, and none of them can be more skilled than the others.
  Therefore, there must be an equal number of chefs in each possible grade.
  There are 3 possible grades, so there must be 3n chefs for some integer n.
  The total number of chefs is therefore a multiple of 3.
  The only answer choice that is a multiple of 3 is 6.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  There are no two people with the same hot and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there is only one person who can make it.
  Therefore, there are 9 chefs in total.
  If no two people have the same results, then each chef must have a different combination of top, middle, and bottom grades.
  If no one is more skilled than the other, then each chef must have the same number of top, middle, and bottom grades as any other chef.
  Therefore, there must be 3 chefs with top grades, 3 chefs with middle grades, and 3 chefs with bottom grades.
  The answer is D: 3 people. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  There are no two people with the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different hot and cold dishes in total.
  For each hot and cold dish, there is only one chef who can make it.
  Therefore, there are 9 chefs in total.
  If no two people have the same skill level, then each chef must be more skilled than 8 other chefs.
  Therefore, each chef must have a top grade in at least one dish and a middle grade in the other dish.
  If each chef has a top grade in one dish and a middle grade in the other dish, then each chef is more skilled than 8 other chefs and not less skilled than any other chef.
  Therefore, all 9 chefs can meet the above conditions.
  The answer is B: 9 people.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes, then there are 9 unique combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  If no chef is more skilled than the other, then each chef must have the same number of top, middle, and bottom grades.
  If Chef A is more skilled than Chef B, then Chef A must have at least one more top grade than Chef B.
  If each chef has the same number of top grades, then no chef can be more skilled than another.
  Therefore, the number of chefs that can meet the above conditions is the number of ways to divide 9 unique combinations of hot and cold dishes into groups of 3, where each group has the same number of top grades.
  There are only 3 ways to do this: (3,3,3), (4,2,3), and (5,2,2).
  Therefore, the answer is D: 3 people. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The question states that no two people have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there are 3 possible grades: "top grade", "middle grade", and "bottom grade".
  Since no two people have the same dishes, each chef can only get one of the 3 possible grades for each dish.
  Therefore, there are a total of 27 possible grades.
  Since there are no two people with the same grades, there can be at most 27 chefs.
  However, the question states that no chef is more skilled than the other.
  This means that there cannot be more than one chef with the same set of grades.
  Therefore, the maximum number of chefs that can meet the above conditions is 27.
  However, we do not know if there are actually 27 chefs who meet the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: unconfirmed.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  There are no two people who have the same hot dishes and cold dishes.
  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there is only one possible result: top grade, middle grade, or bottom grade.
  Since no two people have the same result, there can be at most 3 people who get the top grade, 3 people who get the middle grade, and 3 people who get the bottom grade.
  If there are 3 people who get the top grade, then there can be no more people who get the middle or bottom grade.
  Therefore, there can be at most 3 people who get the top grade.
  Similarly, there can be at most 3 people who get the middle grade, and at most 3 people who get the bottom grade.
  Since there are no chefs who are more skilled than the others, there can be no more than 3 chefs who get the top grade, no more than 3 chefs who get the middle grade, and no more than 3 chefs who get the bottom grade.
  Therefore, the total number of chefs who can meet the above conditions is 3+3+3=9.
  The answer is B: 9 people.
Action: Answer("B")

  Therefore, there are 9 different combinations of hot and cold dishes.
  For each combination, there is only one person who can make it.
  Therefore, there are 9 chefs in total.
  Since no two people have the same hot and cold dishes, and no one is more skilled than the other, all 9 chefs meet the above conditions.
  The answer is B: 9 people.
Action: Answer("B")

  If no two people have the same results, then each chef must have a different result.
  Therefore, there is only one chef who can get the top grade, one chef who can get the bottom grade, and the remaining 7 chefs must get the middle grade.
  If each result of Chef A is not lower than that of Chef B, and at least one item is higher than Chef B, then Chef A is more skilled than Chef B.
  Since there are 9 chefs and no two people have the same results, each chef can be compared with 8 other chefs.
  Therefore, each chef can be more skilled than at most 8 other chefs.
  However, there is no chef who is more skilled than all other chefs.
  Therefore, there is no chef who meets the above conditions.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Zhang Qiang? When the economy in a region is sluggish, many people are unemployed, so they reduce their living expenses, resulting in more unemployment and worsening the economy.The economy continued to deteriorate, and finally prices fell to the lowest point.Low prices have stimulated people to increase their living consumption, and increased consumption has led to improved economic conditions.Li Ming? If people are unemployed, they will not be able to increase their consumption, nor will they have the money to buy goods other than the necessities of life.Therefore, falling prices to the lowest point will not lead to an improvement in economic conditions.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one can best weaken Li Ming's rebuttal to Zhang Qiang?
Choices:
  A: After the economic situation improves, the company will hire more people, and many people who are reemployed will buy the goods that have been delayed.

  Option D is incorrect because there is no information in the statement to support this claim.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The statement says that the demand for W University is flexible.
  Elastic demand means that a small change in price causes a large change in the quantity demanded.
  The statement also says that the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006 despite a 20% reduction in tuition fees.
  This means that the decrease in price led to an increase in the quantity demanded, which indicates that the demand for W University is elastic.
  Therefore, the correct answer should be related to the characteristics of elastic demand.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The statement says that if the price change causes the total income and price to reverse, then demand is elastic.
  In 2007, although the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  This means that the demand for W University is elastic.
  Option A is incorrect because it says that if changes in prices result in changes in total income and prices in the same direction, then demand is elastic, which is not true.
  Option B is incorrect because it is not necessarily true that a 20% reduction in tuition fees will bring better economic benefits to W University.
  Option C is incorrect because it says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices, which is not true.
  Option D is irrelevant to the given statement.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The statement says that if the price change causes the total income and price to reverse, then demand is elastic.
  The statement also says that in 2007, although the tuition fees of W University decreased by 20%, the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006.
  This means that the demand for W University is flexible.
  Therefore, the correct statement must be related to the elasticity of demand.
  Option A is incorrect because it says that if changes in prices result in changes in total income and prices in the same direction, then demand is elastic, which is not true.
  Option B is incorrect because it is not related to the elasticity of demand.
  Option C is correct because it says that if demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices, which is true.
  Option D is incorrect because it is not related to the elasticity of demand.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The statement says that if the total income and price reverse, then demand is elastic.
  The statement also says that the total tuition fees received by W University increased from 2006, even though the tuition fees decreased by 20%.
  This means that the demand for W University is elastic.
  Therefore, the correct statement must be related to the characteristics of elastic demand.
  Statement A is incorrect because it contradicts the definition of elastic demand.
  Statement B is not necessarily true based on the information given.
  Statement C is true based on the definition of elastic demand.
  Statement D is not necessarily true based on the information given.
  Therefore, the answer is C: If demand is elastic, then price changes will cause total income to change in the same direction as prices.

(1) G must be performed in the third week.(2) O and S cannot perform continuously.(3) K must be arranged before J and S.(4) F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
Question: If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then which week must R be scheduled?
Choices:
  A: the second week
  B: Fourth week
  C: fifth week
  D: Seventh week
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  We also know that G must be performed in the third week, so it cannot be performed in the sixth week.
  K must be arranged before J and S, so K cannot be performed in the sixth week.
  F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, so if J is performed in the seventh week, then F must be performed in the sixth week.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled in the fourth week.
  The answer is B: Fourth week.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for the fourth or fifth week.
  If F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K must be scheduled before J, then K must be scheduled for the fifth week and J must be scheduled for the sixth week.
  Since O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week, then O must be scheduled for the second week.
  Since G must be performed in the third week, then G cannot be scheduled for the first or second week.
  Therefore, G must be scheduled for the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh week.
  Since R has not been scheduled yet, and there are no restrictions on when R can be scheduled, then R can be scheduled for the second, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh week.
  However, since G cannot be scheduled for the first or second week, and O must be scheduled for the second week, then R cannot be scheduled for the second week.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh week.
  The answer is either B: Fourth week, C: fifth week, D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, K cannot be scheduled for the seventh week either.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  The answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  If F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, then they must be scheduled in either the first and second weeks or the sixth and seventh weeks.
  If G is performed in the third week, then K must be scheduled before the third week.
  If K must be arranged before J and S, then K must be scheduled in either the first or second week.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled in the fourth week.
  The answer is B: Fourth week.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since there are only 7 weeks, O must be scheduled for either the first, second, fourth, or fifth week.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be performed in the third week.
  From condition (3), we know that K must be arranged before J and S.
  From condition (4), we know that F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks.
  If O is scheduled for the first week, then K must be scheduled for the second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and fifth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which violates condition (2).
  If O is scheduled for the second week, then K must be scheduled for the first week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and fifth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which violates condition (2).
  If O is scheduled for the fourth week, then K must be scheduled for the first or second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fifth and sixth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which satisfies all conditions.
  If O is scheduled for the fifth week, then K must be scheduled for the first or second week, and J and S must be scheduled for the fourth and sixth weeks in some order. This means that R must be scheduled for the seventh week, which satisfies all conditions.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week if S is scheduled for the sixth week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then K must be scheduled for the fourth or fifth week.
  If F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks, and K must be scheduled before J and S, then K cannot be scheduled for the fifth week.
  Therefore, K must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  Since G must be performed in the third week, and K must be scheduled before J and S, then G must be scheduled for the first week, and K must be scheduled for the fourth week, and J must be scheduled for the fifth week.
  Since O and S cannot perform continuously, and S is scheduled for the sixth week, then O must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the second week.
  The answer is A: the second week.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the seventh week.
  Since K must be arranged before J and S, K cannot be scheduled for the seventh week either.
  Therefore, R must be scheduled for the seventh week.
  The answer is D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If S is scheduled for the sixth week, then we know that O cannot be scheduled for the fifth week, because O and S cannot perform continuously.
  Therefore, O must be scheduled for the fourth week.
  According to condition (3), K must be arranged before J and S. Since S is scheduled for the sixth week, K must be scheduled for the fourth week, and J must be scheduled for the fifth week.
  According to condition (4), F and J must be arranged to perform in two consecutive weeks. Since J is scheduled for the fifth week, F must be scheduled for the fourth or sixth week.
  If F is scheduled for the fourth week, then R must be scheduled for the second week, because G must be performed in the third week.
  If F is scheduled for the sixth week, then R must be scheduled for the seventh week, because there is no other week available.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: the second week or D: Seventh week.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 28 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: There are 6 warehouses in a warehouse, in order from 1 to 6.There are 6 kinds of goods F, G, L, M, P, T.Each warehouse stores exactly one of 6 kinds of goods, and different kinds of goods cannot be stored in the same warehouse.The following conditions must also be met when storing goods? (1) The warehouse number for storing G is larger than that for storing L (2) The warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T.(3) The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F.(4) The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P.
Question: Which of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M
  B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M
  C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L
  D: The warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram of the warehouses and the goods stored in them.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statements must be false.
  (1) The warehouse storing G is larger than that for storing L. This means that G must be stored in warehouse 5 or 6, and L must be stored in warehouse 1-4.
  (2) The warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. This means that L must be stored in warehouse 4-6, and T must be stored in warehouse 1-3.
  (3) The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F. This means that P must be stored in warehouse 4-6, and F must be stored in warehouse 1-3.
  (4) The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. This means that T and P must be stored in adjacent warehouses.
  Using these conditions, we can create a diagram:
  
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | F | T | P |   | L | G |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
  
  From the diagram, we can see that statement (C) must be false, since P and L are not stored in adjacent warehouses.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram of the warehouses and the goods stored in them.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statements must be false.
  If F is next to M, then F must be in warehouse 1 or 6, and M must be in warehouse 2 or 5.
  If G is next to M, then G must be in warehouse 4 or 5, and M must be in warehouse 3 or 6.
  If P is next to L, then P must be in warehouse 4 or 5, and L must be in warehouse 3 or 6.
  If L is next to F, then L must be in warehouse 5, and F must be in warehouse 4 or 6.
  Therefore, the statement that must be false is C: The warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the goods in the warehouses.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statement must be false.
  If the warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M, then F and M must be in warehouses 1 and 2 in some order.
  However, this would mean that P and T cannot be next to each other, which contradicts condition (4).
  Therefore, statement A must be false.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the goods in the warehouses.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statement must be false.
  If F is next to M, then F must be in warehouse 1 or 6, and M must be in warehouse 2 or 5.
  If G is next to M, then G must be in warehouse 4 or 5, and M must be in warehouse 3 or 6.
  If P is next to L, then P must be in warehouse 4 or 5, and L must be in warehouse 3 or 6.
  If L is next to F, then L must be in warehouse 5, and F must be in warehouse 4.
  The only statement that cannot be true is C, because P and L cannot be in adjacent warehouses.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram and eliminate the options that are false.
  From condition (1), we know that G is stored in a warehouse with a larger number than L.
  From condition (2), we know that L is stored in a warehouse with a larger number than T.
  From condition (3), we know that P is stored in a warehouse with a larger number than F.
  From condition (4), we know that T is stored in a warehouse next to P.
  We can use these conditions to create a diagram and eliminate the options that are false.
  Option A is not mentioned in any of the conditions, so it could be true or false.
  Option B is not possible because G cannot be stored next to M since they are different kinds of goods.
  Option C is not possible because P cannot be stored next to L since P is stored in a warehouse with a larger number than L.
  Option D is not possible because L cannot be stored next to F since L is stored in a warehouse with a larger number than F.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the goods in the warehouses.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statement must be false.
  If F is next to M, then F must be in warehouse 1 or 6, and M must be in warehouse 2 or 5.
  If G is next to M, then G must be in warehouse 5 or 6, and M must be in warehouse 4 or 5.
  If P is next to L, then P must be in warehouse 4 or 5, and L must be in warehouse 2 or 3.
  If L is next to F, then L must be in warehouse 3 or 4, and F must be in warehouse 1 or 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that T must be in warehouse 4 and P must be in warehouse 5.
  Therefore, statement C must be false because P is not next to L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the goods in the warehouses.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statement must be false.
  If the warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M, then F and M must be in warehouses 1 and 2 in some order.
  However, this would mean that the warehouse storing P must be in warehouse 6, which would violate condition (3).
  Therefore, statement A must be false.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram to represent the placement of the goods in the warehouses.
  From the diagram, we can determine which statement must be false.
  If the warehouse storing F is next to the warehouse storing M, then F and M must be in warehouses 1 and 2, but this violates condition (3) because P must be in a warehouse with a larger number than F.
  If the warehouse storing G is next to the warehouse storing M, then G and M must be in warehouses 1 and 2, but this violates condition (1) because the warehouse storing G must have a larger number than the warehouse storing L.
  If the warehouse storing P is next to the warehouse storing L, then P and L must be in warehouses 1 and 2, but this violates condition (3) because P must be in a warehouse with a larger number than F.
  If the warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F, then L and F must be in warehouses 1 and 2, but this violates condition (2) because the warehouse storing L must have a larger number than the warehouse storing T.
  Therefore, the statement that must be false is D: The warehouse storing L is next to the warehouse storing F.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A street comprehensive governance committee has 6 members? F, G, H, I, M and P.Each of these members must be a member of at least one of the three sub-committees under the Comprehensive Governance Committee.Each sub-committee is composed of 3 different members.The known information is as follows? one of the six members serves as a member of three subcommittees.F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
Question: Which of the following statements must be true?
Choices:
  A: M and P are members of a subcommittee.
  B: F and H are members of a subcommittee.
  C: G and I are members of a subcommittee.
  D: 1 member of any sub-committee.
Response 0:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not on the same subcommittee as G, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  If H is not on the same subcommittee as I, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  Therefore, there must be at least one sub-committee with F, one with G, one with H, and one with I.
  Since each sub-committee has three members, and there are only six members total, each member must be on exactly one sub-committee.
  Therefore, M and P must be on the same sub-committee, and the only sub-committee left is the one with F, G, and H.
  Therefore, F and H are members of a subcommittee.
  The statement "F and H are members of a subcommittee" must be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not in the same subcommittee as G, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  If H is not in the same subcommittee as I, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each sub-committee must have one member who serves on three sub-committees.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is F, G, and I serving on three different sub-committees, and H, M, and P each serving on one sub-committee.
  From this, we can conclude that F and I are not in the same subcommittee, and G and H are not in the same subcommittee.
  Therefore, the statement "G and I are members of a subcommittee" cannot be true.
  The statement "M and P are members of a subcommittee" could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  The statement "F and H are members of a subcommittee" could be true, but it is not necessarily true.
  The statement "1 member of any sub-committee" is true, but it is not a particularly useful or interesting statement.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not on the same subcommittee as G, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  If H is not on the same subcommittee as I, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each sub-committee must have exactly two members who are not on any other sub-committee.
  Therefore, the only possible sub-committee assignments are:
  F, G, I
  H, M, P
  or
  F, H, M
  G, I, P
  From these assignments, we can see that:
  A: M and P are members of a subcommittee. (True)
  B: F and H are members of a subcommittee. (True)
  C: G and I are members of a subcommittee. (True)
  D: 1 member of any sub-committee. (False, since all members must be on at least one sub-committee)
Action: Answer("ABC")
Response 3:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not on the same subcommittee as G, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  If H is not on the same subcommittee as I, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each sub-committee must have exactly two members who are not on any other sub-committee.
  Therefore, the only possible sub-committee assignments are:
  - F, G, and I are each on different sub-committees.
  - H, M, and P are each on different sub-committees.
  - One member is on all three sub-committees, and the other three members are each on different sub-committees.
  From these possible sub-committee assignments, we can determine that statement D must be true, but we cannot determine which of the other statements must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not in the same subcommittee as G, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  If H is not in the same subcommittee as I, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each sub-committee must have one member who serves on three sub-committees.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is F, G, and I serving on three different sub-committees, and H, M, and P serving on the remaining sub-committees.
  From this, we can conclude that F and I are not in the same subcommittee, and G and H are not in the same subcommittee.
  Therefore, the statement "G and I are members of a subcommittee" cannot be true.
  The statement "M and P are members of a subcommittee" may or may not be true, as we do not have enough information to determine this.
  The statement "F and H are members of a subcommittee" must be true, as they are the only two members left who have not been paired with another member in a subcommittee.
  The statement "1 member of any sub-committee" is not a statement, but rather a fragment of a statement.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, and each sub-committee has three members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  Therefore, there must be two members who are not members of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G, and H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  Therefore, F and G, and H and I cannot be in the same subcommittee.
  Since there are only three subcommittees, one of the subcommittees must have the member who serves in three subcommittees.
  Therefore, the member who serves in three subcommittees cannot be in the same subcommittee as F or G, or H or I.
  From the above reasoning, we can conclude that M and P must be members of a subcommittee.
  Therefore, statement A must be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not on the same subcommittee as G, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  If H is not on the same subcommittee as I, then they must be on different sub-committees.
  Therefore, there are only two possible configurations for the sub-committees: FGH, I, MP or FHI, G, MP.
  In both configurations, M and P are members of a subcommittee, so statement A is true.
  In the first configuration, F and H are members of a subcommittee, so statement B is true.
  In the second configuration, G and I are members of a subcommittee, so statement C is true.
  Therefore, all of the statements must be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three different members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  If one member serves on three sub-committees, then the other five members must serve on at least one sub-committee each.
  If F is not in the same subcommittee as G, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  If H is not in the same subcommittee as I, then they must be in different sub-committees.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each sub-committee must have one member who serves on three sub-committees.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is F, G, and I serving on three different sub-committees, and H, M, and P serving on one sub-committee each.
  From this, we can conclude that F and I are not in the same sub-committee, and G and H are not in the same sub-committee.
  Therefore, the statement "G and I are members of a subcommittee" cannot be true.
  The statement "M and P are members of a subcommittee" may or may not be true, as we do not have enough information to determine which sub-committee they are in.
  The statement "F and H are members of a subcommittee" must be true, as they are the only two members left who are not in the same sub-committee as any of the other members.
  The statement "1 member of any sub-committee" is not a statement, but rather a fragment of a statement.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F and H are members of a subcommittee. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three members.
  One of the six members serves on all three sub-committees.
  F and G are not on the same sub-committee.
  H and I are not on the same sub-committee.
  If F is on a sub-committee with H or I, then G must be on the same sub-committee as F.
  Therefore, F is not on a sub-committee with H or I.
  If G is on a sub-committee with H or I, then F must be on the same sub-committee as G.
  Therefore, G is not on a sub-committee with H or I.
  The only way for each member to be on at least one sub-committee is if the member who serves on all three sub-committees is paired with three different members on each sub-committee.
  Therefore, M and P must be members of a subcommittee.
  The statement "F and H are members of a subcommittee" cannot be true because F cannot be on a sub-committee with H or I.
  The statement "G and I are members of a subcommittee" cannot be true because G cannot be on a sub-committee with H or I.
  The statement "1 member of any sub-committee" is not specific enough and does not have to be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  There are three sub-committees, each with three members.
  One of the six members serves as a member of three sub-committees.
  Therefore, there must be at least one member who serves on two sub-committees.
  F is not a member of the same subcommittee as G.
  H is not a member of the same subcommittee as I.
  There are only three sub-committees, so each member can only serve on one or two sub-committees.
  If M and P are not members of the same subcommittee, then they must be members of different subcommittees.
  If F and H are members of the same subcommittee, then they cannot be members of the same subcommittee as G, which would violate the given information.
  If G and I are members of the same subcommittee, then H would have to be a member of the same subcommittee as F, which would also violate the given information.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is D: 1 member of any sub-committee.

(1) L and P must be on duty on the same day.(2) G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.(3) If K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty.(4 ) If S is on the third day of duty, then H is on the second day of duty.
Question: If H is on duty the same day before S, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: G on the second day of duty
  B: P on duty in the second day
  C: K on duty in the first day
  D: H on duty at the first day
Response 0:
Thought:
  If H is on duty the same day before S, then H cannot be on the third day of duty.
  If H is not on the third day of duty, then condition (4) does not apply.
  If condition (4) does not apply, then G is not necessarily on the second day of duty.
  However, condition (2) still applies, which means G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.
  Therefore, if H is on duty the same day before S, then H must be on duty on the first day of the new year.
  If H is on duty on the first day of the new year, then G cannot be on duty on the first day of the new year (condition 2).
  If G is not on duty on the first day of the new year, then K must be on duty on the first day of the new year (condition 3).
  If L and P are on duty on the same day (condition 1), and P is not on duty on the first day of the new year, then P must be on duty on the second day of the new year.
  Therefore, if H is on duty the same day before S, then K must be on duty in the first day, P must be on duty in the second day, and G must be on duty in the third day.
  The answer is C: K on duty in the first day.

  Therefore, if H is on duty the same day before S, then H must be on duty on the first day and G must be on duty on the second day.
  This satisfies conditions (2) and (3).
  Also, since L and P must be on duty on the same day, and there are only two people on duty each day, then K and S must be on duty on the third day.
  Therefore, P cannot be on duty on the second day.
  The answer is A: G on the second day of duty.

  If L and P must be on duty on the same day, then P cannot be on duty on the second day.
  If P is not on duty on the second day, then B is not true.
  If K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty, but we don't know if K is on the first day of duty.
  If K is not on the first day of duty, then C is not true.

  From condition (2), G and H cannot be on duty on the same day.
  Therefore, G cannot be on the second day of duty.
  From condition (3), if K is on the first day of duty, then G is on the second day of duty.
  Therefore, K cannot be on the first day of duty.

Context: It is no longer new for college students to take vacation as a nanny.A survey showed that 63% of the respondents favored college students as nanny, but when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny, nearly 60% said "no".
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can reasonably explain the seemingly contradictory phenomenon?
Choices:
  A: Among those who choose to "will invite college students to be nanny", 75% intend to let college students work as tutors or secretaries, and only 25% want college students to do housework.
  B: 62% of the people in the survey indicated that they were only willing to pay a monthly salary of 800 yuan to 1,000 yuan for the college nanny.
  C: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services.
  D: Among those who do not approve of college students being nanny, 40% believe that students should choose a field related to their major in practice.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The survey shows that 63% of respondents favored college students as nanny, but nearly 60% said "no" when asked if they would ask college students to be nanny.
  There seems to be a contradiction between the two statements.
  We need to find a statement that can reasonably explain this contradiction.
  Option A talks about the type of work that college students are willing to do, but it does not explain the contradiction.
  Option B talks about the salary that people are willing to pay, but it does not explain the contradiction.
  Option C suggests that people who favor college students as nanny think that college students should do housekeeping work, but people who do not approve of college students as nanny think that college students should focus on their major.
  This statement can explain the contradiction because it suggests that people who favor college students as nanny have a different expectation of what college students should do as nanny than those who do not approve of college students as nanny.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Among those who favor college students as nanny, 69% think that doing housekeeping work is good for college students themselves, and only 31% think that college students nanny can provide better housekeeping services.

  The statement also mentions that heavier elements like carbon can only be formed in the star's nuclear reaction and diffuse when the star explodes.
  The statement further mentions that a nebula recently discovered contained carbon formed billions of years ago when the universe was no more than 1.5 billion years old.
  Therefore, it can be inferred that some stars had already formed when the universe was less than 1.5 billion years old, and the carbon in this nebula later formed part of some stars.
  The answer is D: The carbon in this nebula later formed part of some stars.

- Dr. Zhang is responsible for treating male patients only.
- Dr. Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient.
- If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child.
- J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults.
- E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.
- Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu are the only doctors left.
- Dr. Wang and Dr. Liu must be responsible for at least one patient each.
- Dr. Wang cannot be responsible for treating J or K since they are children.
- Dr. Liu cannot be responsible for treating J or K since they are children.
- Dr. Wang must be responsible for treating at least one male patient since E, F, and J are males.
- Dr. Liu must be responsible for treating at least one female patient since there are only 4 females.
- Therefore, the answer is A: Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Dr.Zhang is responsible for treating male patients, so E, F, and J must be assigned to Dr.Zhang.
  Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, so Dr.Li can only be assigned to one patient.
  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. So, J and K must be assigned to the same doctor.
  Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu must be assigned to at least one female patient and one male patient.
  Therefore, Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient, and Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient.
  So, A and D are not true.
  The answer is C: Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Dr.Zhang is responsible for treating male patients, so E, F, and J must be assigned to Dr.Zhang.
  Dr.Li can only be responsible for the treatment of 1 patient, so Dr.Li can only be assigned to one patient.
  If a doctor is responsible for treating a child patient, then he must be responsible for the treatment of an adult patient of the same sex as the child. Therefore, J and K must be assigned to the same doctor.
  Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu must be assigned to at least one female patient and one male patient, respectively.
  Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient, so A is true.
  Dr.Wang is not assigned to J or K, so Dr.Wang is not responsible for treating any child patient, so B is false.
  Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient, so C is true.
  Dr.Liu is not assigned to J or K, so Dr.Liu is not responsible for treating any child patient, so D is false.

  J and K are children, and the remaining 5 are adults.
  E, F, and J are males, and the remaining 4 are females.
  Dr.Wang and Dr.Liu have not been assigned any specific gender or age group of patients.
  Therefore, we cannot determine if Dr.Wang is responsible for treating at least one female patient or at least one child patient.
  Similarly, we cannot determine if Dr.Liu is responsible for treating at least one male patient or at least one child patient.
  The answer is either A or B.

Context: There are 7 candidates hired by Haier? F, G, H, I, W, X and Y.One of them needs to be assigned to the public relations department, three to the production department, and the other three to the sales department.The personnel allocation of these 7 employees must meet the following conditions? (1) H and Y must be allocated in the same department.(2) F and G cannot be allocated in the same department (3) If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.(4) F must be allocated in the production department.
Question: Which of the following may list the final distribution of these 7 employees?
Choices:
  A: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? F, H, Y; Sales Department? G, I, X
  B: Public Relations Department? W; Production Department? G, I, X; Sales Department? F, H, Y
  C: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, G, H; Sales Department? I, Y, W
  D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y
Response 0:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they can be in the production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department, so F cannot be in the sales department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department, so X and W cannot be in different departments.
- G and F cannot be allocated in the same department, so G cannot be in the production department.
- Based on the above conditions, we can try to list the final distribution of these 7 employees.
- If H and Y are in the production department, then F must be in the production department as well. This means that X and W must be in the sales department, and G and I must be in the public relations department. This satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- H and Y must be in the same department, so they can be in the production or sales department.
- F must be in the production department, so F cannot be in the sales department.
- G cannot be in the same department as F, so G cannot be in the production department.
- If X is in the sales department, W is in the production department, so X and W cannot be in the same department.
- Therefore, X cannot be in the production department.
- From the above deductions, we can conclude that F, H, and Y are in the production department, and G, I, and X are in the sales department. W is in the public relations department.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
- H and Y must be in the same department, so they can be in production or sales department.
- F must be in the production department.
- If X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department.
- F and G cannot be in the same department, so G cannot be in the production department with F.
- There are three employees in each department.
- Based on the above conditions, we can try to list the final distribution of these 7 employees.
- Option A: W is in the public relations department, which is not possible. Eliminate option A.
- Option B: W is in the public relations department, which is possible. G, I, and X are in the production department, which satisfies the condition. F, H, and Y are in the sales department, which satisfies the condition. Keep option B.
- Option C: X is in the public relations department, which is not possible. Eliminate option C.
- Option D: X is in the public relations department, which is possible. F, I, and W are in the production department, which satisfies the condition. G, H, and Y are in the sales department, which satisfies the condition. Keep option D.
- Both option B and option D satisfy all the conditions.
- We can check the answer by verifying the conditions.
- In option B, H and Y are in the sales department, which violates the condition. Eliminate option B.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they can be in the production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
- F and G cannot be allocated in the same department, so G cannot be in the production department.
- There are three employees in each department.
- Based on the above conditions, we can try to allocate the employees to the departments.
- F must be in the production department, and G cannot be in the production department, so G must be in the sales department.
- If X is in the sales department, W must be in the production department, so X cannot be in the sales department.
- Therefore, X must be in the production department.
- H and Y must be in the same department, so they can be in the production or sales department.
- If H and Y are in the production department, I must be in the sales department, and vice versa.
- Therefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:
  Public Relations Department: W
  Production Department: F, X, Y
  Sales Department: G, H, I
- The answer is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  H and Y must be allocated in the same department.
  F and G cannot be allocated in the same department.
  If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
  F must be allocated in the production department.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that F cannot be allocated in the sales department.
  Therefore, X must be allocated in the sales department and W must be allocated in the production department.
  H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they can be allocated in the sales department or production department.
  F must be allocated in the production department, so G and I must be allocated in the sales department.
  Therefore, the final distribution of these 7 employees is:
  Public Relations Department: None
  Production Department: F, H, Y
  Sales Department: G, I, X
  The answer is D: Public Relations Department? X; Production Department? F, I, W; Sales Department? G, H, Y
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they can be in either production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department.
- G cannot be allocated in the same department as F.
- We can start by placing F in the production department and X in the sales department.
- Then, we can place W in the production department based on the condition.
- H and Y can be placed in the sales department.
- G and I can be placed in the production department.
- Therefore, the answer is D.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department, so they can be in the production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department, so F cannot be in the sales department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. So, if X is not in the sales department, W is not in the production department.
- G and F cannot be in the same department, so G cannot be in the production department.
- From the above deductions, we can conclude that F is in the production department, and G is in the sales department.
- If H and Y are in the production department, then I and X are in the sales department, and W is in the production department.
- If H and Y are in the sales department, then I and X are in the production department, and W is in the production department.
- Therefore, the possible final distribution of these 7 employees is:
  Public Relations Department: X
  Production Department: F, I, W
  Sales Department: G, H, Y
- The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department. So, we can assume H and Y are in the production department.
- F must be allocated in the production department. So, F is in the production department.
- F and G cannot be allocated in the same department. So, G is not in the production department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. So, X and W cannot be in different departments.
- We have 3 employees left: G, I, and X. One of them must be in the sales department.
- We can assume that G is in the sales department because F and G cannot be in the same department.
- So, I and X are in the production department.
- Therefore, the final distribution is: 
  Public Relations Department: W
  Production Department: F, I, X
  Sales Department: G, H, Y
- The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department. So, H and Y can be in the production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department. So, F cannot be in the sales department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. So, if X is in the sales department, W cannot be in the sales department.
- G and F cannot be allocated in the same department. So, G cannot be in the production department.
- From the above deductions, we can conclude that F is in the production department, and G is in the sales department.
- If H and Y are in the production department, then I and X must be in the sales department, and W must be in the public relations department.
- If H and Y are in the sales department, then I and X must be in the production department, and W must be in the public relations department.
- Therefore, the possible distribution of employees is:
  - Public Relations Department: W
  - Production Department: F, H/Y, I/X
  - Sales Department: G, I/X, H/Y
- Option D is the only one that matches the above distribution.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
- H and Y must be allocated in the same department. So, H and Y can be in production or sales department.
- F must be allocated in the production department. So, F cannot be in public relations or sales department.
- If X is allocated in the sales department, W is allocated in the production department. So, X and W cannot be in different departments.
- G cannot be allocated in the same department as F. So, G cannot be in the production department.
- From the above deductions, we can conclude that F, H, and Y are in the production department and G, I, and X are in the sales department. W can be in the production department or public relations department.
- Therefore, the answer is either A or B.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge, built in 1968, has a clear height of 24 meters in the Fengshui area.Theoretically, it can pass a maximum of 3,000 tons of ships.Today, with the rapid economic development, it has become a building that “cuts the waist” of the Yangtze River waterway and hinders the passage of giant ships.A bridge expert asserted that the Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge must be demolished and rebuilt in order to dredge the golden waterways of the Yangtze River completely.
Question: If any of the following is true, can you raise the most doubts about this expert's point of view?
Choices:
  A: Due to the inability of large ships to pass through the Nanjing Bridge, a large number of exported goods in the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze River can only be taken by road or railway.
  B: 99% of international ships entering the Yangtze River are moored at ports below the Nanjing Bridge, and dozens of foreign trade terminals above Nanjing rarely have large external ships berthed.
  C: It is not enough to dismantle only the Nanjing Bridge.The Yangtze River Bridge, which was built in Wuhu, Tongling, Anqing and other places, has a clear height of 24 meters.

Topic: Logic
Context: There are 6 warehouses in a warehouse, in order from 1 to 6.There are 6 kinds of goods F, G, L, M, P, T.Each warehouse stores exactly one of 6 kinds of goods, and different kinds of goods cannot be stored in the same warehouse.The following conditions must also be met when storing goods? (1) The warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L.(2) The warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T.(3) The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F.(4) The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P.
Question: If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, how many kinds of goods are stored in the warehouse?
Choices:
  A: 2 rooms
  B: 3 rooms
  C: 4
  D: 5 rooms
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that there are 6 warehouses numbered 1 to 6.
  We know that G is stored in a warehouse with a higher number than L.
  We know that L is stored in a warehouse with a higher number than T.
  We know that P is stored in a warehouse with a higher number than F.
  We know that T is stored in a warehouse next to the warehouse where P is stored.
  We know that there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored.
  We can use these conditions to create a diagram to help us solve the problem.
  We can see that M and G are in warehouses 2 and 4, respectively.
  We can see that F and L are in warehouses 1 and 3, respectively.
  We can see that P and T are in warehouses 5 and 6, respectively.
  Therefore, there are 6 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  The answer is D: 5 rooms.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are 6 warehouses numbered from 1 to 6.
  We also know that there are 6 kinds of goods F, G, L, M, P, T.
  We need to find out how many kinds of goods are stored in the warehouse if there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored.
  From the given conditions, we know that the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L. Therefore, G cannot be stored in warehouses 1 or 2.
  We also know that the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouses 5 or 6.
  The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, T cannot be stored in warehouses 1 or 6.
  From the given condition, we know that the warehouse storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F. Therefore, P cannot be stored in warehouses 1 or 2.
  We know that there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored. Therefore, M and G cannot be stored in warehouses 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that M and G can only be stored in warehouses 3 or 4.
  Therefore, there are two kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  The answer is A: 2 rooms.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then the possible order of warehouses is:
  L _ M _ G _ T _ P _ F or F _ P _ T _ G _ M _ L
  In the first order, the warehouse where F is stored is warehouse 1, and the warehouse where L is stored is warehouse 2. Therefore, the warehouse where M is stored is warehouse 3, and the warehouse where G is stored is warehouse 5. There are two kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  In the second order, the warehouse where F is stored is warehouse 6, and the warehouse where P is stored is warehouse 5. Therefore, the warehouse where T is stored is warehouse 4, and the warehouse where G is stored is warehouse 3. There are three kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 2 rooms.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are 6 warehouses in total, and each warehouse stores exactly one of 6 kinds of goods.
  We also know that the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L, and the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T.
  Therefore, the warehouse number for storing G must be larger than the warehouse number for storing T.
  We also know that the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P.
  Therefore, the warehouse storing P must be either the 4th or the 5th warehouse.
  If the warehouse storing P is the 4th warehouse, then the warehouse storing T must be the 5th warehouse, and the warehouse storing G must be the 6th warehouse.
  If the warehouse storing P is the 5th warehouse, then the warehouse storing T must be the 4th warehouse, and the warehouse storing G must be the 6th warehouse.
  In both cases, there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored.
  Therefore, there are 2 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  The answer is A: 2 kinds of goods.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then the possible order of warehouses is as follows:
  L - T - P - M - G - F or
  T - L - P - M - G - F
  In either case, there are 4 warehouses between the warehouse where L is stored and the warehouse where G is stored.
  Therefore, there are 4 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then the possible order of warehouses is:
  L _ M _ G _ T _ P _ F or F _ P _ T _ G _ M _ L
  In the first order, the warehouse where F is stored is 1, and the warehouse where L is stored is 2. Therefore, the warehouse where M is stored is 3, and the warehouse where G is stored is 5. So there are two kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  In the second order, the warehouse where F is stored is 6, and the warehouse where P is stored is 5. Therefore, the warehouse where T is stored is 4, and the warehouse where G is stored is 3. So there are two kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  Therefore, the answer is A: 2 rooms.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then M and G must be stored in warehouses 1 and 3, in some order.
  From condition (1), we know that G must be stored in a warehouse with a larger number than the warehouse where L is stored. Therefore, G cannot be stored in warehouse 2, which means G must be stored in warehouse 3.
  From condition (2), we know that L must be stored in a warehouse with a larger number than the warehouse where T is stored. Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouse 4 or 5, which means L must be stored in warehouse 6.
  From condition (3), we know that P must be stored in a warehouse with a larger number than the warehouse where F is stored. Therefore, P cannot be stored in warehouse 1, which means P must be stored in warehouse 6.
  From condition (4), we know that T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, T must be stored in warehouse 5.
  We have now determined the location of all goods except for F. From condition (3), we know that F must be stored in warehouse 2.
  Therefore, there are 5 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored.
  We also know that the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L.
  Therefore, G cannot be stored in warehouses 1 or 2.
  We also know that the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T.
  Therefore, L cannot be stored in warehouses 1, 2, or 3.
  We also know that the warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F.
  Therefore, P cannot be stored in warehouses 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  We also know that the warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P.
  Therefore, T cannot be stored in warehouses 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  From the above, we can deduce that G can only be stored in warehouses 5 or 6.
  If G is stored in warehouse 6, then L must be stored in warehouse 5, and T must be stored in warehouse 4.
  If M is stored in warehouse 3, then F must be stored in warehouse 2, and P must be stored in warehouse 1.
  Therefore, there are 6 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  The answer is D: 5 rooms.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then the possible locations of M and G are as follows:
  M _ G or G _ M
  According to the conditions, we can deduce that:
  (1) G > L, L > T, P > F
  (2) T is next to P
  If G > L, then G cannot be in warehouses 1 or 2. Therefore, G can only be in warehouses 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  If L > T, then L cannot be in warehouses 5 or 6. Therefore, L can only be in warehouses 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  If P > F, then P cannot be in warehouses 1 or 2. Therefore, P can only be in warehouses 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  If T is next to P, then T and P must be in warehouses 3 and 4 in some order.
  If M and G are in warehouses 3 and 5 in some order, then L must be in warehouse 4, P must be in warehouse 4, and T must be in warehouse 3. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, there are 4 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.
  The answer is C: 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If there is exactly one warehouse between the warehouse where M is stored and the warehouse where G is stored, then there are only two possible arrangements: M _ G _ _ _ or _ _ M _ G _.
  According to the conditions, the warehouse number for storing G is larger than the warehouse number for storing L, and the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. Therefore, the warehouse number storing G must be larger than the warehouse number storing T.
  The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, the warehouse storing P must be larger than the warehouse storing T.
  The warehouse number storing P is larger than the warehouse number storing F. Therefore, the warehouse storing P must be larger than the warehouse storing F.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is M _ G _ _ _.
  There are 4 warehouses left for F, L, P, and T.
  According to the conditions, the warehouse number storing L is larger than the warehouse number storing T. Therefore, the warehouse storing L must be either 4 or 5.
  The warehouse storing P is larger than the warehouse storing F. Therefore, the warehouse storing P must be either 5 or 6.
  The warehouse storing T is next to the warehouse storing P. Therefore, the warehouse storing T must be either 3 or 4.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is M T G L P F.
  There are 6 kinds of goods stored in the warehouse.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: I can relate some external symbols to some inner events, for example, to associate moaning and face distortion with the feeling of pain.I learned from the pain experience that when I feel pain, I often moan and twist my face.Therefore, once I see that others have the same external signs, I take it for granted that they also have the same inner activity events as me.After all, between me and others, the behavior and normal physiological functions are obviously similar.Why aren't they similar in inner activities?
Question: Which of the following can most strongly support the above argument?

(1) There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.(2) F and G are not in charge of the same department.(3) H and I are not in charge of the same department.
Question: If F and M are not in charge of the same department, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and H are in charge of the same department.
  B: F and I are in charge of the same department.
  C: I and P are in charge of the same department.
  D: M and G are in charge of the same department.
Response 0:
Thought:
  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments cannot be F or M.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be one of H, I, or P.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then either H or I is in charge of the department that the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments is not in charge of.

  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then there is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments cannot be F or M.
  This means that F and M are each in charge of one or two departments.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then G is not in charge of the department that F is in charge of.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then I is not in charge of the department that H is in charge of.
  Therefore, F and I cannot be in charge of the same department because they have no common departments.
  This means that F and M are in charge of two departments, and I is in charge of the third department.
  If I is in charge of the third department, then P cannot be in charge of the same department as I because each department is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  Therefore, I and P are not in charge of the same department.
  This means that M and G are in charge of the same department because they are the only two general manager assistants left who have not been assigned to a department.
  Therefore, the answer is D: M and G are in charge of the same department.
Action: Answer("D")

  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then there is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments cannot be F or M.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, there are only two possibilities for the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments: either H or I.
  If F and H are in charge of the same department, then the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be I.
  If F and I are in charge of the same department, then the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be H.
  If I and P are in charge of the same department, then the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be F.
  If M and G are in charge of the same department, then the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be H.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is A: F and H are in charge of the same department.

Thought:
  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  F and G are not in charge of the same department.
  H and I are not in charge of the same department.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F and M cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  This means that the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be one of the other four: G, H, I, or P.
  Since H and I are not in charge of the same department, and F is not in charge of the same department as G, then the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be either G or P.
  If G is the assistant general manager in charge of three departments, then M and H would be in the same department, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, P must be the assistant general manager in charge of three departments.
  This means that I and P are in the same department.
  The only answer choice that is true based on this information is C: I and P are in charge of the same department.

  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then there is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments cannot be F or M.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then they are either in charge of different departments or one of them is the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then they are either in charge of different departments or one of them is the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be either F, G, H, or I.
  If F and H are in charge of the same department, then they cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If F and I are in charge of the same department, then they cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If I and P are in charge of the same department, then they cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If M and G are in charge of the same department, then they cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, none of the choices must be true.

  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F and M are each in charge of one department.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then there must be another assistant in charge of the third department.
  H and I are not in charge of the same department, so they cannot both be in charge of the third department.
  Therefore, P must be in charge of the third department.
  The answer is C: I and P are in charge of the same department.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F and M cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be one of the other four assistants: G, H, I, or P.
  From condition (2), we know that F and G are not in charge of the same department.
  From condition (3), we know that H and I are not in charge of the same department.
  Therefore, the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments must be either H, I, or P.
  If F and H are in charge of the same department, then F cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If F and I are in charge of the same department, then F cannot be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If I and P are in charge of the same department, then neither I nor P can be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  If M and G are in charge of the same department, then neither M nor G can be the assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, none of the options are true.

  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and M are in charge of different departments, then there is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, F, M, and the assistant in charge of three departments are in three different departments.
  H and I are not in charge of the same department.
  Therefore, F and I cannot be in the same department.
  The only option left is A: F and H are in charge of the same department.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  There are three departments, and each department is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F, G, H, I, M, and P are divided into three groups, each group consisting of three people, and each group is in charge of a department.
  If F and M are not in the same group, then they are in different departments.
  If F and M are in different departments, then they are in different groups.
  Therefore, F, G, and H are in one group, and I, M, and P are in another group.
  If F and I are in the same group, then they are in charge of the same department.
  If I and P are in the same group, then they are in charge of the same department.
  If M and G are in the same group, then they are in charge of the same department.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  There are three departments, each of which is in charge of three general manager assistants.
  There is only one assistant to the general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  If F and M are not in charge of the same department, then they are in charge of different departments.
  Therefore, F and M cannot be the assistant general manager in charge of three departments at the same time.
  Therefore, the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be one of the other four assistants: G, H, I, or P.
  If F and G are not in charge of the same department, then F is not the assistant general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, the assistant general manager in charge of three departments must be one of H, I, or P.
  If H and I are not in charge of the same department, then they cannot both be the assistant general manager in charge of three departments.
  Therefore, either H, I, or P is the assistant general manager in charge of three departments, and the other two assistants in that department are also in that department with the assistant general manager.
  If F and H are in charge of the same department, then F is in the same department as the assistant general manager in charge of three departments, which is not possible.
  If F and I are in charge of the same department, then F is in the same department as the assistant general manager in charge of three departments, which is not possible.
  If I and P are in charge of the same department, then I is in the same department as the assistant general manager in charge of three departments, which is possible.
  If M and G are in charge of the same department, then M is in the same department as G, which is possible but not necessarily true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: I and P are in charge of the same department.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 83 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: The battery used by the American electric vehicle TESLA consists of nearly 7000 Panasonic 18650 batteries connected in series.Large battery packs connected in parallel.The safety of the TESLA battery power system has been questioned by the automotive industry.A battery expert said that the probability of fire for 18650 batteries in the United States is 0.2 parts per million, then the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%.Based on the current sales of TESLA.this It caused a battery fire accident almost every month.
Question: If the following statement is true, which one most powerfully weakened the expert's judgment?
Choices:
  A: 18650 battery has the characteristics of large energy density, stability and good consistency
  B: Billions of 18650 batteries are produced every year in the world, and their safety level is constantly improving
  C: TESLA has a very advanced battery management system, which will automatically disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells
  D: 18650 battery can be recharged many times, so the service life of the battery is greatly extended
Response 0:
Thought:
  The expert's judgment is that the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%.
  The statement that most powerfully weakens the expert's judgment should be one that suggests that the probability of fire is higher than 0.14%.
  Choice A talks about the characteristics of the 18650 battery, but it does not suggest that the probability of fire is higher than 0.14%.
  Choice B talks about the safety level of the 18650 battery, but it does not suggest that the probability of fire is higher than 0.14%.
  Choice C suggests that TESLA has a battery management system that can disconnect the output of abnormal battery cells, which could reduce the probability of fire. Therefore, it does not weaken the expert's judgment.
  Choice D talks about the service life of the battery, but it does not suggest that the probability of fire is higher than 0.14%.
  Therefore, none of the choices most powerfully weakens the expert's judgment.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The expert's judgment is that the probability of fire for a battery pack consisting of 7,000 small batteries is 0.14%.
  The statement that most powerfully weakens the expert's judgment is the one that contradicts or undermines the expert's reasoning.
  Option A and D are irrelevant to the expert's judgment.
  Option B is not relevant to the safety of TESLA's battery power system.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: A music producer is recording 7 albums one after another? F, G, H, J, K, L and M, but it is not necessary to record in this order.When arranging the sequence of recording these 7 albums, the following conditions must be met? (l) F must be ranked second.(2) J cannot be ranked seventh.(3) G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.(4) H must be somewhere in front of L.(5) L must be somewhere before M.
Question: If M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K, which of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K seventh
  B: L third
  C: H is either in front of F or immediately after F
  D: L either immediately before G or immediately after G
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the first album must be either G, H, or L.
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so H cannot be ranked seventh.
  We also know that G cannot be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  Therefore, the first album must be L, and the second album must be F.
  The third album cannot be G or H, so it must be either J, K, or M.
  However, we know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K, so the third album must be J.
  Therefore, the fourth album must be either G or H, and the fifth album must be the other one.
  Finally, the sixth album must be K and the seventh album must be M.
  We can see that none of the choices are true based on this sequence.
  Therefore, the answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the order must be F _ _ _ _ _ _.
  We know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so the order must be F _ _ _ _ _ J.
  We know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  We know that H must be somewhere in front of L.
  Therefore, the order must be F H _ L _ _ J.
  We can see that H is not in front of F, so option C is not true.
  We can also see that L is not third, so option B is not true.
  We can see that K is not seventh, so option A is not true.
  The only option left is D, which states that L is either immediately before G or immediately after G. This is true since the order is F H _ L _ G J or F H _ G L _ J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the first album must be either G, H, or L.
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so H cannot be the first album.
  We also know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so J must be ranked either fifth or sixth.
  We also know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  Therefore, the only possible sequence is L, F, H, G, M, J, K.
  From this sequence, we can see that H is immediately after F.
  We can also see that L is immediately before G.
  Therefore, the answer is D: L either immediately before G or immediately after G. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the first album must be either G, H, or L.
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so H cannot be ranked seventh.
  We also know that G cannot be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  Therefore, the first album must be L, and the second album must be F.
  We can then deduce the following sequence: L, F, H, G, K, M, J.
  From this sequence, we can see that H is immediately after F.
  Therefore, the answer is C: H is either in front of F or immediately after F.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  From condition (2), we know that J cannot be ranked seventh.
  Therefore, J must be ranked sixth.
  From condition (5), we know that L must be ranked before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked fifth.
  From condition (4), we know that H must be somewhere in front of L.
  Therefore, H must be ranked fourth.
  From condition (3), we know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  Therefore, G must be ranked second or third.
  From condition (1), we know that F must be ranked second.
  Therefore, the only possible sequence is F, G, H, L, M, J, K.
  From this sequence, we can see that H is immediately after F.
  Therefore, the answer is C: H is either in front of F or immediately after F.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the first album must be either G, H, or L.
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so H cannot be the first album.
  We also know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so J must be ranked either fifth or sixth.
  We also know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  Therefore, the only possible sequence is L, F, H, G, M, J, K.
  From this sequence, we can see that H is immediately after F.
  We can also see that L is immediately before G.
  Therefore, the answer is D: L either immediately before G or immediately after G. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the possible order of the first two albums is (XF) where X represents any album other than F.
  We also know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so the possible order of the last two albums is (YJ) where Y represents any album other than J.
  We also know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H, so the possible order of GH is (GH) or (HG).
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so the possible order of H and L is (HL) or (LH).
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that L either immediately before G or immediately after G. 
  The answer is D: L either immediately before G or immediately after G.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the order must be F _ _ _ _ _ _.
  We know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so the order must be F _ _ _ _ _ J.
  We know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H.
  We know that H must be somewhere in front of L.
  Therefore, the order must be F H _ L _ _ J.
  From this order, we can see that L is third.
  We cannot determine whether K is seventh or not.
  We cannot determine whether H is either in front of F or immediately after F.
  We cannot determine whether L is immediately before G or immediately after G.
  Therefore, the answer is B: L third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, L must be ranked before J and K.
  We also know that F must be ranked second, so the possible order of the first two albums is (XF) where X represents any of the remaining 6 albums.
  We also know that J cannot be ranked seventh, so the possible order of the last two albums is (YJ) where Y represents any of the remaining 4 albums.
  We also know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H, so the possible order of GH is (GH) or (HG) and the remaining 3 albums can be arranged in any order.
  We also know that H must be somewhere in front of L, so the possible order of HL is (HL) or (HXL) or (HXLYL) where X and Y represent any of the remaining 3 albums.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that L either immediately before G or immediately after G. This is because we know that L must be ranked before J and K, and we know that G can neither be directly in front of H nor immediately after H, so the only possible arrangement is GL or LG.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that M is somewhere before J and somewhere before K.
  We also know that L must be somewhere before M.
  Therefore, M must be ranked first, second, or third.
  If M is ranked first, then F must be ranked second, which violates condition (1).
  If M is ranked second, then F must be ranked first, which violates condition (1).
  If M is ranked third, then F must be ranked second, which satisfies condition (1).
  If M is ranked fourth or later, then L cannot be before M, which violates condition (5).
  Therefore, M must be ranked third, and F must be ranked second.
  Since J cannot be ranked seventh, it must be ranked sixth.
  Since G cannot be directly in front of H or immediately after H, G must be ranked fourth or fifth, and H must be ranked fifth or sixth.
  Since H must be somewhere in front of L, H must be ranked fifth.
  Since L must be somewhere before M, L must be ranked fourth.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that H is either in front of F or immediately after F.
  The answer is C: H is either in front of F or immediately after F.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: When the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean decreased significantly, the number of seals increased from 1.5 million to about 2.5 million.Some people think that seals have caused a decrease in cod, but seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
Question: Which of the following statements, if true, can weaken the argument most strongly?
Choices:
  A: In the traditional cod fishing belt, a large number of seals caused great inconvenience to the fishing boat.
  B: The damage caused by seawater pollution to cod is more serious than that caused to seals.
  C: Before the number of seals increased, the number of cod in the North Atlantic Ocean was greatly reduced.
  D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The argument is that seals rarely eat cod, so it is unlikely that a large increase in the number of seals caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  To weaken the argument, we need to find a statement that suggests that seals may have caused a significant decline in the number of cod.
  Choice A is irrelevant to the argument.
  Choice B suggests that seawater pollution is more harmful to cod than seals, but it does not address the relationship between seals and cod.
  Choice C does not weaken the argument because it does not suggest that seals caused a decline in the number of cod.
  Choice D suggests that seals and cod share the same food source, which means that seals may have competed with cod for food, leading to a decline in the number of cod.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Cod almost only eat capelin, and this fish is also the main food for seals.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Logic
Context: Crimes involving the use of firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.However, most crimes involving the use of firearms did not result in homicides.Therefore, there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense in the criminal law from other criminal offenses.
Question: The logic loophole in the above argument is most similar to the following one?
Choices:
  A: Obese people are more likely to suffer from heart disease than people with normal weight.However, obese people make up a very small percentage of our population.Therefore, in our country, there is no need for the medical and health community to emphasize the risk of heart disease.
  B: Unchecked sex is more likely to be infected with AIDS than checkpoint.However, among people with unchecked sex, only a small percentage of people are infected with AIDS.Therefore, there is no need to emphasize the harm of unchecked sex in the propaganda of AIDS prevention.
  C: The prevailing view is that smoking is more likely to cause lung cancer than not smoking.However, in some countries, the proportion of people with lung cancer who have a history of smoking is not higher than the proportion of the total population who have a history of smoking.Therefore, the above popular opinion is likely to be a prejudice.
  D: High-income people are more capable of enjoying life than low-income people.But there are many high-income earners who claim to be unhappy.Therefore, those who pursue a happy life need not pay attention to the level of income.

  However, it is still true that crimes involving firearms are more likely to lead to murder than other types of crimes.
  Therefore, the conclusion that there is no need to distinguish the illegal use of firearms as a serious criminal offense is not logically sound.
  The loophole in the argument is that it ignores the fact that even if most crimes involving firearms do not result in homicides, the potential for a deadly outcome is still higher than in other types of crimes.
  This is similar to option B, where the argument ignores the fact that even if only a small percentage of people with unchecked sex are infected with AIDS, the potential for infection is still higher than in people who practice safe sex.

Context: Seven people from G, H, J, K, L, M and O traveled together.In their 4-day camping life, two people are scheduled to cook for everyone every day.It is required that the four-day staff arrangement cannot be repeated, and there is exactly one person on duty for two days.In addition, the duty arrangement must also meet the following conditions? (1) J should be placed on the next day of duty H.(2) The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day.(3) G must be on the same day as one of J and O.(4) Arrange K at least one day on the first or second day.(5) O must be on the third day.
Question: Which of the following must be ranked the next day?
Choices:
  A: G
  B: J
  C: K
  D: L
Response 0:
Thought:
  According to the conditions, we know that:
  - O must be on the third day, so the first and second days must be filled with other people.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the third day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the third day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the third day.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, and the person on duty for the first and second days must be different. So, the person on duty for the first and second days must be G, H, J, K, or L. Since G and K cannot be on the third day, they must be on the first or second day. Therefore, J must be on the third day. According to the condition that J should be placed on the next day of duty H, we know that H must be on the second day. Therefore, the person on duty for the first day must be G or K. Since G must be on the same day as one of J and O, and J is on the third day, we know that G must be on the first day. Therefore, the person on duty for the second day must be L or M. Since K cannot be on the third day, K must be on the second day. Therefore, L or M must be on the fourth day. Since K is on the second day, J must be on the third day, and the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, we know that L must be on the first day and M must be on the fourth day. Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is K.

  - O must be on the third day, so the first and second days must be filled with other people.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the third day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the third day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the third day.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, and the person on duty for the first three days must be K, L, and H in some order. Since J should be placed on the next day of duty H, J must be on the third day. Since G must be on the same day as one of J and O, G must be on the third day with O. Therefore, the person on duty for the fourth day must be either M or G. Since G has been on the third day, M must be on the fourth day. Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is J.

  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O.
  Therefore, we can deduce that:
  - On the first day, K must be arranged, and G must be arranged with J or O.
  - On the second day, L must be arranged, and the person who is not with G on the first day must be arranged with J or O.
  - On the third day, O must be arranged.
  - On the fourth day, the person on duty for two days must be arranged, and the person who is not with G on the first day must be arranged with J or O.
  Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is J.
  The answer is B: J.

  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the fourth day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the fourth day.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be either H or O. If H is on duty for two days, then J must be on the fourth day, which violates the condition that J should be placed on the next day of duty H. Therefore, O must be on duty for two days, and G must be on the same day as O. Since O is on the third day, G must be on the third day. Therefore, J must be on the fourth day, and H must be on the first day. Then, K and L can be arranged on the second day and the fourth day in any order. Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is K.

Response 7:
Thought:
  According to the conditions, we know that:
  - O must be on the third day, so the first and second days must be K and L.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, so G and H must be on duty on the first and second days.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so J must be on duty on the third day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G must be on duty on the fourth day with H.
  Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  According to the conditions, we know that:
  - O must be on the third day, so the first two days must be one of G, H, J, K, L, and M.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the third day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, not the third day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the third day, and J must be on the fourth day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the third day, and J must be on the fourth day, so O must be on the third day.
  Therefore, the person on duty for two days must be on the first and second days, and the person on duty for the first two days cannot be G, H, J, or K. So L and M must be on duty for the first two days. 
  Therefore, the person who must be ranked the next day is K.
Action: Answer("C")

  According to the conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - O must be on the third day, so the first and second days must be filled by other people.
  - K must be arranged at least one day on the first or second day, so K cannot be on the third day.
  - The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, so the person on duty for two days cannot be on the first, second, or third day.
  - J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the fourth day.
  - G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the fourth day.
  Therefore, L must be on the fourth day. 
  The next day after L is the first day, so the person on duty for the first day cannot be K. 
  J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the first day. 
  G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the first day. 
  Therefore, K must be on the first day, and the person on duty for the first day is not K. 
  The next day after the first day is the second day, and the person on duty for the second day cannot be K. 
  J should be placed on the next day of duty H, so H cannot be on the second day. 
  G must be on the same day as one of J and O, so G cannot be on the second day. 
  Therefore, J must be on the second day, and the person on duty for the second day is not K or J. 
  The next day after the second day is the third day, and O must be on the third day. 
  Therefore, the person on duty for the third day is not K, J, or O. 
  The person on duty for two days must be on the fourth day, so the person on duty for the fourth day is not K, J, or O. 
  Therefore, the person on duty for the fourth day is either G or H. 
  Since J should be placed on the next day of duty H, and H cannot be on the fourth day, G must be on the fourth day. 
  Therefore, the person on duty for the fourth day is G, and the person on duty for two days is H.

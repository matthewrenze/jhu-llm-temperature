### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  The only remaining answer choice is E.
  We don't have any information about whether O'Neill reviews Sunset or not, so it is possible that O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company will still own three buildings.
  Therefore, the only way to make a trade is to trade one building for one other building of the same class.
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 or two class 3 buildings.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings, so they cannot be traded for one class 1 or one class 2 building.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco.
  After the trade, RealProp will own the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco will own the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp will own the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The only answer choice that matches this configuration is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To determine which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made, we need to consider the possible trades that can be made.
  The Garza Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Lynch Building is a class 2 building, so it can be traded for one building of the same class or two class 3 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all class 2 buildings, so they can be traded for one building of the same class or two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trades are:
    1. Garza Tower for King Building and Ortiz Building
    2. Flores Tower for King Building and Meyer Building
    3. Lynch Building for Yates House and Zimmer House
  From the above trades, we can see that the only possible option is E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.
  Let's consider each option:
    - Option A: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. This is not possible because Southco only owns one class 1 building.
    - Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Meyer Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions of the three kinds of trades.
    - Option C: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. This is not possible because the Yates House is not a class 1 building.
    - Option D: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. This is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for another class 1 building.
    - Option E: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Zimmer House (class 3) and the Yates House (class 3) owned by RealProp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions of the three kinds of trades.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To determine which answer choice is correct, we need to find a trade that satisfies the conditions of the problem.
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings. Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building. The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings. Therefore, Southco must trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. There is no way to make a trade that satisfies the conditions of the problem.
  Therefore, the only possible answer choice is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company must still own three buildings.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings, so they cannot be traded for a class 2 or class 1 building.
  The Flores Tower is a class 1 building, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is RealProp trading the Garza Tower (class 1) for two Trustcorp class 2 buildings.
  This means Trustcorp must give up two of its class 2 buildings, and the only combination that works is the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  So, after the trade, the buildings owned by the three companies are:
    RealProp: the Yates House, the Zimmer House, and the King Building
    Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building
    Trustcorp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.
  Let's consider each option:
    - Option A: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. This is not possible because Southco only owns one class 1 building.
    - Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp. Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Meyer Building (class 2) owned by Trustcorp. This is possible because each trade satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the answer is B.
    - Option C: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Lynch Building (class 2) owned by Southco. This is not possible because the buildings are not of the same class.
    - Option D: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Zimmer House (class 3) owned by Trustcorp. This is not possible because the Yates House is a class 3 building and cannot be traded for class 2 buildings.
    - Option E: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) owned by Southco. Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) owned by RealProp. This is not possible because the Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings and cannot be traded for class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, each company must still own three buildings.
  Therefore, one of the class 3 buildings must have been traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building must have been traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The only possible trade is RealProp trading the Garza Tower (class 1) for two Trustcorp class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, after the trade, RealProp owns the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the King Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).

    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, the number of buildings owned by each company must remain the same.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower is the only class 1 building, and the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are the only class 2 buildings.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are the only class 3 buildings.
  RealProp can trade the Flores Tower for the King Building and the Meyer Building, or for the Ortiz Building and the King Building.
  Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
    RealProp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House or the Ortiz Building, the King Building, and the Zimmer House
    Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building
    Trustcorp: the Garza Tower and the other two buildings not traded by RealProp.

  Therefore, RealProp will own the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) and two Trustcorp class 2 buildings.
  Southco will own the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp will own the King Building, the Meyer Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Garza Tower (class 1) from RealProp.

  Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings (King Building, Meyer Building, or Ortiz Building) for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco can trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings.
  After these trades, the buildings owned by the three companies could be:

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4, which satisfies all the constraints.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier, which satisfies the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and R must be mentioned in chapter 5, which satisfies all the constraints.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, and it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, and it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 5. However, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, which contradicts the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and S must be mentioned in chapter 6. However, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6, which contradicts the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4. However, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, which contradicts the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.

Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6, which satisfies the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, B is a possible answer.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, which satisfies the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, C is a possible answer.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 7, which satisfies the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, D is a possible answer.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3, which satisfies the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, E is a possible answer.

  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, or 5. 
  R and S can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.

Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.

Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third, fourth, or fifth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Waite's or Kammer's.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be second or third.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
- From the above conditions, we can deduce that the order must be Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
- Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third, fourth, or fifth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Waite's audition must be the first audition, Kammer's audition must be the second audition, Trillo's audition must be the fifth audition, and Yoshida's audition must be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the possible order of the auditions, from first to last, is: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida.
  The answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Trillo's or Zinn's audition.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
- Combining the above conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices:
  - A: Trillo's audition must be fourth or later, so this order is not possible.
  - C: Kammer's audition must be first or second, so this order is not possible.
  - D: Kammer's audition must be first or second, so this order is not possible.
- We are left with answer choices B and E.
- In answer choice B, Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Then Kammer's audition is second, which satisfies the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. The remaining auditions can be arranged in any order that satisfies the remaining conditions.
- In answer choice E, Zinn's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. However, this order does not satisfy the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
- Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either the third or the sixth audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either the third or the sixth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or the second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or the second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first or the second audition.
  Therefore, the first two auditions must be some combination of Waite, Kammer, and Zinn.
  If the third audition is the unrecorded one, then the fourth audition must be the recorded one, and vice versa.
  If the third audition is the recorded one, then the fifth audition must be the unrecorded one, and vice versa.
  Therefore, the possible orders are:
  - Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida (if the third audition is recorded and the sixth audition is unrecorded)
  - Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida, Trillo (if the third audition is unrecorded and the sixth audition is recorded)
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.

  Therefore, the possible orders of the auditions are:
  1. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
  2. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida, Trillo
  3. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
  Option A does not satisfy the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Option B does not satisfy the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Option C satisfies all the conditions.
  Option D does not satisfy the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.

  Therefore, the answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Kammer or Lugo.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition must be either Kammer or Lugo.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must be first or second.
  Therefore, the possible orders are:
  1. Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  2. Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida, Zinn
  3. Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Zinn, Yoshida
  4. Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida, Zinn

  The only option that matches one of the possible orders is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third, fourth, or fifth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.

  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio can be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the following could be true:
  Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
  Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  Ryan is assigned to 1924.
  Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  Mollie is not assigned to the project.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:

  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio can be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then the following could be true:
  Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 and Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
  Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, but Onyx is already assigned to 1922, so Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922 because Onyx is already assigned to 1922 and only one student can be assigned to each year.
  Therefore, Yoshio must be assigned to 1924.
  The only option that could be true is B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.

  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one of them gives which lecture.
  If oil paintings is the first lecture, then watercolors must be the third lecture, and lithographs must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the sculptures lecture, and Garcia must give the oil paintings lecture. This means that choice B is true.
  If sculptures is the second lecture, then oil paintings must be the first lecture, and lithographs must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Farley must give the watercolors lecture, and Jiang must give the sculptures lecture. This means that choice E is true.
  Therefore, either choice B or choice E could be true.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be second.
  Garcia and Jiang's lectures must be third and fourth, but we don't know which order.
  Let's check each choice:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. This is not possible because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is either first or second.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is possible because the oil paintings lecture must be first or second, and Garcia's lecture is either third or fourth.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This is not possible because Garcia's lecture must be either third or fourth, and the sculptures lecture is not one of the topics that Garcia can give a lecture on.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This is not possible because Holden's lecture must be second, and the sculptures lecture is either third or fourth.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. This is possible because Jiang's lecture is either third or fourth, and the lithographs lecture is either third or fourth.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")

  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be first or second.
  If Holden's lecture is first, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be second and third, but this would mean that the oil paintings lecture is last, which contradicts the constraint that the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be second.
  If Holden's lecture is second, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be third and fourth, but this would mean that the oil paintings lecture is last, which contradicts the constraint that the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be the sculptures lecture.
  If Farley's lecture is not the watercolors lecture, then it must be the sculptures lecture, but this would mean that the oil paintings lecture is last, which contradicts the constraint that the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the watercolors lecture.
  If Farley's lecture is the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be the sculptures lecture, and Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture, in some order.
  Therefore, Garcia could give the oil paintings lecture, which is choice B.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected and if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting both F and L.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be either K, L, or M because there is no restriction on selecting only one chemist.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then it cannot be K and M together because K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, it must be either K and L or L and M. In either case, F can still be selected because there is no restriction on selecting both F and L or both F and M.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F and G can both be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then either K and L or K and M are selected.
  If K and M cannot both be selected, then K and L must be selected.
  If K is selected, then G cannot be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then F and L must be selected.
  From the above, we can conclude that if exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected as well.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.

Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, who is in the same sales zone as Udall.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there are 4 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Kim, Mahr, Parra/Tiao, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao/Udall are the sales representatives.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 2 and Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 3 and Kim and Mahr work in Zone 2.
  In both cases, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn must be in Zone 1 as well.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must be in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot be in Zone 2 because if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall must be in Zone 3, which means that there are more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information.
  If Tiao is not in Zone 2, then Tiao must be in Zone 1, and Udall must be in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao will work in the same sales zone as Quinn, which is allowed.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall will work in the same sales zone as Quinn, which is allowed.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey, who is already paired with Udall.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Parra works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 1.
  In either case, Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall.
  Therefore, Stuckey cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1, which means that Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which is not possible since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2, which means that Udall works in Zone 3 and Parra works in Zone 1. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 3, which is possible since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Parra also works in Zone 3, which means that Udall works in Zone 2 and Tiao works in Zone 1. This would leave Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey to work in Zone 1, which is not possible since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Parra or vice versa.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  We can use the above information to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2, and Parra works in Zone 3.
  In either case, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2 and Parra works in Zone 1.
  Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work in Zone 3.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is as follows:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is either A: first, B: second, or E: seventh.
  However, since it is stated that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, and Peters was recruited fourth, it is impossible for Stanton to be recruited first or second.
  Therefore, the answer is E: seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the order of the accomplices is:
  [Tao, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White] or [White, ?, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Quinn, Tao]
  In both cases, Stanton could have been recruited third, fifth, or seventh.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the order of the accomplices is:
  [Tao, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton]
  Stanton cannot have been recruited first or second because he was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Therefore, the answer is B: second.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Stanton are 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be in position 3 or 4.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Quinn are 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
  If Quinn was recruited in position 3, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, Quinn, ?, Peters, Villas, White]
  Rovero cannot be in position 4 because Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Rovero are 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7.
  If Rovero was recruited in position 5, then the order of recruitment is:
  [Stanton, ?, Quinn, ?, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton can be recruited in position 2 or 7.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited in position 2 or 7.
  The possible positions for Stanton are 1, 5, and 6.
  Therefore, the answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Stanton are 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th.
  Stanton could have been recruited third or fourth, so the answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  Therefore, the remaining two accomplices are Stanton and Tao, and they were recruited in some order after Quinn and before Peters.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before Tao, then the order of recruitment is: [?, Stanton, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  If Stanton was recruited immediately after Tao, then the order of recruitment is: [?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Tao, Stanton].
  In either case, Stanton was recruited either immediately before or immediately after Tao, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:

  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the order of the accomplices is:
  [Tao, ?, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White] or [White, ?, Villas, Rovero, Peters, Quinn, Tao]
  In both cases, Stanton could have been recruited first, second, fifth, or seventh.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao would have to be recruited second, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao would have to be recruited first, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Tao would have to be recruited sixth, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is C: third.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's oil can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 either.
  Therefore, the only option left is Greene's oil, which could be displayed on wall 2.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then I and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M does not provide any additional information.
  The conditions that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and O is placed on a higher shelf than L do not provide any information about the placement of G.
  Therefore, none of the choices can be determined from the given information.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the top shelf and H must be on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If G is on the bottom shelf, then F must be on the middle shelf because K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  If F is on the middle shelf, then M must be on the same shelf as F, which means M is also on the middle shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then K and O must be on the bottom shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If K and O are on the bottom shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf because F is on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the middle shelf, then I must be on the top shelf because H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the top shelf and H must be on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If G is on the bottom shelf, then F must be on the middle shelf because K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  If F is on the middle shelf, then M must be on the same shelf as F, which means M is also on the middle shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then K and O must be on the bottom shelf because O is placed on a higher shelf than L and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If K and O are on the bottom shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf because F is on the same shelf as M.
  If G is on the middle shelf, then I must be on the top shelf because there are already two books on the middle shelf and at least two books on each shelf.
  Therefore, if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and K must be placed on the top shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be placed on the top shelf as well.
  Therefore, G, H, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Option A, B, D, and E do not provide any information about the placement of G, H, and L.
  Option C states that H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, which is not possible since we know that F, K, and M are placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G and H must be placed on the top shelf, which contradicts the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  If H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then H must be placed on the middle shelf and M must be placed on the top or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  If I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, then G must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, then K and O must be placed on the top or middle shelf, which contradicts the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, none of the above must be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then K must be placed on the top shelf.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, I, and L must be placed on the bottom shelf, and M and O must be placed on the top shelf.
  The only answer choice that can be determined from this information is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall works in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 are Tiao, Udall, and Stuckey.
  The answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn.
  However, we also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the sales representative who does not work in Zone 1 (i.e. Parra) must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  This means that there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  We do not know where Kim, Mahr, or Tiao work, so we cannot determine if they work in Zone 3.
  The only answer choice that includes Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall is D, but we know that Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must be the ones who are not mentioned in the conditions for Zones 1 and 2.
  From the list of sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, and Quinn are not mentioned in any of the conditions.
  However, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn cannot be in Zone 3.
  Similarly, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot be split up between Zones 2 and 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one of Parra or Tiao must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn must also be in Zone 3.
  If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall must be in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  If Parra is in Zone 2, then Quinn must also be in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 3 and Quinn must be in the same zone as Parra.
  We are left with Kim and Mahr to be assigned to either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, Kim and Mahr must both be in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn.
  However, we also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2, so Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 are Tiao, Udall, and Stuckey.
  The answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 3, and Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  The only option that includes Tiao and does not include Parra or Udall is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use the schedule to determine which batches are being referred to.
  For example, if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the schedule tells us that this must happen on Wednesday.
  We can then check each statement to see if it could be false based on this scenario.
  If we try all possible combinations, we find that statement (D) could be false.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  This means that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday, so statement (D) could be false.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule for the week.
  Oatmeal cookies: M, W, F
  Peanut butter cookies: T, Th, Sa
  Sugar cookies: M, W, Th
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday as well.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true.
  At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so B is true.
  Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so C is false.
  Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so D is true.
  Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so E is true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal cookies are made on Monday, then peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  If the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then oatmeal cookies are made on Monday and sugar cookies are made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the false statement is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.

  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, which means the third batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Thursday.
  This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday or Wednesday.
  Using this information, we can determine that (B) At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday could be false, as there is only one batch of cookies made on Wednesday in this scenario.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.

  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, which means the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday as well.
  This leaves us with the following schedule:
  Monday: oatmeal 1, sugar 1, peanut butter 1
  Tuesday: oatmeal 2, sugar 2, peanut butter 2
  Wednesday: oatmeal 3, sugar 3, peanut butter 3
  Thursday: oatmeal 1, sugar 3, peanut butter 2
  Friday: oatmeal 2, sugar 1, peanut butter 3
  Using this schedule, we can evaluate each statement to see which one could be false.
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False, there are three batches made on Monday)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (False, there are two batches made on Friday)
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a different day than the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
    1. oatmeal 1st batch and sugar 3rd batch
    2. peanut butter 1st batch and oatmeal 3rd batch
    3. sugar 1st batch and peanut butter 3rd batch
  For each of these combinations, we can determine which batches are made on each day.
  We can then check which statement could be false.
  After checking, we find that statement C could be false if combination 2 is true.

  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the following must be true:
    - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday.
    - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Monday.
    - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
    - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
    - Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
    - This means that on Monday, there is only one batch of cookies made, which is false for option C.
    - Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas and White are in positions 5 and 6, in some order.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White is in position 5, Rovero is in position 7, and Tao is in position 8.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn is in position 3 and Rovero is in position 7.
  Therefore, the only possible position for Stanton is position 2.
  The only possible position for Tao is position 8.
  The only possible position for Quinn is position 3.
  The only possible position for Rovero is position 7.
  The only possible position for Villas is position 4.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero in which X, Y, and Z are three of the remaining four people.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first, Stanton was recruited second, and Tao was recruited sixth.
  The answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero in which X, Y, and Z are three of the remaining four people.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited after Rovero. Therefore, Quinn must be recruited before White.
  If Quinn was recruited before White, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Rovero, and Tao or Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Rovero, and Z.
  If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Tao, and Rovero, which violates the condition that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Rovero, and Villas, which violates the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Rovero was recruited third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited either first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either first, second, sixth, or seventh.
  Therefore, the only possible order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters].
  The answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas or Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Villas, and Z.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited after Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first, and Rovero was recruited third.
  The order of recruitment is Quinn, X, Rovero, Z, Villas, White, and Tao or Quinn, X, Rovero, Z, Villas, White, and Stanton.
  Tao cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Villas was recruited sixth.
  The answer is E: Villas was recruited sixth.

  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, Villas, and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited after Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited second or sixth.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited first, third, fourth, or fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is Stanton, Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Stanton, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited fourth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Stanton, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Stanton, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao.
  Tao was recruited sixth or later, so Tao cannot be recruited third or fourth.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Tao was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Tao, and Villas.
  If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Villas, and Tao.
  If Tao was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Villas/Tao, and Tao/Villas.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment is:
  1. Quinn, Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao
  2. Peters, Quinn, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao
  3. Peters, X, Stanton, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Villas/Tao

  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero in which X, Y, and Z are three of the remaining four people.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Z, and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be X or Y.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be X, Z, or Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton must be Y, and Quinn must be X.
  The order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Stanton, White, Rovero, Villas, and Tao.

  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Tao, Z, Villas, and Stanton.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be first.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited second or later.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be second or sixth.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited first, third, fourth, or fifth.
  If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Tao, Z, Villas, and Stanton, which is not possible.

  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the given choices, we need to find the one that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  Choice A cannot be correct because it only has two books and we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Choice B cannot be correct because it has H on the bottom shelf, but we know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and H is not mentioned in relation to K or F.
  Choice C cannot be correct because it does not include any of the books that we know are placed on the middle shelf (I) or the same shelf as F (M).
  Choice D cannot be correct because it includes O on the bottom shelf, but we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Choice E could be correct because it includes M on the bottom shelf (which we know is on the same shelf as F) and H and L on the bottom shelf (which we know are not on the same shelf as F).

  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that I cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can also conclude that K, L, and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the books placed on the bottom shelf must be F, G, H, and M.
  The only answer choice that includes all of these books is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of books that could be on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M.
  The answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")

  Choice D cannot be correct because it includes O, which we know is not on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that I cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that K and O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that F and M must be placed on the same shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:

  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  From the given choices, we need to find a list of books that could be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Choice A cannot be correct because it only has two books and we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Choice B cannot be correct because it has H on the bottom shelf, but we know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Choice C cannot be correct because it does not have any of the books that we know are placed on the middle shelf (I) or the top shelf (G, L).
  Choice D cannot be correct because it has O on the bottom shelf, but we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Choice E could be correct because it has four books (G, H, L, M) and we know that at least two books are placed on each shelf. We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F could be on the middle shelf with I, and G, H, and L could be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is E: G, H, L, M. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If F and M are on the same shelf, they cannot both be on the bottom shelf.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Therefore, we need to find a condition that also prevents M and N from being published in the same season.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not affect M and N being published in the same season.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not affect M and N being published in the same season.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not affect M and N being published in the same season.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition prevents M and N from being published in the same season, just like the original condition.
  E: If O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition does not affect M and N being published in the same season.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the original condition.
  This means that the new condition should also prevent M and N from being published in the same season.
  Choice A does not have the same effect because it does not involve M and N.
  Choice B does not have the same effect because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  Choice C does not have the same effect because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  Choice D has the same effect because it involves M and N.
  Choice E does not have the same effect because it involves O and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then only two of them can give reports on the same day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that George cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.
  Therefore, Nina can give a report on Wednesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Robert and Olivia cannot give reports on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Robert and Olivia must give reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday.
  Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday and Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Robert must give a report on Monday.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the remaining three students who give reports must be Helen, Irving, and Kyle or Lenore.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then George and Robert must give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Nina gives a report on Wednesday and George and Robert give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. This means that Helen must give a report on Wednesday.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. This means that Wells cannot be selected since Ruiz and Verma cannot be selected if Wells is selected. However, we still have Xue as an option, so the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected. This means that Taylor cannot be selected, so Wells cannot be selected. This leaves us with only Ruiz, Verma, and Xue as options for the project members. However, we still need to select the project leader, so the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we are left with Smith, Taylor, Wells, Ruiz, and Verma as options for the project members. However, we still need to select the project leader, so the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we are left with Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue as options for the project members. Since Quinn and Ruiz can only be project members if leading the project, and neither Ruiz nor Wells can be selected, this means that Quinn must be the project leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  The answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  Exactly three workers will be selected and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine if the project leader is selected or not. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we can determine that Verma will be selected. So, this option can completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we cannot determine if Quinn will be selected or not. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection for the project.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there cannot be a project leader.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  The answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some possibilities.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. Therefore, option A is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. Therefore, option B is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we can still have any of the other five workers as project members. Therefore, option C is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be selected, and we can have either Smith or Taylor as the third member. Therefore, option D is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected as a project member and leader, and we can have either Smith or Taylor as the third member. Therefore, option E is correct.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  Exactly three workers will be selected and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This means that Wells cannot be a project member because if Wells is selected, then Taylor must also be selected. Therefore, Quinn and Ruiz must be selected and one of them must be the project leader. This completely determines the selection for the project.
  The answer is A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some possibilities.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, B is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine whether the constraints are violated or not. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be a project member and the project leader, and Smith and Taylor must be the other project members. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, E is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected, and the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. This means that the third project member must be either Verma, Wells, or Xue. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected, and the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells. This means that the third project member must be either Verma or Xue. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells. This means that the third project member must be either Smith or Taylor. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn, and the third project member must be either Smith or Taylor. Therefore, this option completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn, and the third project member must be either Smith, Taylor, or Wells. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.

  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must occupy spaces 1 and 7, respectively. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant at space 7 must be separated from the other restaurant by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must occupy space 2 or 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot occupy space 3 or 5. Therefore, the toy store must occupy space 3 or 5. The remaining businesses can occupy the remaining spaces.

The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?

  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which of the answer choices is consistent with these conditions.
  Choice A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, A is not true.
  Choice B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This violates the condition that the mirror is auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, B is not true.
  Choice C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, C is not true.
  Choice D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This is consistent with all the conditions given. Therefore, D could be true.
  Choice E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This is consistent with all the conditions given. Therefore, E could be true.

  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th or later, then the mirror cannot be auctioned before the lamp, which violates the condition that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, option A is not possible.
  
Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  The vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
  Therefore, option B is possible.
  
Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  The lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or later, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
  Therefore, option C is not possible.
  
Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later, which violates the condition that the vase is auctioned after the sundial.
  Therefore, option D is not possible.
  
Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, which violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later, which violates the condition that the vase is auctioned after the sundial.
  Therefore, option E is not possible.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on these conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, option B is possible.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the table must be auctioned on June 4th or earlier. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, option E is possible.
  Therefore, options B and E are possible.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 4:
Thought:

  We also know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on these conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, option B is possible.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the table must be auctioned on June 4th or earlier. This satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, option E is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or E.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd or later, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - Choice A: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on that day.
  - Choice C: The vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on that day.
  - Choice E: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  This leaves us with two possible choices:
  - Choice B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. In this case, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 3rd. The table must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  - Choice D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. In this case, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. The table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  Therefore, both choices B and D could be true.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which of the options is possible based on the given conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned before the vase. This is possible, so option B could be true.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd, and the table must be auctioned before the vase. This is possible, so option D could be true.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the table must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Based on the above analysis, options B and D could be true.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. 
Action: Answer("D")

  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check each answer choice to see if it is possible.
  
  A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means that the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 4th, and June 5th, but we still need an antique to be auctioned on June 6th. This is not possible because all antiques have already been auctioned. Therefore, A is not possible.
  
  B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th, but we still need an antique to be auctioned on June 6th. This is not possible because all antiques have already been auctioned. Therefore, B is not possible.
  
  C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means that the table, sundial, and mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 4th, and June 5th. The only antique left is the harmonica, which can be auctioned on June 6th. Therefore, C is possible.
  
  D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This means that the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th. The only antiques left are the mirror and the lamp, which can be auctioned on any of the remaining days. Therefore, D is possible.
  
  E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th. This means that the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 4th. The only antique left is the harmonica, which can be auctioned on June 3rd. Therefore, E is possible.
  
  Both C and D are possible, but only one answer choice can be selected.

  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on the given conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But, the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option A is not possible.

  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st. This satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, option D is possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the table must be auctioned on June 4th or later.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:

  We need to determine which statement is impossible, regardless of how many trades are made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.

  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is impossible because RealProp does not own the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This is possible if Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and trades the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is impossible because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This is possible if Trustcorp trades the King Building and the Ortiz Building for the Garza Tower and trades the Flores Tower for the Lynch Building.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.

  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, White or
  2. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Villas, Rovero, White
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order of recruitment must be the second option. Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, then Villas was recruited immediately before White, and Rovero was recruited fifth.
  The answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.

  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could be recruited either first or third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White could be recruited either sixth or seventh.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton could be recruited either first, third, fifth, or seventh.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [Peters] [5] [Villas] [White]
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [Peters] [Rovero] [Villas] [White]

  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be recruited either fourth or fifth.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must be recruited fourth, which is not possible because Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Villas must be recruited fifth and White must be recruited seventh, which is not possible because there are only seven people.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be first. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, which means R must be seventh. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be fourth and G must be first.
  The only answer choice that matches this conclusion is B: J is third.

Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis, Onyx, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922, 1924, and 1923, respectively.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, and Ryan must be assigned to 1921, 1924, and 1923, respectively.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1921, 1924, 1923, and 1922, respectively.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1922, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1922.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies the condition that Mollie must be assigned to 1922 is B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other one works in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, and Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2, leaving only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3. This means that neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 3, so C and E are not true.
  If there are 5 sales representatives in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and the other one works in Zone 3. This means that either C or D could be true.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall both work in Zone 3, which means that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 1, so A is not true.
  If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall both work in Zone 1, which means that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, so B is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1, and there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2, and there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1, and there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1, and there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 1.
  From the given choices, the only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be either 1 or 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 2 as well. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3. This leaves only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 1. Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1 and Parra must work in Zone 3.
  The only answer choice that is consistent with this is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are exactly 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, then neither Stuckey nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  Since there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, and Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there is at most one other sales representative in Zone 1.
  Therefore, either Stuckey or Udall works in Zone 1, and the other works in Zone 2.
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 2.
  Since there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, and either Stuckey or Udall works in Zone 1, then the other works in Zone 2.
  Since Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 3, and Mahr works in Zone 1.
  The only choice that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 and either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3, 4, 5, or 6 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that Quinn also works in Zone 3, which leaves only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 1. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 3. This means that Udall also works in Zone 3, which leaves only Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 2. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 3.
  The only choice that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then there are 2 sales representatives in that zone.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, then there are 2 sales representatives in that zone.
  Therefore, there are at least 5 sales representatives in Zone 3 and Zone 1 combined.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1 and Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 and Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra could work in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")

  Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be either 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and 1 sales representative working in Zone 1 or 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and no sales representative working in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because that would mean there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 1. Similarly, Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because that would mean there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Udall works in Zone 3 and there are 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and 1 sales representative working in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra must also work in Zone 1 and Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that there are exactly 7 sales representatives. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, which means there are only 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn and Parra work in Zone 1 and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  This means there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, and the only option that could be true is that Mahr works in Zone 2.
  The answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are either 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are either both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are either both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, then Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively.
  If there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 2, then Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, and the remaining sales representatives must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to determine which three students will give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and Nina cannot give a morning report on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday, so Nina can give a morning report on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:

  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find a combination of three students for each day, where each student gives a morning report.
  We can start by eliminating the choices that include Kyle or Lenore.
  Choice A includes Nina, who cannot give a report on Monday.
  Choice B includes Kyle.
  Choice C includes Lenore.
  Choice D includes Lenore.
  Choice E includes Kyle.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  From the given choices, A, B, C, D, and E, we need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they include Olivia or Robert who cannot give an afternoon report.
  Choice A includes George who can only give a report on Tuesday, so we can eliminate it.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who could give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to consider the different possibilities for which students could give morning reports on each day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. However, George must also give a report on Tuesday, so he would have to give an afternoon report, which is not allowed. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. However, if Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving could give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively. The remaining morning report on Monday could be given by any of the other three students: George, Olivia, or Robert. The remaining morning report on Tuesday could be given by any of the other two students: George or Olivia. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by George, Helen, and Irving.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.

  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  From the given choices, A, B, C, D, and E, we need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  We can eliminate choices C and D because they include Olivia and Robert, who cannot give morning reports.
  We can eliminate choice E because it includes George, who can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Choice A includes George, who can only give a report on Tuesday, so we can eliminate it.
  Choice B includes Irving and Helen, who must give reports on consecutive days if Nina gives a report, but we don't know if Nina will give a report or not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to find three people who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six people left.
  We can try to use the conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. This means that they must give morning reports. Therefore, Robert and Olivia can give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  This leaves us with four people: George, Helen, Irving, and Nina.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this is not possible.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Monday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Nina, Helen, and George.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.

  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. So, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday; otherwise, Helen and Irving will have to give reports on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot be part of the answer for Monday and Wednesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they can only give morning reports.
  From the remaining students, we can choose three who can give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  The only choice that satisfies all the given conditions is E: Robert, George, and Helen.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  Therefore, we need to choose three students from the remaining six students.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
     If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Kyle and Lenore are not available to give reports, so this option is not possible.
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
     This option is possible because none of the conditions are violated.
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
     If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so this option is not possible.
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
     This option is possible because none of the conditions are violated.
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
     If George gives a report on Tuesday, then on Wednesday, Helen and Irving must both give reports. But Kyle and Lenore are not available to give reports, so this option is not possible.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving, Robert, and Helen. The answer is B. Answer("B")

Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined which shelf each book is placed on.
  If any of the given statements contradicts this arrangement, then it cannot be fully determined which shelf each book is placed on.
  The only statement that does not contradict this arrangement is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  Therefore, if L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  The answer is C. Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, we can place M on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the same shelf as L.
  If we place F and M on the top shelf, then there are only two books left for the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  If we place K on the top shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that at least two books are on each shelf.
  Therefore, K must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If K is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, K must be on the bottom shelf.
  If K is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, then M must be placed on the same shelf. If we place F on the middle shelf, then M must be placed on the top or bottom shelf. 
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the middle shelf, then K must be on the bottom shelf. If F is on the bottom shelf, then K can be on either the middle or top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is on the top or middle shelf, then O must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the bottom shelf, then O can be on either the top or middle shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can't have only one book on the bottom shelf.
  Let's try to place the books based on each of the choices:
    A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf. We can then place F on the top or bottom shelf, and K on the opposite shelf. We can place O on the remaining shelf, and then place L and G on the same shelf as each other. This satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is A.
    B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top or middle shelf. We can then place F and M on the opposite shelf, and place I on the remaining shelf. We can place O on the bottom shelf, and then place L and H on the same shelf as each other. This does not satisfy the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the answer is not B.
    C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top or middle shelf. We can then place M on the opposite shelf, and place I on the remaining shelf. We can place K on the bottom shelf, and then place O and G on the same shelf as each other. This does not satisfy the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so the answer is not C.
    D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top or middle shelf. We can then place F on the opposite shelf, and place I on the remaining shelf. We can place K on the bottom shelf, and then place O and G on the same shelf as each other. This does not satisfy the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so the answer is not D.
    E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top or middle shelf. We can then place F and M on the opposite shelf, and place I on the remaining shelf. We can place K on the bottom shelf, and then place L and G on the same shelf as each other. This does not satisfy the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so the answer is not E.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf and F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined the placement of all the books based on the given conditions.
  The answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the top or bottom shelf, then M must be placed on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top or middle shelf, and F must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top or middle shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can place 3 books on the bottom shelf, 3 books on the middle shelf, and 2 books on the top shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with K, and the remaining 5 books on the bottom shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with L and the remaining 5 books on the bottom shelf.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the middle shelf with I and the remaining 5 books on the bottom shelf.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with K and the remaining 5 books on the bottom shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we can place them on the top shelf with K and the remaining 5 books on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine the placement of all the books.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we can't determine the placement of all the books.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we can't determine the placement of all the books.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we can't determine the placement of all the books.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we can't determine the placement of all the books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined the placement of all the books based on the given conditions.
  The answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.

  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We can see that the placement of the books is fully determined if we know which two books are placed on the same shelf as each other on the middle shelf.
  The only option that provides this information is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know which shelf F is on.
  If we know that K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf F is on.
  If we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf O is on.
  If we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf K is on.

Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that S must be earlier than Y.
  We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  We know that three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  We can use the given options to determine which one will help us determine the order of the articles.
  If H is fourth, we don't know where the other articles are placed.
  If H is sixth, we don't know where the other articles are placed.
  If R is fourth, we don't know where the other articles are placed.
  If R is seventh, we know that Y is fifth, and S is first, followed by Q, G, J, R, H.
  If Y is fifth, we know that S is first, followed by Q, R, G, J, Y.
  Therefore, the answer is D: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. However, we don't know which order they are in, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be G, J, and R. However, we don't know which order they are in, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be S, Q, and either G or J. Since G must be earlier than R, the order must be S, Q, J, G, R, and then either H or Y. However, we don't know the order of H and Y, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be S, Q, and either G or J. Since G must be earlier than R, the order must be S, Q, J, G, and then either H or Y. However, we don't know the order of H and Y, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be S, Q, J, and G. Since G must be earlier than R, the order must be S, Q, J, G, R, and then either H or Y. However, we don't know the order of H and Y, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices fully determine the order.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the order of the rest.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know the position of any of the other articles. We cannot determine the order.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first. We also know that S must be earlier than Q, and S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, the order is S, Q, Y, G, J, H, R.
  C: If R is fourth, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first. We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order is J, G, R, S, Q, Y, H.
  D: If R is seventh, we don't know the position of any of the other articles. We cannot determine the order.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be earlier than Y. However, we don't know the position of any of the other articles. We cannot determine the order.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
  If H is fourth, then the order could be G, R, J, H, Q, S, Y or J, G, R, H, Q, S, Y.
  If H is sixth, then the order could be Q, S, Y, G, R, J, H.
  If R is fourth, then the order could be S, Q, G, J, R, H, Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order could be S, Q, G, J, H, R, Y.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. But then the next three articles must be G, H, and J, which all cover finance. This violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, H cannot be fourth.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. Then the fourth article must be Y, since S must be earlier than Y. But then the fifth article must be G, and the sixth article must be J, which violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, H cannot be sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. Then the fourth article must be G, since J must be earlier than G. Then the fifth article must be H, and the sixth article must be J. The last article must be R. This order satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, if R is fourth, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. Then the fourth article must be G, since J must be earlier than G. Then the fifth article must be R, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, R cannot be seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J. But then the fifth article must be H, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, Y cannot be fifth.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. But then the next three articles must be G, H, and J, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the fourth and fifth articles must be G and J in some order. But then the last article must be Y, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. If G is fourth, then the last three articles must be H, R, and Y in some order, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If J is fourth, then the last three articles must be G, R, and Y in some order, which satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, C could be true.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. If G is fifth, then the fourth article must be H, and the sixth article must be R, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If J is fifth, then the fourth article must be either G or H, and the sixth article must be R. But then the last article must be Y, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J in some order. But then the fifth article must be either H or R, and the last article must be Y, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. But then the next three articles must be G, H, and J, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, this choice is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. Then, the fourth article must be G, and the fifth article must be J. But then the sixth article must be H, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, this choice is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y. Then, the fourth article must be G, the fifth article must be J, the sixth article must be H, and the seventh article must be R. This satisfies all the conditions, so the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then the sixth article must be G, and the fifth article must be J. But then the fourth article must be one of the finance articles, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, this choice is not fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and J. But then the fifth article must be one of the finance articles, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, this choice is not fully determined.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that S must be earlier than Y, so we can place S first.
  We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so we can place J, G, and R in that order.
  We know that Q must be third if S is earlier than Q, so we can place Q third.
  We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so we can place H after R and before Y.
  This leaves us with one article, which is article Y.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.
  The answer is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, which cover nutrition. But then the fourth article, H, would also cover nutrition, which violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, which cover nutrition. The fourth article cannot be H, so it must be J, which covers finance. The fifth article cannot be G, which also covers finance, so it must be Y, which covers wildlife. The sixth article would then be H, which covers finance. The seventh article cannot be R, which also covers nutrition, so it must be G, which covers finance. Therefore, B is true.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and H. The fourth article cannot be R, so it must be J, which covers finance. The fifth article cannot be G, which also covers finance, so it must be Y, which covers wildlife. The sixth article cannot be R, which covers nutrition, so it must be G, which covers finance. The seventh article must be R, which covers nutrition. Therefore, C is not true.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and H, which cover nutrition and finance. The fourth article cannot be J, which also covers finance, so it must be Y, which covers wildlife. The fifth article cannot be G, which also covers finance, so it must be R, which covers nutrition. The sixth article must be G, which covers finance. Therefore, D is not true.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, R, S, and J, which cover nutrition and finance. The fifth article must be Y, which covers wildlife. The sixth article cannot be G, which also covers finance, so it must be H, which covers finance. The seventh article must be R, which covers nutrition. Therefore, E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth. 

Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that S must be earlier than Y.
  We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  We know that three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, we don't know the order of the other articles.
  If H is sixth, we don't know the order of the other articles.
  If R is fourth, we don't know the order of the other articles.
  If Y is fifth, we don't know the order of the other articles.
  If R is seventh, we can determine the order of the other articles.
  If R is seventh, then we know that J must be first, followed by G, then S, then Q, then H, then R, and finally Y.
  Therefore, the answer is D: R is seventh.

  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf as well.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least four books on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the middle shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I, O.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so at least three books must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be placed on the same shelf, which cannot be the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If F and M are placed on the middle shelf, then the middle shelf would have at least three books (F, G, and M), which violates the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the middle shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is H, I, and O.
  The answer is C: H, I, L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:

  I is placed on the middle shelf, so I is not on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K is not on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L is not on the top shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M are either both on the top shelf or both on the middle shelf.
  If G is on the top shelf, then there are at most two books on the top shelf, so F and M cannot both be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M are both on the middle shelf.
  The only book that must be on the middle shelf is I.
  If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf, which means there are at least three books on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf.
  Therefore, L is not on the middle shelf.
  If K is on the middle shelf, then H and L must be on the bottom shelf, which means there are at least four books on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, K is not on the middle shelf.
  If H is on the middle shelf, then L must be on the bottom shelf, which means there are at least three books on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is H, I.
  The answer is A: H, I.

  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must also be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the top shelf must have two books.
  Therefore, the top shelf must have G and one other book.
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the top shelf.
  Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the only book that can be on the top shelf with G is H.

  I is placed on the middle shelf, so I is not on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K is not on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L is not on the top shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M are either both on the top shelf or both on the middle shelf or both on the bottom shelf.
  If G is on the top shelf, then there are at most two books on the top shelf, so F and M cannot both be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M are both on the middle shelf or both on the bottom shelf.
  If F and M are both on the middle shelf, then the middle shelf has at least three books (F, M, and I), which contradicts the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf.
  Therefore, F and M are both on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and F and M are both on the bottom shelf, then L is on the bottom shelf and O is on the middle or top shelf.
  If O is on the top shelf, then there are at most two books on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the middle shelf, which contradicts the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, O is on the middle shelf and K is on the top shelf.
  H cannot be on the top shelf because there are already three books on the top shelf (G, K, and one of F or M).

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica would have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which would mean that the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This would contradict the fact that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the sundial would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the sundial would have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, which would contradict the fact that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica would have to be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, which would mean that the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This would contradict the fact that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial and the lamp.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the vase must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  The only option that satisfies all the conditions is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase or E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase.
  We also know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the mirror and the vase are auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica, the mirror, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, and June 4th, but we don't know the order.
  The sundial must be auctioned on June 5th, and the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd or later, which satisfies the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase, and the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  Therefore, the only possible true statement is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  The answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the mirror and the vase are auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, but the table is auctioned on a later date.
  This means that the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, the sundial on June 3rd, and the lamp on June 4th or later.
  Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, which means that it is possible for the table to be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  The only option that could be true is C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find a statement that must be true based on the given rules.
  If we look at the rules, we can see that:
  - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  - In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  - In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  - Exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  From these rules, we can deduce that:
  - There must be at least one rug in which peach is used because it is used in any rug in which olive is used.
  - There must be at least one rug in which turquoise is used because it is not used with forest or peach, and there are only six colors available.
  - There must be at least one rug in which yellow is used because it is not used with peach, and there are only six colors available.
  - There could be multicolored rugs in which forest or turquoise is used, but we cannot say for sure that there must be or must not be.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used alone in a rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used. Therefore, olive cannot be used alone in a rug.
  From the given rules, we can conclude that:
    - There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
    - There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
    - Peach is used in one of the rugs.
    - Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used, which means that the rug is multicolored.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  The answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in a rug.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in a rug.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in a rug.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used alone in a rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used. Therefore, olive cannot be used alone in a rug.
  Based on the above rules, we can determine that:
    - A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug.
    - B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
    - C is true because peach is used in a rug where olive is used.
    - D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
    - E is not necessarily true because yellow can be used alone in a rug.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  Rule 1: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  Rule 2: In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Rule 3: Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Rule 4: Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Rule 5: Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Statement A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
    We cannot determine this from the given rules.
  Statement B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
    This statement is true based on Rule 4.
  Statement C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
    This statement is true based on Rule 2.
  Statement D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
    This statement cannot be determined from the given rules.
  Statement E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
    This statement cannot be determined from the given rules.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:

  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used, which means that the rug is multicolored.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used in that rug.
  Therefore, we can conclude that:
    - A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug.
    - B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
    - C is true because peach is used in a rug that contains olive.
    - D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
    - E is not necessarily true because yellow can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they cannot be used in the same multicolored rug.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they cannot be used in the same multicolored rug.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they cannot be used in the same multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used in that rug.
  We can eliminate options A and B because we cannot determine whether there are multicolored rugs with forest or turquoise based on the given rules.
  We can eliminate option D because we cannot determine whether turquoise is used in any of the rugs based on the given rules.
  We can eliminate option E because we cannot determine whether yellow is used in any of the rugs based on the given rules.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that Peach is used in one of the rugs. 
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.

    - A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug.
    - B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
    - C is true because peach is used in a rug where olive is used.
    - D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.

Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  From the given constraints, we can deduce that the order of the lectures must be: Farley, Holden, Garcia, Jiang.
  Farley must give the first lecture, which cannot be the lithographs lecture.
  Holden must give the second lecture, which cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Garcia must give the third lecture, which cannot be the sculptures lecture.
  Jiang must give the last lecture, which cannot be the watercolors lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  From the constraints, we know that the order of the lectures must be: 
  1. Farley's lecture
  2. Holden's lecture
  3. Garcia's lecture or Jiang's lecture
  4. Garcia's lecture or Jiang's lecture
  The order of the topics must be: oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, and sculptures.
  A cannot be true because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  B can be true because it is not restricted by any of the constraints.
  C can be true because Garcia's lecture can be either the third or fourth lecture.
  D can be true because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  E cannot be true because Jiang's lecture must be either the third or fourth lecture, and watercolors must be earlier than lithographs.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures, and each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.

Response 5:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that there will be only three students available for the remaining two years.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means that there will be only two students available for the remaining two years.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that there will be only one student available for the remaining year.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then either Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and either Mollie or Ryan must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. This leaves only one student available for the remaining year, which must be Onyx.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.

If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis can be assigned to any of the remaining years.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately after Tiffany's, which is 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1923, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately after Tiffany's, which is 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1923, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to the project.

  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the other year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the year immediately prior to Onyx's.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. But Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project if Yoshio is not assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1924.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis can be assigned to 1924.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  2. L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  Option A, B, C, and E do not match any of the above orders.
  Option D matches the order 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be one of the first two houses shown.
  If K is one of the first two houses shown, then L must be shown after K and before M, which means L must be shown as the fourth house.
  If L is one of the first two houses shown, then K must be shown as the third house, and M must be shown as the fifth house.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  2. 0, P, L, K, N, M, J
  3. P, 0, K, L, N, M, J
  Option A and B do not follow the rules.
  Option C has K and L in the wrong order.
  Option D has N before M, which violates the order.
  Therefore, the answer is E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M.
Action: Answer("E")

  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: [morning], [morning], K, L, M, N, J or [morning], [morning], K, L, M, P, J.
  The only answer choice that follows these rules is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  2. L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  The answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be one of the first two houses shown.
  If K is one of the first two houses shown, then L must be shown after K and before M, which means L must be shown in the afternoon.
  If L is one of the first two houses shown, then K must be shown after L and before M, which means K must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the only possible order is: 
  1. either K or L
  2. the other of K or L
  3. N
  4. 0
  5. M
  6. P
  7. J
  The only answer choice that matches this order is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  2. L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  Option A, B, C, and E do not match any of the above orders.
  Option D matches the order 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  2. L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  Option A, B, C, and E do not match any of the above orders.
  Option D matches the order 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be one of the first two houses shown.
  If K is one of the first two houses shown, then L must be shown after K and before M, which means L must be the fourth house shown.
  If L is one of the first two houses shown, then K must be shown after L and before M, which means K must be the third house shown.
  Therefore, the possible orders are:
  - K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  - L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  The first order has K before L, which satisfies the condition that K must be shown before L.
  The first order has J as the last house shown, which satisfies the condition that J must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the answer is A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house to be shown.
  Therefore, K must be the fifth, sixth, or seventh house to be shown.
  If K is the fifth house to be shown, then L must be shown in the afternoon, which violates the rule that L must be shown at some time after K is shown.
  If K is the sixth house to be shown, then L must be shown in the afternoon, which violates the rule that L must be shown at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be the seventh house to be shown.
  Since J is the last house to be shown, P must be the sixth house to be shown.
  Since L must be shown at some time before M is shown, and K and P have already been shown, L must be the third house to be shown and M must be the fourth house to be shown.
  Therefore, the order in which the realtor shows the houses is: 0, N, L, M, K, P, J.
  The answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the compositions performed must be T, R, F.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the compositions performed must be F, R, T.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If P is performed first, then S must be performed fifth or eighth, which is not possible.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first, which is not possible.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth, which is possible.
  If O is performed fifth and P is performed third, then the eighth composition performed must be L.
  If the eighth composition performed is L, then the order of the compositions performed must be O, R, F, T, P, S, H, L.
  Therefore, the answer is C: O, P, R.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  If P is performed first, then R must be performed second and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed second, then R must be performed first and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed third, then R must be performed first and T must be performed second.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then F and R must be performed second and third in some order.
  If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed sixth and seventh in some order.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the possible compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first: P, R, T
  - If P is performed second: R, P, T
  - If P is performed third: R, T, P
  We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they have O performed first or fifth.
  We can eliminate choice B because it has H performed second, which contradicts the fact that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the answer is A: F, H, P.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.

  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If P is performed first, then S cannot be performed fourth.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first and R must be performed third.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth and F must be performed first.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.

  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the first three compositions must be P, R, T.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the first three compositions must be P, F, T.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: O, P, T or E: P, R, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first, second, or third.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the eighth composition cannot be F, O, P, R, or T.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R cannot be performed eighth.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F cannot be performed eighth.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth and T must be performed immediately before F.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first and T must be performed immediately after R.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed first and T must be performed immediately after R.
  Therefore, the only possible list of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, P, T.
  The answer is D: O, P, T.

  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth, which is possible.
  If O is performed fifth and P is performed third, then the order of the compositions performed must be O, R, F, S, P, H/L, T.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first or second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed sixth or seventh.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If P is performed first, then S must be performed fifth or sixth, which is not possible.

  If P is performed third, then O must be performed fifth, and R must be performed first or second.
  If R is performed first, then T must be performed second, and F must be performed third.
  Therefore, an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, P, T.
  The answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  If P is performed first, then R must be performed second and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed second, then R must be performed first and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed third, then R must be performed first and T must be performed second.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then F and R must be performed second and third in some order.
  If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed sixth and seventh in some order.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the possible compositions that can be performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first: P, R, T
  - If P is performed second: R, P, T
  - If P is performed third: R, T, P
  - If O is performed first and P is performed first: O, F, R
  - If O is performed first and P is performed second: O, R, P
  - If O is performed first and P is performed third: O, R, T
  - If O is performed fifth and P is performed first: F, R, O
  - If O is performed fifth and P is performed second: R, F, O
  - If O is performed fifth and P is performed third: R, T, O
  Therefore, the answer is either A: F, H, P or B: H, P, L.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed first because P must be performed before S.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the eighth composition cannot be F, O, P, R, or S.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed sixth and F must be performed seventh.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed second and T must be performed third.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if F is performed second, then H must be performed first and P must be performed third.
  If F is performed seventh, then L must be performed eighth and H must be performed first.
  Therefore, the only possible list of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then the order of the compositions performed must be T, R, F.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then the order of the compositions performed must be F, R, T.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If P is performed first, then the compositions performed second and third must be S and either R or F. However, this violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If P is performed second, then the compositions performed first and third must be O and either R or F. However, this violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If P is performed third, then the compositions performed first and second must be O and either R or F. This satisfies all of the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.

  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  Therefore, the correct answer is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist cannot be at either end of the row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be located between the pharmacy and the restaurant.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the optometrist cannot be next to a restaurant.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the toy store.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements:
  1. Optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 1.
  2. Optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 7.
  In the first arrangement, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or space 7. In the second arrangement, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist is in space 2 and the shoe store is in space 1. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist is in space 6 and the shoe store is in space 7. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair are the pharmacy and a restaurant.

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies were made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

  The answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that one batch of cookie was made on Friday.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, we know that one batch of each kind of cookie was made on Friday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, we know that the first batch of each kind of cookie was made on a different day than the second and third batches of that kind of cookie.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Therefore, we know that one batch of cookie was made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, we know that the first batch of sugar cookies was made on a day other than Thursday.
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. (Not possible because we know that at least one batch of cookie was made on Monday, and we know that the first batch of each kind of cookie was made on a different day than the second and third batches of that kind of cookie.)
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. (Not possible because we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies was not made on Tuesday.)
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. (Possible because we know that one batch of each kind of cookie was made on Friday, and we know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies was not made on Friday.)
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. (Not possible because we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies was not made on Wednesday.)
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. (Not possible because we know that the first batch of peanut butter cookies was not made on Tuesday.)

  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.

  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that there are no batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  This leaves us with two batches of cookies to be made on Tuesday: the first batch of sugar cookies and the second batch of peanut butter cookies.

  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday or Friday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.

  If peach is used in a solid rug, then it must be used with olive in a multicolored rug.
  If yellow is used in a solid rug, then it must be used with white in a multicolored rug.
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then it must be used with white in a multicolored rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, or peach and yellow.
  The answer is A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of them must have exactly one color from the available six colors.
  We can eliminate the choices that contain peach or turquoise because they cannot be used in a solid rug with any other color.
  We can eliminate the choice that contains forest and peach because they cannot be used together in a rug.
  We can eliminate the choice that contains forest and yellow because they can be used together in a rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be Peach and Yellow.
  The answer is D: Peach and Yellow.

  Therefore, L must be the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  M must be shown after L, so M cannot be the fourth or fifth house.
  Therefore, M must be the sixth or seventh house.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening, so J and M must be the sixth and seventh houses.

  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  In either case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on the day that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for Wednesday: no cookies are made on Wednesday or one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday or Thursday.
  If one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on either Tuesday or Thursday and one batch of cookies made on Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, which is not possible. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  If no cookies are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on Tuesday or Thursday. However, the first batch of sugar cookies is already made on Thursday, so there cannot be two batches of cookies made on Thursday. Therefore, there must be two batches of cookies made on Tuesday.
  The answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("A")

  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then there are already three batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are no batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.

  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for Wednesday: no batches are made on Wednesday or one batch is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches made on Tuesday and one batch made on Friday.
  If one batch is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches made on Tuesday and two batches made on Friday.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person; Red team: Juana and Mei; or (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person; Red team: Juana and Mei.
  In both configurations, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Lateefah is not necessarily a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the green team.
  Mei is not necessarily a facilitator.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well, and neither Juana nor Mei can be a facilitator. This contradicts the fact that Olga is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga cannot be a facilitator, which contradicts the fact that Olga is a facilitator. Therefore, Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the green team, and Juana is assigned to the red team. Mei is the remaining member of the red team, and Kelly is the remaining member of the green team. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only remaining statement is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: Green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and Red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well. Therefore, Olga would be assigned to the green team, which contradicts the fact that Juana and Olga must be on different teams. Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the green team.
  Since Lateefah is already assigned to the green team, there is only one spot left on the green team, which must be filled by Juana. Therefore, Mei, Kelly, and Olga must be assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, and the answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be assigned to a team with either Mei or Juana.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Mei must be assigned to the green team with Lateefah and Olga.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the green team, but Mei is not a facilitator.
  Juana is not a facilitator, so neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  The only statement that must be true is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, the team with Lateefah must have three members and the other team must have two members.
  Olga is a facilitator and there is only one facilitator per team.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the team with two members and Juana is assigned to the team with three members.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly is assigned to the team with three members.
  Mei is the only person left and must be assigned to the team with two members.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Neither Lateefah nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("E")

  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well, and neither Juana nor Mei can be a facilitator.
  If Juana is assigned to the green team, then Olga must be assigned to the red team, and Juana and Mei cannot both be facilitators.
  Therefore, it must be true that Juana is assigned to the red team, and Mei is not a facilitator.
  The answer is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.

  If Juana is assigned to the green team, then Olga must be assigned to the red team, and Juana and Mei cannot both be facilitators.
  Therefore, either Juana is assigned to the green team and Olga is assigned to the red team, or Juana is assigned to the red team and Mei is assigned to the green team.
  If Juana and Mei are both facilitators, then they must be on different teams, which means Juana is on the red team and Mei is on the green team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it would violate the condition that Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings because it would violate the condition that Southco must own at least one class 1 building after some number of trades.
  Therefore, Southco must trade its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp cannot trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings because it would violate the condition that RealProp must own at least one class 1 building after some number of trades.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp must trade its class 2 building for RealProp's class 1 building.
  Southco must trade its class 2 building for RealProp's remaining class 3 building.
  Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building, a class 2 building, and a class 3 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp must trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 1 building.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Southco must trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must make a trade with Trustcorp.
  The only option that reflects this is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings with RealProp, then RealProp will own two class 3 buildings and Trustcorp will own only class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building after some number of trades.
  Southco has no class 3 buildings to trade with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco has not made any trades with Trustcorp.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade of a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, so it cannot have made a trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building from Trustcorp.
  The only remaining class 2 building is the Ortiz Building, which is owned by Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House.
  The answer is E: Trustcorp owns the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it would violate the condition that Trustcorp cannot own any class 2 buildings after some number of trades.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building, so it must be the one trading with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, but it is not necessarily true that RealProp must own a class 1 building after the trades.
  The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, but it is not necessarily true that Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower after the trades.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are owned by RealProp, but they are both class 3 buildings, so they cannot be traded for a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")

  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Southco cannot trade any class 2 building with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco must trade its class 2 building with RealProp or keep it.
  If Southco trades its class 2 building with RealProp, then RealProp will own a class 2 building.
  Therefore, RealProp cannot own a class 1 building.
  If Southco keeps its class 2 building, then Southco will own a class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco cannot only own class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, B and C are not true.
  Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, D and E are not true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only own class 3 buildings after the trade.
  The only class 3 buildings available for trade are the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will own at least one class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  The only other trade available is trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade one of its class 2 buildings for another class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for another class 2 building, then Trustcorp will still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot own any class 3 buildings after the trade.
  RealProp owns the only class 1 building.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building.
  Therefore, Southco cannot trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco can only trade one building for one other building of the same class.
  Therefore, Southco can only trade its class 2 building for another class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco will still own only one class 1 building and one class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, B is false.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, A is true.
  Southco can only trade its class 2 building for another class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, C is false.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building and the Meyer Building, which are both class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, D is false.
  Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House, which is a class 3 building.
  Therefore, E is false.
  The only true statement is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building or one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one class 1 building, then Trustcorp will own one class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one class 2 building, then Trustcorp will own only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  Southco owns only class 2 and class 1 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade a class 3 building for a class 2 building.

### Temperature: 1.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands must be Wellspring, Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Zircon performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Uneasy must perform in slot four, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, which violates the constraint that Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot three.
  If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Yardsign must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
  The only remaining option is that Zircon performs in slot two and Xpert performs in slot three.

  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the first four slots must be one of the following: 
    1. Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite/Yardsign, Vegemite/Yardsign, Uneasy
    2. Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite/Yardsign, Vegemite/Yardsign, Uneasy
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.

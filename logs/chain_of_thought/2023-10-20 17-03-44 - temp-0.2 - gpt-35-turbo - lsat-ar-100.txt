### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  The answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")

  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  The only remaining answer choice is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  The only remaining answer choice is E, which is possible because we know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, and we do not have any information that contradicts this possibility.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  The only remaining answer choice is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either of them.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the student who reviews Undulation must be one of Lopez or Megregian.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then he cannot review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, O'Neill must review Tamerlane.
  The remaining student who reviews Undulation must be Lopez.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Sunset, O'Neill does not review Sunset, Jiang does not review Sunset, and Lopez does not review Sunset.
  The remaining play that has not been reviewed is Sunset.
  Therefore, O'Neill cannot review Sunset.
  Therefore, the answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.

  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  The only remaining option is that Megregian does not review Undulation.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("A")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class is allowed.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings is allowed.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is allowed.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 3 building is to trade two class 2 buildings for one class 3 building.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House can only be traded for two class 2 buildings each.
  The Flores Tower can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  The Garza Tower can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building can only be traded for one class 1 building each.
  The only way to get a class 1 building is to trade two class 2 buildings for one class 1 building.
  Therefore, the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building cannot be traded for any of the other buildings.
  The only way to get two class 2 buildings is to trade one class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  Southco can trade the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Trustcorp can trade the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and get two class 2 buildings by trading the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and two class 2 buildings
  Southco: the Flores Tower and two class 3 buildings
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower and two class 2 buildings
  The answer is D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the companies must exchange buildings of the same class or follow the rules for trading class 1 or class 2 buildings.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building and the Ortiz Building (both class 2).
  Option C is possible if RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) for the Lynch Building (class 2) and Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1).
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Meyer Building (class 2) for the Garza Tower (class 1).
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  After only one trade is made, the number of buildings owned by each company must remain the same.
  The only possible trade that would keep the number of buildings owned by each company the same is a trade of one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The only two class 2 buildings available for trade are the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  Therefore, the Flores Tower must be traded for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  The remaining buildings must be owned by RealProp and Southco.
  The only class 1 building available for trade is the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the Garza Tower must be traded for two class 2 buildings, which are the Lynch Building and either the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House must remain with RealProp.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class is not possible.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings is not possible because there is only one class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is not possible because there are three class 2 buildings and only two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is RealProp's Garza Tower (class 1) for Southco's Flores Tower (class 1).
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The only answer that matches this configuration is E.

Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the buildings must be of the same class or follow the rules above.
  Let's analyze each option:
    - Option A: RealProp has a class 1 and a class 3 building, but Southco has no class 3 building to trade. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a trade with them. This option is not valid.
    - Option B: RealProp has a class 1 building, but it is not possible to trade it for two class 2 buildings because Trustcorp has no class 1 building to trade. This option is not valid.
    - Option C: RealProp has a class 1 building, and Southco has a class 2 building to trade for two class 3 buildings. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a trade with them. This option is valid.
    - Option D: RealProp has a class 1 building, but it is not possible to trade it for two class 2 buildings because Trustcorp has no class 1 building to trade. This option is not valid.
    - Option E: RealProp has a class 1 building, but it is not possible to trade it for two class 2 buildings because Trustcorp has no class 1 building to trade. This option is not valid.
  Therefore, the only valid option is C.

Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make a valid trade, the companies must exchange buildings of the same class or follow the rules for trading a class 1 or class 2 building.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for a class 2 building.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Option C is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, Southco trades the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp trades the King Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 3 building for a class 2 building.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made must have the same total number of buildings and the same total number of buildings in each class as before the trade.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would have two class 1 buildings after the trade.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would have two class 3 buildings after the trade.
  Option C is possible because each company would have one building of each class after the trade.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would have two class 3 buildings after the trade.
  Option E is not possible because Southco would have two class 2 buildings after the trade.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trades are:
    Garza Tower (class 1) for King Building (class 2) and Ortiz Building (class 2)
    Flores Tower (class 1) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3)
    Lynch Building (class 2) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3)
  From the above trades, we can see that Trustcorp will always end up with two class 3 buildings, and RealProp will always end up with one class 1 building.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find a combination of trades that results in each company owning a building of each class.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. They need a class 2 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building. They need a class 3 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings. They need a class 1 building and a class 3 building.
  From the given choices, the only combination that satisfies these conditions is:
    - RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building
    - Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Yates House and the Zimmer House
    - Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Garza Tower
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building

The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill

Response 1:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane because they either review fewer plays than Megregian or review plays that Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane is either Kramer and O'Neill or O'Neill and Kramer.
  The answer is either B: Kramer, O'Neill or C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 2:

  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian, and Jiang can review Tamerlane because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang can review Tamerlane since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.

  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez or Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer and O'Neill, but not Jiang.
  The list must also include at least one other student.
  The list cannot include Megregian because Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, and exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill, plus one other student.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  Jiang does not review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez.
  Therefore, Megregian cannot review all three plays.
  If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill must review the same play as each other, which would make three students who review the same play.
  This contradicts the condition that exactly two students review the same play or plays.
  Therefore, Megregian cannot review Tamerlane.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and O'Neill must review the same play as each other, which would make three students who review the same play or plays.
  This contradicts the condition that exactly two students review the same play or plays.
  Therefore, Lopez cannot review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Kramer and O'Neill are the only students who review Tamerlane.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")

  At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
  We can start by selecting three novels, which means we have to select at least one French novel and one Russian novel.
  If we select one French novel, we can select at most three more French works, which means we can select at most one more French novel and at most two French plays.
  If we select two French novels, we can select at most two more French works, which means we can select at most two French plays.
  If we select three French novels, we cannot select any more French works.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp doesn't own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Southco doesn't own the Garza Tower because it is owned by RealProp.
  Trustcorp doesn't own the Garza Tower because it is owned by RealProp.
  Trustcorp doesn't own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Therefore, A, B, and E cannot be true.

  D is possible because Southco doesn't own the Flores Tower and Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, so it cannot be owned by RealProp or Trustcorp.
  The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
  The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be owned by Southco.
  The Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, A, B, and D cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House.
  Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes according to the given rules.

  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Southco cannot own the Meyer Building and the Garza Tower at the same time because they are owned by different companies.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building at the same time because they are owned by different companies.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building at the same time because they are owned by different companies.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.

  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  Southco does not own the Garza Tower or the Yates House.
  Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Yates House.
  Therefore, A, B, C, and E are possible.
  The only option left is D.
  If Trustcorp owns the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building, then Southco must own the Lynch Building and RealProp must own the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  However, this would mean that there is no class 2 building available for Trustcorp to trade for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, D cannot be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp owns only one class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building, which is the Flores Tower.
  Trustcorp does not own any class 1 building.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings, which are the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Southco does not own any class 3 building.
  Trustcorp does not own any class 3 building.
  The only possible trade involving a class 1 building is trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  The only possible trade involving a class 2 building is trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the buildings owned by RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp cannot be the same.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the Garza Tower.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.
  E can be true because Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the Garza Tower and the Ortiz Building for the Meyer Building.
  Therefore, the answer is E.

  Therefore, C cannot be true.
  Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.
  Therefore, D cannot be true.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower and the Yates House.

- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
- Combining these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices:
  - A: Kammer's audition must be first or second, so Trillo cannot be second. Eliminate.
  - C: Kammer's audition must be first or second, so Trillo cannot be fourth. Eliminate.
  - E: Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier, so Yoshida cannot be fourth or earlier. Eliminate.
- Try to satisfy the remaining conditions with the answer choices:
  - B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
    - Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
    - Kammer's audition is second, which satisfies the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
    - Yoshida's audition is third, which satisfies the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
    - Zinn's audition is fourth, which satisfies the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
    - Lugo's audition is fifth, which satisfies the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded.
    - Trillo's audition is last, which satisfies the condition that the other four auditions will not be recorded.
  - D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
    - Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
    - Zinn's audition is second, which satisfies the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
    - Kammer's audition is third, which satisfies the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
    - Trillo's audition is fourth, which satisfies the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
    - Lugo's audition is fifth, which satisfies the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded.
    - Yoshida's audition is last, which satisfies the condition that the other four auditions will not be recorded.
- Both answer choices B and D satisfy all the conditions, but B has Waite's audition first, which is earlier than Kammer's audition, as required by one of the conditions. Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.

- Therefore, the answer is D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Trillo's or Yoshida's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be third or earlier.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  Answer choice A is impossible because Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Answer choice E is impossible because Zinn's audition must be third or earlier.
  Answer choice B is impossible because Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Answer choice C is possible because it satisfies all the conditions.
  Answer choice D is impossible because Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Therefore, the possible orders are:
  1. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
  2. Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  3. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
  The only option that matches one of these possible orders is D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  Myers must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Wong and Myers.
  The answer is not given in the choices. Therefore, the most likely answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Therefore, Ortega and Wong cannot be on the team together because if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be, which means Ortega cannot be on the team.
  Paine and Schmidt must be on the team together.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Paine and Schmidt.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If we choose Myers, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. So, we can eliminate Ortega and Paine.
  If we choose Schmidt, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. So, we can eliminate Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson.
  If we choose Wong, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. So, we can eliminate Wong and Myers.
  The remaining employees are Thomson, Ortega, Yoder, and Zayre.
  The only pair among these employees is Thomson and Yoder.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Thomson and Yoder.
Action: Answer("D")

  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Ortega and Wong are not compatible because if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, but if Myers is on the team, Ortega cannot be on the team.
  Yoder and Zayre are not compatible because there is no constraint between them.
  If Paine is on the team, Schmidt and Thomson must also be on the team.
  Therefore, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Thomson and Schmidt.
  The answer is D: Thomson and Yoder.
Action: Answer("D")

  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio is assigned to the project.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Yoshio could be assigned to 1922.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the only unknown lab assistant is one of Kevin or Rebecca who will lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  So, we can determine the sessions led by four lab assistants: Julio, Lan, Olivia, and Nessa.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so one of them must lead the Wednesday sessions and the other must lead the Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  Therefore, we know the following:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day.
  - Nessa leads an afternoon session.
  - Lan and Olivia lead sessions on different days.
  - Julio's session is on an earlier day than Olivia's.
  We can determine the following:
  - Since Lan and Olivia lead sessions on different days, and one of them leads the Wednesday sessions and the other leads the Friday sessions, we know which sessions they lead.
  - Since Nessa leads an afternoon session, and there is only one afternoon session left (Friday afternoon), we know which session she leads.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by 4 of the lab assistants (Lan, Olivia, Nessa, and either Kevin or Rebecca).
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Lan cannot lead a session that meets on the same day as Olivia, so she must lead the Wednesday morning session.
  Therefore, only one lab assistant's session is undetermined, which is Kevin's session.
  The answer is A: one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead a session on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia must lead a session on Friday.
  Therefore, we know the following:
  - Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  - Kevin and Rebecca lead sessions on the same day.
  - Lan and Olivia lead sessions on different days.
  - Nessa leads an afternoon session.
  - Julio's session is earlier in the week than Olivia's.
  We can determine which sessions five of the lab assistants lead based on these constraints. The only lab assistant whose session we cannot determine is the one who is not Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Olivia, Nessa, or Julio.
  Therefore, the answer is E: five.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, but it is not clear which day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but it is not clear which day.
  Lan cannot lead a session on Thursday or Friday because Olivia is leading the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday.
  There are two remaining lab assistants: Kevin and Nessa.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, but it is not clear which day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, but it is not clear which day.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by Lan and Olivia.
  We can also determine the session led by Julio.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by three of the lab assistants.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead the Friday sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Julio must lead the Thursday afternoon session and Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  Therefore, we know the assignments of all the lab assistants except for one.
  The remaining lab assistant is either Kevin or Nessa.
  If Kevin leads the Wednesday morning session, then we know the assignments of all the lab assistants.
  Therefore, for five of the other lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead.
  The answer is E: five.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the only unknown is which lab assistant will lead the Wednesday morning session.
  For the other five lab assistants, we can determine which session they lead.
  The answer is 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead either the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday afternoon.
  This leaves Lan, Kevin, Nessa, Olivia, and Rebecca to be assigned to the remaining four sessions.
  Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, they must lead the Friday sessions.
  Therefore, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia must lead the Wednesday morning, Thursday morning, and Friday morning sessions, but it is not known which assistant leads which session.
  Therefore, for three of the other lab assistants (Lan, Nessa, and Olivia), one can determine which sessions they lead.
  The answer is C: three.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Julio cannot lead any of the other sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so one of them must lead the Wednesday morning session and the other must lead the Friday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so one of them must lead the Wednesday afternoon session and the other must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, we know the assignments for Nessa, Lan, and Olivia, as well as either Kevin or Rebecca.
  We do not know the assignment for the remaining lab assistant, so the answer is A: one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the only remaining session is the Wednesday morning session, which must be led by either Kevin or Rebecca.
  Therefore, we can determine the session assignments for all the lab assistants except for one of Kevin and Rebecca.

  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    - If this is true, then Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 4, because Hidalgo's watercolor is already displayed there.
    - Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1, 2, or 3.
    - However, if Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 1, then Franz's oil must also be displayed on wall 1, which violates the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
    - Therefore, it is impossible for Isaacs's watercolor to be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    - E cannot be true.

  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  A cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then wall 1 would have only the work of Franz and Greene.
  B cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 2 would have only the work of Franz and Hidalgo.
  C can be true because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so it is possible that Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D can be true because we don't have any information that contradicts this statement.
  E cannot be true because if Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 3 would have only the work of Isaacs and Hidalgo.
  Therefore, the answer is E.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 15 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?

  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  Let's consider each pair of students:
    - George and Lenore: George can only give a report on Tuesday, so this pair cannot give reports on the same day as each other.
    - Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Helen gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair can only give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
    - Irving and Robert: We don't have any information about these two students that would require them to give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
    - Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, this pair can only give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.

  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  Let's consider each pair of students and see if they can be the answer.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Helen gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then she must give a report on Wednesday with Irving if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday.
  If Irving gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then he must give a report on Wednesday with Helen if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday.
  If Kyle gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then he cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Lenore gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then she cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then she cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.

  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on who gives reports on the next day.
  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  Let's try to eliminate some choices.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the answer.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they cannot be part of the answer.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, so they cannot be part of the answer.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, so they could be part of the answer.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on who gives reports on the next day, so any pair of students could be part of the answer.
  Let's try to eliminate more choices.
  Kyle and Nina could be a pair who give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  However, we don't know if Nina will give a report at all, so we cannot be sure.
  Lenore is the only student left who has not been eliminated yet.
  Therefore, George and Lenore must be the pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")

- George can only give a report on Tuesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, if Kyle gives a report on Tuesday, he must give it in the morning and Olivia must give her report in the afternoon. This means that Kyle cannot be paired with anyone who gives a report on the same day as him.
- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then George must give his report on Monday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Kyle gives a report on Monday, he must give it in the morning and Olivia must give her report in the afternoon. This means that Kyle cannot be paired with anyone who gives a report on the same day as him.
- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then George must give his report on Monday, and Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday. Therefore, if Kyle gives a report on Monday, he must give it in the morning and Olivia must give her report in the afternoon. This means that Kyle cannot be paired with anyone who gives a report on the same day as him.
- This leaves us with the possibility that Nina does not give a report at all. In this case, Helen and Irving must give their reports on Tuesday, and George must give his report on Monday. This means that if Kyle gives a report on Monday, he must give it in the afternoon, and Olivia must give her report in the morning. Therefore, if Kyle gives a report on Wednesday, he must give it in the morning, and Olivia must give her report in the afternoon.
- The only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other is Kyle and Nina.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Kyle and Nina.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the first or the second lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Based on the above deductions, we can determine which of the answer choices could be true.
  Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which is the last lecture.
  Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture because Jiang's lecture must be the last lecture, and we know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  Holden can give the sculptures lecture because we know that the watercolors lecture is third and Jiang's lecture must be the last lecture.
  Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture because the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which is the last lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture must be the last two lectures.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture must be the first or second lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Therefore, Holden gives the first lecture, and Farley gives the second lecture.
  Since Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture are the last two lectures, Garcia and Jiang must give the third and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one gives which lecture.
  Therefore, A, B, and D are impossible.
  The only possible answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be the last lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Based on the above constraints, we can determine which of the choices could be true.
  Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be the first.
  Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because the watercolors lecture is already third.
  Garcia could give the sculptures lecture because we do not have any constraints on who gives the sculptures lecture.
  Holden could give the sculptures lecture because we do not have any constraints on who gives the sculptures lecture.
  Jiang must give the lithographs lecture because it is the only lecture left.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first one.
  Based on the above, we can determine the following:
  - Lecture 1: Holden's lecture (either sculptures or oil paintings)
  - Lecture 2: Farley's lecture (either oil paintings or sculptures)
  - Lecture 3: Watercolors lecture
  - Lecture 4: Lithographs lecture
  Now we can check each choice:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. False, because the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. True, because Garcia's lecture can only be the last one, which is the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. True, because Holden's lecture can be either sculptures or oil paintings, and Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. True, because the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  Therefore, the possible choices are C, D, and E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, the order of the lectures must be either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one of them gives which lecture.
  If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, then Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, and Farley gives the sculptures lecture. However, this violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the order of the lectures must be sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs. In this case, Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, Farley gives the watercolors lecture, and Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
  The only option that could be true is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the first or the second lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Based on the above, we can determine the order of the lectures: Holden, Farley, Watercolors, Oil Paintings, Lithographs.
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, Farley gives the second lecture, which is not the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. False, Garcia gives the fourth lecture, which is the lithographs lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. False, Garcia does not give the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. True, Holden gives the first lecture, which is the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. False, Jiang gives the last lecture, which is the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one of them gives which lecture.
  If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs, then Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, and Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. Farley must give the sculptures lecture, and the only lecture left is the watercolors lecture, which means Holden gives the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture. 
  If the order of the lectures is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs, then Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, and Garcia must give the oil paintings lecture. Farley must give the sculptures lecture, and the only lecture left is the watercolors lecture, which means Holden gives the watercolors lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  The only possible option is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third, so the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  If Holden's lecture is the first lecture, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one is which.
  If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs, then Farley's lecture must be the sculptures lecture.
  If the order of the lectures is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs, then Farley's lecture must be the watercolors lecture.
  Therefore, it is possible that Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  It is also possible that Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, since the order of the lectures could be sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  It is not possible that Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, since Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Holden's lecture is the first lecture.
  It is possible that Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  It is possible that Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, since the order of the lectures could be sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the first or the second lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Based on the above, we can determine the order of the lectures as follows: 
  Holden -> Farley -> Watercolors -> Oil Paintings -> Lithographs
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, Farley gives the second lecture, which is before the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. True, Garcia gives the fourth lecture, which is the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. False, Garcia does not give the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. False, Holden does not give the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. False, Jiang gives the last lecture, which is the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the first or the second.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first.
  Based on the above deductions, we can determine which of the choices could be true.
  Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture because Holden's lecture must be the first.
  Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture because Jiang's lecture must be the last.
  Holden can give the sculptures lecture because the sculptures lecture is not the first lecture.
  Jiang must give the lithographs lecture because it is the only lecture left.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, P is the only zoologist selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, if K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then K cannot be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F can be selected.
  Therefore, A and B are false.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either L or M. Therefore, C is false.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be any two of the three chemists. Therefore, D and E are false.
  None of the above choices are true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then G or H must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If G is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If H is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then either F, G, or H must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Therefore, if K is selected, then G or H must be selected.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q or R is selected, then M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If both P and R are selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Therefore, if K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  The answer is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If F is selected, then G and H cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then M cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Let's try to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  Choice A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if K and F are not selected, then G can be selected.
  Choice B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if L and M are selected, then F can be selected.
  Choice C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true. For example, if F, G, K, P, and Q are selected, then only one chemist is selected and it is not K.
  Choice D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, they must be any two of K, L, and M. If F is selected, then the condition that at most one zoologist is selected cannot be fulfilled.
  Choice E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true. For example, if F, K, L, P, and Q are selected, then exactly two chemists are selected and G can be selected.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 4:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected as well.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so P cannot be the only zoologist selected.
  If G is selected, then K cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then K and M cannot both be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then L must be selected and K and M cannot both be selected.
  This means that F and G must be selected, and C and H cannot be selected.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, at most one botanist is selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, M is not selected.
  If F and K cannot both be selected, and K is not selected, then F must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one botanist is selected.
  If L is selected, then G must be selected.
  Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  The only option that is true is B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, F cannot be selected if P is the only zoologist selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, A must be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If F is selected, then G and H cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F and M cannot be selected.
  Let's evaluate each choice:
    A. If K is selected, then F and M cannot be selected. This choice does not provide any information about G.
    B. If L is selected, then K and M cannot be selected. This choice does not provide any information about F.
    C. If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. This choice is not necessarily true.
    D. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they can be KL, KM, or LM. If KL is selected, then F, G, and H must be selected. If KM is selected, then F cannot be selected. If LM is selected, then F, G, and H must be selected. Therefore, this choice is not necessarily true.
    E. If exactly two chemists are selected, then they can be KL, KM, or LM. If KL is selected, then F, G, and H must be selected. If KM is selected, then F cannot be selected. If LM is selected, then F, G, and H must be selected. Therefore, this choice is true.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected as well.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so P cannot be the only zoologist selected.
  Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, A must be true.
Action: Answer("A")

Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and either Stuckey or Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2 and either Stuckey or Parra works in Zone 3.
  In either case, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Stuckey.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is not in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao is not in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is not in Zone 1.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is not in Zone 2.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is not in Zone 2.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then Udall is also in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 3, then Stuckey is also in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Stuckey is in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are in Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Parra is in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Udall and Stuckey are in Zone 3, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must also work in Zone 1, which means Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1 and Parra must work in Zone 3. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 3, which satisfies the given information that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 2 with Stuckey and Udall.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Parra must also work in Zone 3. This would mean that Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Udall, and Tiao must work in Zone 1 and there would be no sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  The only remaining option is Zone 1, which means Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must be together.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they must be together.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey would have to work in Zone 3, which would mean that Tiao and Udall would also have to work in Zone 3, which would be more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall would have to work in Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively, which would mean that Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Stuckey would all have to work in Zone 3, which would be more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Kim, Mahr, Parra, and Stuckey would all have to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, which would mean that Tiao and Udall would also have to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively, which would be more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as C: Stuckey.

Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is:
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible positions for Stanton are 1st, 2nd, 5th, and 6th.
  Stanton could have been recruited third or fourth, so the answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is as follows: 
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  Therefore, the only possible positions for Stanton are third and fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Stanton].
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White].
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Quinn, Rovero, ...]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is as follows: [..., Peters, ...]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is as follows: [..., Villas, White, ...]
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: [Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, ..., ...]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Stanton, ..., Tao, ...]
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Tao, Stanton, ..., ...]
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao, Villas, White]
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, Stanton, Tao, White]
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment is as follows: [Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Tao, Stanton]
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fourth or earlier.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn was recruited before Peters.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first, second, or third.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton was recruited either first, second, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Quinn was recruited first, second, or third, then Stanton could have been recruited fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton could have been recruited fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  The answer is D: fifth.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is either A: first, B: second, or E: seventh.
  However, if Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must be recruited second, and Peters must be recruited fourth, which contradicts the given information that Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: second or E: seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao must be recruited first, and Peters must be recruited fourth, which satisfies all the given information.
  Therefore, the answer is B: second.
Action: Answer("B")

  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited in the third position and Rovero was recruited in the fourth position.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters was recruited after Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton was not recruited in the fifth position.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited in the sixth position and White was recruited in the seventh position.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton could not have been recruited in the fifth position.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited fifth and Rovero was recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Stanton was recruited either first, second, third, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao was recruited second and Quinn was recruited third, which contradicts the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao was recruited first and Quinn was recruited third, which contradicts the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Tao was recruited second and Quinn was recruited fourth, which contradicts the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Tao was recruited sixth and Quinn was recruited fifth, which satisfies all the given information.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first, second, third, or fifth, but he could have been recruited seventh.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, ?, ?, ?].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is: [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  Therefore, the remaining two accomplices are Stanton and Tao, and they must be recruited in the order [Stanton, Tao] or [Tao, Stanton].
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before Tao, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, Tao].
  If Tao was recruited immediately before Stanton, then the order of the accomplices is: [?, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  In either case, Stanton was recruited third or fourth.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screen is screen 1 or screen 2.
  The western begins before the horror film, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 or screen 2 if the western is shown on the same screen.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2 if it is not shown alone on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3 if it is not shown alone on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be shown on the same screen.
  Therefore, the only possible schedule is:
  Screen 1: Western at 7 P.M. and Sci-fi at 9 P.M.
  Screen 2: Horror at 7 P.M. and Mystery at 9 P.M.
  Screen 3: Romance at 8 P.M.
  So, the mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  The answer is B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only screen that can show both movies is screen 1 or screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither of them can be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does, so it cannot begin at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the only possible schedule is:
  Screen 1: Western (7 P.M.), Sci-fi (9 P.M.)
  Screen 2: Horror (7 P.M.), Mystery (9 P.M.)
  Screen 3: Romance (8 P.M.)
  The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M., so the answer is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.

  Screen 3 shows exactly one movie, so the romance cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2.
  The horror film is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 3.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the horror film is shown on screen 1.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the mystery must be shown on screen 2 and the romance must be shown on screen 3.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 29 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: Which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one?
Choices:
  A: Yardsign
  B: Vegemite, Wellspring
  C: Vegemite, Yardsign
  D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  E: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign, Zircon
Response 0:
Thought:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the first three bands.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, the band that performs in slot one must be Yardsign or one of the two bands that perform in the slots before Yardsign.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, the band that performs in slot one cannot be Xpert, Zircon, or Wellspring.
  The only band left that can perform in slot one is Vegemite.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Vegemite, Wellspring.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the first three bands.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite and Wellspring also perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, but they are not guaranteed to perform in the first three slots.
  Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite and Wellspring, so it cannot perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot perform in slot one.
  The answer is A: Yardsign.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the bands that can perform in the first three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, the band that performs in slot one must be one of the following combinations:
  - Yardsign
  - Vegemite, Wellspring
  - Vegemite, Yardsign
  - Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign
  None of the other bands can perform in slot one because they are either scheduled to perform later or they cannot perform in the first three slots.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  According to the constraints, Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite and Wellspring each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, but it is not known which slot Xpert will perform in.
  Zircon performs in a later slot than Vegemite and Wellspring.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it is not possible for Uneasy to perform in slot one.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Yardsign.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We are looking for a list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one.
  The list of bands that could perform in slot one is the list of bands that perform in an earlier slot than Xpert and that satisfy the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  The only list that satisfies these conditions is Vegemite and Wellspring.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Vegemite, Wellspring.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot one, Vegemite cannot perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, if Xpert performs in slot one, neither Wellspring nor Zircon can perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one.
  Based on the above constraints, the only band that could perform in slot one is Yardsign.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Yardsign.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The band that performs in slot one must be one of the first three bands.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could be the band that performs in slot one.
  Vegemite and Wellspring each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, but Xpert is not one of the first three bands.
  Therefore, Vegemite and Wellspring could be the bands that perform in slot one.
  The band that performs in slot one cannot be Zircon because Zircon must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of bands any one of which could be the band that performs in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.
  The answer is D: Vegemite, Wellspring, Yardsign.

Thought:
  We need to find the list of bands that could perform in slot one.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot one, Vegemite cannot perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, if Xpert performs in slot one, neither Wellspring nor Zircon can perform in slot one.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf.
  If H is on the bottom shelf, then F and G must be on the top shelf.
  If F is on the top shelf, then M must also be on the top shelf.
  If I is on the middle shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the middle or top shelf.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the middle or top shelf.
  Therefore, K and O cannot be on the same shelf as each other.
  The only option that must be true is A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the top shelf and H must be on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf.
  If H is on the middle shelf, then M must be on the bottom shelf and F must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F must be on the top or bottom shelf.
  If F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle shelf and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the bottom shelf, then K must be on the top shelf and O must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, K and O are always on the same shelf.
  The answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the top shelf and H must be on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf and F must be on the middle shelf.
  If H is on the middle shelf, then G must be on the bottom shelf and F and M must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and K must be placed on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so M must be placed on the top shelf with F and K.
  Therefore, G and H must be placed on the same shelf as each other on the bottom shelf.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then K must be placed on the top shelf.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  The only answer choice that can be deduced from this information is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so L cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf.
  If L is on the bottom shelf, then O must also be on the bottom shelf.
  F is on the same shelf as M, so they must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, G and H must be on the middle shelf with I.
  The only answer choice that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which contradicts the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then I and H must be placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F implies that K and F cannot be placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M implies that F and M must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then O, K, and either F or M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only choice that must be true is D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, H must be on the top shelf.
  If F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F, then K and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.

Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already assigned to Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  This leaves Kim, Mahr, and Quinn to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Kim and Mahr work in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 3, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  This would mean that there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the fact that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 3, then the other works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 2.
  This means that Stuckey and Quinn work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Mahr.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall works in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 1 with Parra.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2, and Quinn must be in the same zone as Parra. This means that neither Stuckey nor Udall can be in Zone 2, so they must both be in Zone 3. This leaves Kim and Mahr to fill the remaining spots in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one of Parra or Tiao must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn must also be in Zone 3.
  If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall must be in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  If Parra is in Zone 2, then Quinn must also be in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Parra must be in Zone 3 and Quinn must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Tiao must be in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Quinn must be in Zone 2 and Tiao must be in Zone 3.
  The remaining sales representatives, Kim and Mahr, must be in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Parra, and Tiao.
  The answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only sales representatives who could work in Zone 3 are Kim, Mahr, and Quinn.
  However, we also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already working in Zone 3, Tiao must be working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra must be working in Zone 1.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must be working in Zone 1 with Parra.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 3, and Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  The only remaining sales representative is Mahr, who must work in Zone 3 to satisfy the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Stuckey, Tiao, Udall, and Mahr.
  The answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one of Parra or Tiao must be working in Zone 3.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be working in Zone 3.
  This means that Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are the only sales representatives left to be assigned to Zone 1 and Zone 2.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr must be working in Zone 1.
  The only option that includes Stuckey, Tiao, Udall, Parra, and Quinn is E.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  From the given conditions, we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Also, the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  Therefore, the statement that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then either oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday or sugar's third batch is made on Monday.
  If oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday, then sugar's third batch is made on Wednesday. This means that there are at least two batches of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, B is true.
  If sugar's third batch is made on Monday, then oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday. This means that there are exactly two batches of cookies made on Wednesday. Therefore, D is false.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use the schedule to determine which batches are being referred to.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, which means the third batch of sugar cookies is also made on Thursday.
  We can use this information to determine which statements could be false.
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True, since we know that at least one batch is made on Monday, and we have accounted for all other batches)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True, since we have accounted for all batches and there are no two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False, since we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we have accounted for all other batches)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True, since we have accounted for all batches and there are no two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True, since we have accounted for all batches and there are no two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day)
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use a table to keep track of the batches of cookies made on each day.
  Let's start by filling in the information we know:
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | 1       |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         | 1             | 1     |
| Wednesday | 2       | 2             |       |
| Thursday  |         |               | 2     |
| Friday    | 3       | 3             |       |

  We know that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch. This means that either the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday or the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. Let's consider each case:
  
  Case 1: First batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday
  In this case, the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. This gives us the following table:
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | 1       |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         | 1             | 1     |
| Wednesday | 2       | 2             |       |
| Thursday  |         |               | 2     |
| Friday    | 3       | 3             | 1     |

  We can see that all of the answer choices are true in this case, so this case does not help us eliminate any answer choices.
  
  Case 2: Third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday
  In this case, the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday. The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday. This gives us the following table:
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    |         |               | 3     |
| Tuesday   | 1       | 1             |       |
| Wednesday | 2       | 2             | 1     |
| Thursday  | 3       |               |       |
| Friday    |         | 3             | 2     |

  We can see that in this case, choice C is false because no batches of cookies are made on Monday. Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use the schedule to determine which batches are being referred to.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday and the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday as well.
  This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Using this information, we can determine that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  Therefore, the only choice that could be false is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies and sugar cookies.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday as well.
  Therefore, the false statement must involve Tuesday.
  Statement A is true because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  Statement B is true because we know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. Therefore, there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
  Statement C is false because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and we also know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. Therefore, there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Monday.
  Statement D is true because we know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which is on Wednesday. Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  Statement E is true because we know that exactly one batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, and there are no batches of cookies left to be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the false statement is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:

  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday as well.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday as well.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be false is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Wednesday, then there can be no other batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")

  The answer is A: Quinn.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  This means that Wells cannot be a project member if neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and must also be the project leader.
  Xue is not mentioned in any of the constraints, so Xue could be a project member or not.
  The answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.

  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader.
  If Wells is not a project member, then either Ruiz or Verma must be a project member.
  However, if Ruiz is a project member, then he/she must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Verma must be a project member.
  The answer is C: Verma.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.

  The answer is A: Quinn.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member, because if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and also be the project leader.
  The remaining project member can be any of the other four workers: Smith, Taylor, Verma, or Xue.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, the only way that Wells can be a project member is if both Ruiz and Verma are not project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then Quinn must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Quinn must be a project member.
  The answer is A: Quinn.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member as well, because if Wells is a project member, Smith must also be.

Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters _ _ _ _ _ _.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so the order of recruitment is Peters _ _ _ Stanton _ Tao _ _.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruitment is Peters Quinn _ _ Stanton _ Tao _ _.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters Quinn _ Villas Stanton _ Tao White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters Quinn _ Villas Stanton White Rovero Tao.
  Therefore, Rovero was recruited third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters-?-?-?-?-?-White.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters-?-?-?-?-Villas-White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters-?-?-White-Rovero-Tao-?-Villas.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited after Rovero. Therefore, Quinn must be recruited before White.
  The order of recruitment is Peters-Quinn-?-?-?-Villas-White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited second or sixth.
  The only possible order of recruitment is Peters-Quinn-Stanton-Rovero-Tao-Villas-White.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited sixth.

  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, _, _, _, _, _, _.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters, _, _, _, _, Villas, White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters, _, _, _, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited later than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, _, _, White, Rovero, Tao.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, _, _, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited second or sixth.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either first, third, fourth, or fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is Stanton, Peters, Quinn, _, White, Rovero, Tao, which violates the condition that Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, Stanton, _, White, Rovero, Tao, which violates the condition that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, _, White, Stanton, Rovero, Tao, which violates the condition that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited fourth.
  The order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, _, Stanton, White, Rovero, Tao.
  If Rovero was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Stanton, White, _, Tao, which violates the condition that White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Rovero was recruited sixth.
  The order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, _, Stanton, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Tao was recruited either third or fifth.
  If Tao was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, Tao, Stanton, White, Rovero, _, which violates the condition that Tao was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Stanton.

  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf. Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that each shelf has at least two books. Therefore, if F and M are on the bottom shelf, then at least one more book must be on the bottom shelf.

  Choice D is not possible because O is not on the bottom shelf.
  Choice E is not possible because M is not on the same shelf as F.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know where G, H, I, K, L, and O are placed.
  We can eliminate C and E because they don't have F or M on the bottom shelf.
  We can eliminate D because it has O on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We are left with A and B.
  If A is true, then the remaining books (G, H, I, K, L, O) must be placed on the top and middle shelves. However, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, which means that A cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know where G, H, I, K, L, and O are placed.
  From the given options, the only one that satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf and includes F and M on the same shelf is A: F, M.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
  Option A does not have the same effect because it does not involve M and N.
  Option B does not have the same effect because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  Option C does not have the same effect because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  Option D has the same effect because it involves M and N, and they cannot be published in the same season.
  Option E does not have the same effect because it involves O and N, not M and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the original condition.
  This means that we need to find a condition that ensures that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Choice A does not have the same effect as the original condition because it does not mention N.
  Choice B does not have the same effect as the original condition because it mentions P instead of N.
  Choice C does not have the same effect as the original condition because it mentions P instead of N.
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition because it states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  Choice E does not have the same effect as the original condition because it mentions N instead of M.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:

Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  However, Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  The only painting by Franz that is not displayed yet is his watercolor.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 3.
  Hidalgo's paintings have not been placed yet.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on walls 1 and 4, but it is not clear which painting goes where.
  However, we are asked which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1.
  Since Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 1, the only option that could be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  This is because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Isaacs's watercolor is displayed.
  If Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 1, then Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 4, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only painting that must be displayed on wall 1 is Greene's watercolor.
  The answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, so Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Isaacs's oil is displayed, which is wall 4.
  Hidalgo's paintings have not been placed yet.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that must be displayed on wall 1 is Greene's watercolor.
  The answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of one of the walls 1, 2, or 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then neither Isaacs's oil nor Franz's oil can be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on wall 3, and Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1, and Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then there are only two possible scenarios:
    1. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
    2. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
  If scenario 1 is true, then Helen must give a report on Wednesday, and Irving must give a report on Monday. Therefore, choice A is true.
  If scenario 2 is true, then Helen must give a report on Monday, and Irving must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, choice E is true.
  Therefore, choices A and E could be true.
Action: Answer("AE")

Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then there are only two possible scenarios:
    1. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
    2. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
  From scenario 1, we know that Helen must give a report on Wednesday because she is the only one left who has not given a report. Therefore, A is true.
  From scenario 2, we know that Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday because Nina gave her report on Wednesday. Therefore, B and C are not true. We also know that Olivia cannot give a report on Monday because she cannot give an afternoon report. Therefore, D is not true. We are left with E as a possibility.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the remaining three students who give reports must be Helen, Irving, and Kyle or Lenore.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George must give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving don't have to give reports on the next day.
  If Robert gives a report on Monday, then he must give a report in the morning, which means that George must give a report in the afternoon, which is not possible.
  If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle and Lenore must give reports on Monday, which is not possible since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Nina gives a report on Tuesday.

  George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  Therefore, George, Nina, and Robert cannot give reports on the same day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible since George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day. Therefore, Robert can give a report on Wednesday.
  The only possible option is E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then we know that George will give a report on Tuesday, and Nina and Robert will give reports on Monday and Wednesday in some order.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which is not possible because George is already giving a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
  This means that Helen must give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she cannot give a report on Monday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  The answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be Xue, Wells, or Verma.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, or Taylor.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn, Smith, Taylor, or Xue.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, or Xue.
  The selection for the project is completely determined if one of the project leaders is selected.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some options.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint. So, option A is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which violates the constraint. So, option B is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine the project leader because Quinn can only be a project member if leading the project. So, option C is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we cannot determine the project leader because Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. So, option D is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be a project member. So, the project members are Wells, Smith, and Xue. Since Wells is a project member, Ruiz cannot be a project member or the project leader. Therefore, Xue must be the project leader. This completely determines the selection for the project.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If three workers are selected, then the project leader must be one of them.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be Taylor.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be Smith.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be Wells.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which option will allow us to select exactly three workers for the project and one of them as the project leader while satisfying all the given constraints.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we cannot select Taylor as per the given constraint. So, this option cannot be correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we cannot select Smith as per the given constraint. So, this option cannot be correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we can select Ruiz as the project leader and one more worker from the remaining five workers. But we cannot select Verma as per the given constraint. So, this option cannot be correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we can select Quinn as the project leader and one more worker from the remaining five workers. But we cannot select Verma as per the given constraint. So, this option cannot be correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we can select Quinn as the project leader and one more worker from the remaining five workers. But we cannot select Wells as per the given constraint. So, this option cannot be correct.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are still four workers left to choose from, and the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be selected, and there are only two workers left to choose from. Therefore, this option completely determines the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected, and Smith and Taylor must also be selected. Therefore, this option completely determines the selection.
  The answer is either D or E. However, E is a stronger constraint than D, so the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  Exactly three workers will be selected to be project members and one of them will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This means that Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only possible project members are Xue, Smith, and Verma. However, we cannot determine who the project leader will be.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member. This means that Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the only possible project members are Xue, Ruiz, and Verma. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the only possible project members are Ruiz, Smith, and Taylor. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, the project leader must be Ruiz. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the only possible project members are Smith, Taylor, and Xue. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, the project leader must be Quinn. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the only possible project members are Quinn, Smith, and Taylor. Since Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, the only possible project members are Quinn, Smith, and Taylor. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, the project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Ruiz or Wells.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there can be no project leader.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  The answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be from the group {Wells, Xue, Verma}.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be from the group {Wells, Xue, Ruiz}.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be from the group {Wells, Ruiz, Smith}.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be from the group {Quinn, Taylor, Xue}.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be from the group {Quinn, Taylor, Xue}.
  The only group that has a unique project leader is {Quinn, Taylor, Xue}.
  Therefore, if neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the selection for the project is completely determined.
  The answer is C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be Xue.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the third member must be Xue.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the third member must be Taylor.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the third member must be Xue.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz, and the third member must be Taylor.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that person must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  We need to determine which selection will completely determine the project members and the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we still have three workers to choose from: Ruiz, Taylor, and Wells. We don't know who the project leader will be.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we still have three workers to choose from: Ruiz, Smith, and Wells. We don't know who the project leader will be.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we still have three workers to choose from: Ruiz, Smith, and Wells. We don't know who the project leader will be.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we have four workers to choose from: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. We don't know who the project leader will be.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we have four workers to choose from: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Xue. Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we have three workers to choose from: Quinn, Smith, and Taylor. Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Parra cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Therefore, Quinn also works in Zone 3.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2.
  The only possible option is that Mahr works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Tiao works in Zone 2, Parra must work in Zone 1.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Since Parra works in Zone 1, Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Since Quinn works in Zone 3, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Kim has not been assigned to any sales zone yet. There is no information to determine where Kim works.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Mahr works in Zone 1 or C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Parra cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao already works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3.
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then Quinn also works in Zone 3.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao already works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The only remaining sales representative is Mahr, who must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Udall already works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Udall must work in a different sales zone than Mahr and Stuckey.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 1.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  Since either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Parra already works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  The only option that could be true is A: Kim works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao already works there.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The number of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is greater than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  The only option that could be true is B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao already works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The remaining sales representative, Mahr, works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in Zone 3.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 44 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 respectively?
Choices:
  A: pharmacy, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, veterinarian, toy store, restaurant
  B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
  C: restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy, optometrist, toy store, restaurant
  D: restaurant, toy store, optometrist, restaurant, veterinarian, shoe store, pharmacy
  E: restaurant, optometrist, toy store, restaurant, shoe store, veterinarian, pharmacy
Response 0:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we know that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the only possible order for the businesses is: pharmacy, optometrist or veterinarian, restaurant, any two businesses, restaurant, and toy store. The order of the optometrist and veterinarian is not specified, so we have two possibilities. We can eliminate choices A, C, and D because they do not have the pharmacy and one of the restaurants at either end of the row. We can eliminate choice E because it violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and the restaurant must be at spaces 1 and 7, respectively.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be at space 2 or space 6.
  If the veterinarian is at space 2, then the optometrist must be at space 3, and the shoe store must be at space 4.
  Then, the two restaurants must be at spaces 5 and 7, and the toy store must be at space 6.
  If the veterinarian is at space 6, then the shoe store must be at space 5, and the optometrist must be at space 4.
  Then, the two restaurants must be at spaces 3 and 1, and the toy store must be at space 2.
  Therefore, the only possible order is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Using these constraints, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Option A is not possible because the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist.
  Option B is possible because it satisfies all the constraints.
  Option C is not possible because the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Option D is not possible because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Option E is not possible because the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")

  From the constraints, we know that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at the ends of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  From the choices, we can eliminate A and C because they do not have the pharmacy at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end. We can eliminate D and E because they do not have the pharmacy next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. 
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.

  Using these constraints, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Option A: The pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  Option B: This order satisfies all the constraints.
  Option C: The pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  Option D: The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Option E: The two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.

Response 5:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Based on these constraints, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Answer choice A is not possible because the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist.
  Answer choice B is possible because it satisfies all the constraints.
  Answer choice C is not possible because it violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  Answer choice D is not possible because it violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Answer choice E is not possible because it violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.

Response 6:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can determine that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant at the other end of the row must be separated from the first restaurant by at least two businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in one of the two spaces next to the pharmacy. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in the space next to the toy store. 
  From the constraints, we can also determine that the order of the businesses must be: pharmacy, optometrist or veterinarian, restaurant, two other businesses, restaurant, two other businesses, and toy store.
  Checking the answer choices, only answer choice B follows the constraints.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the constraints, we can infer that the restaurant cannot be in the middle of the row.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  If the restaurant is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 or space 7.

Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later and Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  We need to check which option is consistent with the given conditions.
  
Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, 4th, and 5th. However, this arrangement violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  
Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st. The table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, and 5th, but their order is not determined. Finally, the mirror must be auctioned on June 6th. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, option B is possible.
  
Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This means the table, sundial, and mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, 4th, and 5th. However, this arrangement violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  
Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd. This means the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 4th, 5th, and 6th, but their order is not determined. Finally, the mirror must be auctioned on June 6th. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, option D is possible.
  
Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or earlier. This means the table, sundial, and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, 2nd, and 4th, but their order is not determined. Finally, the sundial must be auctioned on June 6th. This arrangement violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 6th, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to find an option that satisfies all the given conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. So, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This satisfies all the given conditions. So, option B is possible.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial, the mirror, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. So, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase. So, option D is not possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, and the sundial, the table, and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd, but we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, option E is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd or later, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - A: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on that day.
  - C: The vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the sundial must be auctioned on that day.
  - E: The mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th because the vase must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror.
  We are left with answer choices B and D. 
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This satisfies the conditions, so answer choice B could be true.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This also satisfies the conditions, so answer choice D could be true.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to determine which of the given options is possible.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, which means the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, which means the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. This is possible, and the sundial, table, and vase can be auctioned on the remaining days. Therefore, option B is possible.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial and the mirror must be auctioned before the vase, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, which means the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. This is possible, and the sundial, table, and vase can be auctioned on the remaining days. Therefore, option D is possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp, which means the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Therefore, options B and D are possible.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  Let's try to use these conditions to eliminate some choices:
  - The sundial cannot be auctioned on June 1st, so options A, B, and C are not possible.
  - The lamp cannot be auctioned before the harmonica, so option D is not possible.
  - The only option left is E, which says that the mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the mirror can be auctioned before the lamp, and the lamp can be auctioned on June 6th.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  The only possible date for the lamp to be auctioned is June 3rd.
  The harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  The only possible date for the vase to be auctioned is June 4th.
  The only possible date for the table to be auctioned is June 1st.
  The only possible date for the sundial to be auctioned is June 6th.
  The only possible date for the mirror to be auctioned is June 5th.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on these conditions.
  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and it is auctioned before the mirror.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is possible because we do not know the order of the harmonica and the lamp.
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the sundial is auctioned before the vase.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  Therefore, options B, D, and E are possible.
Action: Answer("B, D, E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 4th.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  We can use the above conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which violates the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which violates the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th. 
  Therefore, the only choice that could be true is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House is class 3, so it cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, any scenario where the Yates House is traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings is impossible.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This is impossible because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. - This is possible.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This is impossible because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. - This is impossible because the Yates House is class 3 and the Flores Tower is class 1.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. - This is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This can be true. Southco can trade the Lynch Building for the Yates House, and then trade the Yates House for the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because Southco only owns two buildings.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This can be true. Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the Yates House, and then trade the Yates House for the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:

  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because these buildings are owned by Trustcorp.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because the King Building and the Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp can be the Flores Tower but not the Yates House because the Yates House is owned by RealProp.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Lynch Building is owned by Southco.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp cannot own the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building because they are all class 2 buildings, and RealProp does not own any class 2 buildings.
  Southco cannot own the King Building or the Ortiz Building because they are both class 2 buildings, and Southco does not own any class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower or the Yates House because they are both class 1 and class 3 buildings, respectively, and Trustcorp does not own any class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the three kinds mentioned.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower and Southco does not own the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If a building is traded, it must be traded for a building of the same class.
  Therefore, the class of the buildings owned by each company cannot change.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Not possible because RealProp does not own any class 2 buildings.)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Not possible because Southco does not own any class 3 buildings.)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. (Not possible because Trustcorp does not own any class 1 buildings.)

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If RealProp trades the Yates House or Zimmer House, it must receive one class 3 building in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it must receive two class 2 buildings in return.
  If Southco trades the Lynch Building, it must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  If Trustcorp trades any of its buildings, it must receive one building of the same class in return.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because RealProp does not own the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building.)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible if Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and trades the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (Impossible because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. (Impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (Possible if Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Garza Tower and trades the Meyer Building for the Lynch Building.)
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If a building is traded, it must be traded for a building of the same class or a building of a higher class.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House cannot be traded for the Flores Tower or the Lynch Building because they are of a lower class.
  The Garza Tower is a class 1 building, so it can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all class 2 buildings, so they can only be traded for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building.
  A cannot be true because the buildings owned by RealProp are not owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, not Southco.
  C cannot be true because the King Building is owned by Trustcorp, not Southco.
  D cannot be true because the Yates House is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This cannot be true because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The only way for RealProp to trade one of its class 1 buildings is to trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way for Southco to trade one of its class 1 buildings is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way for Trustcorp to trade one of its class 2 buildings is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House cannot be traded for any of Southco's buildings, and the Flores Tower cannot be traded for any of RealProp's buildings.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of Trustcorp's buildings.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If a building is traded, it must be traded for a building of the same class.
  If a class 1 building is traded, it must be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  If a class 2 building is traded, it must be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices that have buildings from different classes or that have buildings that cannot be traded for each other.
  Answer choice A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  Answer choice B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  Answer choice C cannot be true because Southco does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  Answer choice D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  Answer choice E can be true because Trustcorp owns the Lynch Building and RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which can be traded for each other.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Thought:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E because they do not have at least two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A cannot be correct because it assigns Knutson to the ceremony, which violates the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E because they do not have at least two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A cannot be correct because it includes Knutson, and the prompt states that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's try to assign photographers to the Silva University ceremony based on the given constraints.
  If Frost and Heideck are assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then we can assign Gonzalez and Lai to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Frost and Heideck are assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then we cannot assign Gonzalez to the Silva University ceremony because Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, we can assign Knutson and Mays to the Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, the possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is either Frost, Heideck, Gonzalez, and Lai or Knutson and Mays.
  The answer is either A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson or E: Knutson, Mays.
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option A because it assigns four photographers to the Silva University ceremony, which is more than two.
  We can eliminate option C because it only assigns two photographers to the Silva University ceremony, which is not enough.
  We can eliminate option D because it only assigns two photographers to the Silva University ceremony, which is not enough.
  We can eliminate option E because it only assigns two photographers to the Silva University ceremony, which is not enough.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Exactly six photographers are available, but not all have to be assigned.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  The complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony must satisfy all the given constraints.
  From the given choices, only A and B have Frost and Heideck assigned together.
  Choice A has four photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is more than the minimum required.
  Choice B has three photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is the minimum required.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's try to eliminate the choices that violate the given constraints.
  Choice A violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  Choice B satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies. It also satisfies the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Lai is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. This is allowed because the constraint only says that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. It does not say that Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Gonzalez is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice C does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice D does not satisfy the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice E violates the constraint that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 
Action: Answer("B")

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E because they do not have at least two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A cannot be correct because Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so they cannot be split up.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We need to select a combination of photographers that satisfies all the given constraints.
  Let's evaluate each option:
    - Option A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means Heideck must be assigned to that ceremony. This leaves only Gonzalez and Lai to be assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but Gonzalez cannot be assigned to that ceremony because Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, option A is not valid.
    - Option B: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, and we need at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony. This leaves only Gonzalez available to be assigned to that ceremony. Therefore, option B is valid.
    - Option C: If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. This leaves only Gonzalez available to be assigned to that ceremony, but if Gonzalez is assigned to that ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means we cannot assign Knutson to that ceremony. Therefore, option C is not valid.
    - Option D: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but we need at least two photographers for the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, option D is not valid.
    - Option E: If Mays is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then Lai cannot be assigned to that ceremony. Therefore, we cannot assign Mays to the Thorne University ceremony, which means we cannot assign Knutson to the Silva University ceremony. Therefore, option E is not valid.
  The only valid option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's check each option to see if it is a valid assignment.
  
Option A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  Frost and Heideck are assigned together, which is valid.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is valid.
  Knutson is also assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is not valid because Knutson cannot be assigned to both ceremonies.
  This option is not valid.
  
Option B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  Frost and Heideck are assigned together, which is valid.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is valid.
  This option is valid.
  
Option C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is valid.
  Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is also valid.
  However, we need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony, and this option only assigns one.
  This option is not valid.
  
Option D: Heideck, Lai
  Frost is not assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is not valid because Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  This option is not valid.
  
Option E: Knutson, Mays
  Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which is not valid because if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  This option is not valid.
  
The only valid option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's try to eliminate the choices that violate the given constraints.
  Choice A violates the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  Choice B satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies. It also satisfies the constraint that no photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. However, it does not assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice C does not assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice D does not assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices is:
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. X
  4. X
  5. X
  6. X
  7. X
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is:
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. X
  4. Peters
  5. X
  6. X
  7. X
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of the accomplices is:
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. X
  7. X
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is:
  1. X
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Villas
  7. White
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited third or fourth. Therefore, the only possible option is that Stanton was recruited sixth. 
  The answer is C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices is: [1]Tao, [2], [3], [4]Peters, [5], [6], [7]Villas-White.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order becomes: [1]Tao, [2], [3], [4]Peters, [5], [6]Villas, [7]White.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order becomes: [1]Tao, [2], [3], [4]Peters, [5], [6]Villas-White.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited before Peters.
  Therefore, Quinn could be recruited third, and Rovero could be recruited fifth.
  The answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows: 
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  From the established facts, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. 
  Therefore, Quinn cannot be recruited third because that would mean Rovero would have to be recruited fourth, which is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth. 
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. 
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then White would have to be recruited seventh, which is not possible since Villas was recruited immediately before White. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Rovero was recruited fifth. 
  The answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is: 1, Tao; 2, unknown; 3, unknown; 4, Peters; 5, unknown; 6, unknown; 7, unknown.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be recruited sixth because White is the last accomplice.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [Peters] [5] [6] [7]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could have been recruited third or earlier.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas could have been recruited fifth or earlier.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton could have been recruited first, third, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Rovero could not have been recruited fifth because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, the only possible option is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [Peters] [5] [6] [7].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could be recruited either first or third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas could be recruited either fifth or sixth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton could be recruited either first, third, fifth, or sixth.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [Peters] [5] [Villas] [White].
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Stanton] [Quinn] [Peters] [Rovero] [Villas] [White].
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [Peters] [Villas] [Stanton] [White].
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [Peters] [Villas] [White] [Stanton].
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [White] [Peters] [Villas] [Stanton].
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters and three others, Tao, and three others.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, and five others.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited sixth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited third or earlier.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton cannot be recruited third or fourth. Therefore, Stanton must be recruited fifth or later.

  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Tao was recruited second.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters must have been recruited before Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, White must have been recruited after Villas.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must have been recruited after Quinn.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, then Stanton must have been recruited fourth or sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Villas must have been recruited fifth and White must have been recruited seventh.
  Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, then Villas cannot be recruited sixth.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn must have been recruited third and Stanton must have been recruited sixth.

  4. R, Q, H, Y, G, S, J
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, S cannot be seventh. 
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J cannot be seventh.
  If Y is fourth, then Q, R, H, G, and J must be first, second, third, fifth, and sixth, but it is not clear which one is which.
  If Q is first, then S must be fifth, and R must be second or third. But R cannot be second because G must be earlier than R. Therefore, R must be third. 
  If R is second, then G must be first, and J must be sixth. But H cannot be fourth because H covers finance, and the consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, H must be seventh. But this is not possible because S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, R cannot be second.
  Therefore, Q must be first, and R must be third. 
  If Q is first, then S must be fifth, and G must be second. But J cannot be sixth because J must be earlier than G. Therefore, J must be fourth. 
  The order of the articles is Q, G, R, J, Y, S, H.
  Therefore, the answer is A: J is second.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be fifth and H must be sixth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be fifth and H must be sixth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, second, or fourth. If Q is first, then R must be fifth and G must be sixth, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If Q is second, then R must be fifth and G must be sixth, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If Q is fourth, then R must be fifth, G must be sixth, and H must be seventh. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be fourth and R must be fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. This means that G and R cannot be fourth or fifth, so J must be fourth. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. This means that G and R cannot be fourth or fifth, so J must be fourth. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is third, then Q can be first, second, or third. If Q is first, then R must be fifth or later, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If Q is second, then R must be sixth or later, which also violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. If Q is third, then R can be fifth or later, which satisfies the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means R must be seventh. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means R must be seventh. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second. If Q is first, then G must be fourth, which violates the condition that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, Q must be second, which means J must be first. Then, G must be fifth and H must be sixth. Finally, R must be seventh.
  Therefore, Q is second, and J is first.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be fifth and H must be sixth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be fifth and H must be sixth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second. If Q is first, then G must be fourth, H must be fifth, and R must be sixth. This satisfies all the conditions, and J must be seventh. Therefore, J is third. 
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means R cannot be seventh.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means R cannot be seventh.
  If S is third, then Q can be any position except first, which means R can be seventh.
  If J is earlier than G, and G is earlier than R, then J must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third, and R can be seventh.
  The answer is E: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. But this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q can be either first or second. If Q is first, then R must be sixth and G must be seventh. If Q is second, then R can be either fourth or fifth, and J can be either first or second. But this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  Therefore, S must be third and Q must be first. This means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. J can be either first or second, but it cannot be third because Q must be first.
  The only option that is consistent with these conditions is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be fourth. But this would mean that R is fifth and H is sixth, which violates the rule that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. But this would mean that R is fifth and H is sixth, which violates the rule that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q can be first or second. If Q is first, then G must be second, J must be fourth, R must be fifth, and H must be sixth. If Q is second, then G must be first, J must be fourth, R must be fifth, and H must be sixth.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third, and G must be first or second, and J must be fourth. This means that R is fifth and H is sixth.
  The only answer choice that matches this is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be fourth. But this means R cannot be edited, which is a contradiction.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be fourth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, which means R must be second and G must be fourth. But this means J cannot be edited, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, J must be fourth.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and J must be sixth. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and J must be sixth. This violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is third, then Q can be first, second, or third. If Q is first, then G must be second and J must be seventh. If Q is second, then G must be first and J must be seventh. If Q is third, then G can be first or second, and J must be seventh.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q can be first, second, or third, and J must be seventh.

  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. - This cannot be true because there are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. - This cannot be true because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. - This cannot be true because Himalayans are not featured on day 1, and Greyhounds are only featured on day 1.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. - This could be true because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. - This cannot be true because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, which is a day that Himalayans are not featured.

Response 1:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then the remaining four days must feature the other two breeds.
  If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers must be featured on the remaining four days.
  Therefore, Rottweilers are featured on days 2, 4, 5, and 6.
  Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4.
  Therefore, the remaining three days must feature the third breed, which is Siamese.
  Therefore, Siamese are featured on days 1, 5, and 7.
  Choice A is not possible because each breed is featured on exactly three days.
  Choice B is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Choice C is not possible because Greyhounds are not featured on days 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  Choice D is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

  Option A is not possible because there are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies.
  Option B is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Option C is not possible because Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  Option D is possible because Himalayans are not featured on any day that Rottweilers are.

  Based on the above conditions, we can create a chart to keep track of which breeds are featured on each day.
  From the chart, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C.
  Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  From the given conditions, we can create a schedule of breeds for each day.
  We can then use this schedule to check which statement could be true.
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
    If four breeds are each featured on three days, then one breed is featured on only one day.
    However, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
    Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
    Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
    Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
    Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
    Therefore, Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
    On days 2, 4, and 6, the breeds featured are:
      Day 2: Himalayan and Greyhound
      Day 4: Himalayan and Newfoundland
      Day 6: Himalayan and Manx
    Therefore, D is possible.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
    Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
    Therefore, Rottweilers are featured on days 2, 3, 5, and 6.
    On days 2, 3, 5, and 6, the breeds featured are:
      Day 2: Himalayan and Greyhound
      Day 3: Rottweiler and Manx
      Day 5: Rottweiler and Newfoundland
      Day 6: Himalayan and Manx

  Based on the above conditions, we can create a table to represent the possible combinations of breeds on each day.
  Using the table, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C.
  Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.

  Day 3: Rottweiler and Himalayan
  Day 4: Greyhound and Siamese
  Day 5: Newfoundland and Himalayan
  Day 6: Rottweiler and Manx

Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Each section has exactly two photographs.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has no photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs can only be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  The other photograph in the Sports section cannot be by Gagnon.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

Response 1:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be paired with a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be more than three of Fuentes' photographs in the newspaper.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there would be more than three of Gagnon's photographs in the newspaper.
  If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.

  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs are in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  The number of photographs in the Metro section is four, which means that both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")

  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Metro section.
  The photographs in the Metro section must be taken by Fuentes and Gagnon.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
  Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue because Hue already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.

  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  The answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis, Onyx, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922, 1923, and 1924, respectively.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, and Ryan must be assigned to 1921, 1923, and 1924, respectively.
  Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  The answer is B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two

  E: six
Response 0:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1.
  In both cases, the bay holding fuel must be bay 2 and the bay holding machinery must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined for 4 bays: bays 1, 2, 4, and either 3 or 5.
Action: Answer("C")

  B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre
  C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre
  D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre
  E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers, Ortega, and Paine cannot be on the team together.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  Based on the above conditions, a possible selection of employees for the team is: Schmidt, Paine, Thomson, and Wong.
  Therefore, the answer is not A, not B, not C, Answer("D").
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  From the choices, only option E satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 1, and there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, which is more than the number of sales representatives in Zone 3. This is not possible.
  Therefore, Udall works in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, and they must both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 3, and Mahr works in Zone 1.
  The only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 is either 1 or 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then Parra works in Zone 1 and Quinn works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then either Quinn or Kim works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then there are 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2.
  If there are 5 sales representatives in Zone 1, then either Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao could work in Zone 1, which means that Udall works in Zone 2 and Parra works in Zone 3.
  The answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1, and there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, because if Tiao works in Zone 1, then there can be at most 1 other sales representative working in Zone 1, which is less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn works in Zone 1 with Parra, and Stuckey works in Zone 2 with Tiao and Udall.
  Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, and they must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at least two sales representatives in Zone 1 and at least one sales representative in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then Parra and Quinn are either both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey and Udall are either both in Zone 1, both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and the other works in Zone 3. Then, Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2 and 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. This is not consistent with the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there must be 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 1, and the other two sales representatives are in Zone 2 and Zone 3. Therefore, there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2 and 1 sales representative in Zone 3. This is consistent with the given information that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  The only choice that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 and either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3, 4, 5, or 6 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 3 and Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra. This means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Udall. This means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3. This means there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2. Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2. This eliminates choice A.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 3. This means there are 5 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3. This eliminates choice E.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Mahr can work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore, choices B and C could be true.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3 and Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra. This means there are at least 2 sales representatives in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. This eliminates choice D.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that Quinn must also work in Zone 3. But this would mean that there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey must also work in Zone 3. But this would mean that there are at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 3, which satisfies the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, Parra can work in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  This means that there are exactly 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which satisfies the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left. We don't know which zone they work in.
  Therefore, the answer could be either A: Kim works in Zone 2 or B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then there are either 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are either both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they are either both in Zone 1 or both in Zone 3.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If there are 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, then Kim and Mahr must work in Zone 1 and Zone 3, respectively.
  If there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 2, then Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, and the remaining sales representatives must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3 and at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there can be at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there must be exactly 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and there are exactly 7 sales representatives.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3, and the remaining sales representatives must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
  Since there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 1, and Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, then the only possibility is that Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 2.
  The remaining sales representatives are Kim and Mahr, and we do not have any information about their sales zones.
  Therefore, both A and B could be true.
  Parra works in Zone 2, so C is not true.
  Tiao works in Zone 1, so D is true.
  Udall works in Zone 3, so E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2 and either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3, 4, 5, or 6 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1. This means that there are at most 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, which still contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that there are exactly 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, and 1 sales representative in Zone 3. This satisfies all the given conditions and the condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which means Seamus cannot test F.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test either G, H, or J on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test either G or J on the first day.
  On the second day, Theresa cannot test J, so Theresa must test either F, G, or H.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the second day, which means Seamus cannot test J.
  Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the second day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so Seamus must test either F, G, or H.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo must test either F or J.
  If Reynaldo tests F, then Seamus must test G, and Yuki must test H. This means that Seamus cannot test H on the first day, so Reynaldo must test J.
  If Reynaldo tests J, then Seamus must test F or H, and Yuki must test G or H.
  If Seamus tests F, then Yuki must test H, and Theresa must test G. This means that Seamus cannot test H on the second day, so Seamus must test H on the first day.
  If Seamus tests H, then Yuki must test G, and Theresa must test F. This means that Reynaldo cannot test F on the second day, so Reynaldo must test G.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")

  Therefore, Theresa cannot test G on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day.
  Seamus tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  The only possible option is that Yuki tests H on the second day.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F, G, or H on the first day.

  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G, H, or J on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests either G or J on the first day.
  If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the first day and H on the second day.
  If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the first day and G on the second day.
  Yuki tests the remaining bicycle on the first day and the remaining bicycle on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test G on the second day, which means Seamus cannot test H on the second day.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we are left with six students: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to determine who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. However, if Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday.
  If Olivia or Robert gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then they cannot give a morning report because they cannot give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the only students who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are Helen, Irving, and Nina.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.

  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then no one is required to give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  From the remaining answer choices, we can check if they satisfy the given conditions.
  Answer choice A: Helen, George, and Nina - This is not possible because George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Answer choice B: Irving, Robert, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  Answer choice C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia - This is not possible because if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  Answer choice D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving - This is possible because none of the given conditions are violated.
  Answer choice E: Robert, George, and Helen - This is not possible because Robert cannot give an afternoon report.

  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We can use the given conditions to create a chart to keep track of which students can give reports on which days and in which time slots.
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | ?                | ?                |
| Tuesday   | ?                | ?                |
| Wednesday | ?                | ?                |

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so we can fill that in:
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | ?                | ?                |
| Tuesday   | George           | ?                |
| Wednesday | ?                | ?                |

  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so we can fill in their morning reports:
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | ?                | Robert/Olivia    |
| Tuesday   | George           | Olivia/Robert    |
| Wednesday | ?                | Nina/Irving/Helen |

  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. So, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday and Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday. Let's consider each case:
  
  Case 1: Nina gives a report on Monday
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Nina             | Robert/Olivia    |
| Tuesday   | George           | Olivia/Robert    |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving     | Nina             |

  In this case, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, so they cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Tuesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Nina             | Robert/Olivia    |
| Tuesday   | Olivia/Robert    | George           |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving     | Nina             |

  Case 2: Nina gives a report on Tuesday
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Robert/Olivia     | Nina            |
| Tuesday   | George           | Olivia/Robert    |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving     | Nina             |

  In this case, Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, so they cannot give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Tuesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Robert/Olivia     | Nina            |
| Tuesday   | Olivia/Robert    | George           |
| Wednesday | Helen/Irving     | Nina             |

  Case 3: Nina gives a report on Wednesday
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Robert/Olivia     | Nina            |
| Tuesday   | George           | Olivia/Robert    |
| Wednesday | Nina             | Helen/Irving     |

  In this case, Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday, so the morning reports on Tuesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  
| Day       | Morning          | Afternoon        |
| --------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| Monday    | Robert/Olivia     | Nina            |
| Tuesday   | Olivia/Robert    | George           |
| Wednesday | Nina             | Helen/Irving     |

  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia and Robert, Olivia and Robert, and Nina, which is choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine who can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since there are two reports each morning, we need to find three students who can give morning reports.
  We know that George cannot give a morning report on Monday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give morning reports on any day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving can give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  The remaining students who can give a morning report on Monday are George and Olivia.
  The remaining student who can give a morning report on Tuesday is Robert.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by George, Helen, and Olivia.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left.
  We can try to use the conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But this is impossible because George must give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday. This means that they can give reports on Monday. But we still need one more student to give a report on Monday. This student cannot be Olivia or Robert because they cannot give afternoon reports. This leaves us with George, Kyle, and Lenore. But we know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so the only option left is George.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by George, Irving, and Olivia.
  The answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly six students will give reports, so two students will not give reports.
  We also know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We can use the conditions to create a table to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  
| Day       | Morning Report 1 | Morning Report 2 |
| ---------|-----------------|------------------|
| Monday    | George          |                 |

| Wednesday |                 |                  |

  We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they cannot be the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We can eliminate choices A, C, and E because they include Kyle or Lenore as a possible morning report.
  We are left with choices B and D.
  We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must be the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Irving, Robert, and Helen.

  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on the next day.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
  Therefore, Olivia and Robert will give the morning reports on Monday and Tuesday, and Helen will give the morning report on Wednesday.
  The answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Let's try to use the conditions to eliminate some choices.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then we need to find two students to give reports with him. 
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But we only have George left to give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. But we only have Olivia and Robert left to give reports on Wednesday, and they cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports. Therefore, Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  So, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, Irving, and Nina.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But George can only give a report on Tuesday, so Nina cannot give a report on Monday. Therefore, Nina's report must be given on Wednesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday and Tuesday, respectively.
  The remaining students are George, Olivia, and Robert. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, George, Olivia, and Robert can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  The answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine which shelf F and K are placed on.
  If we know that K and G are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine which shelf F and K are placed on.
  If we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine which shelf O is placed on.
  If we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf, then we cannot determine which shelf each of the books is placed on.
  If we know that H and O are placed on the same shelf, then we cannot determine which shelf each of the books is placed on.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or C.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a diagram of the bookcase.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can place I in the middle row of the diagram.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on the same row.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top row and F and M must be on the middle row.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top row and L must be on the middle or bottom row.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so L must be on the bottom row.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so G and H must be on the same row as another book.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F and K must be on the top shelf and O, L, G, and H must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all of the conditions, so the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can assume that the top shelf has two books, the middle shelf has three books, and the bottom shelf has three books.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so either both of them are on the top shelf or both of them are on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if F is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If F is on the bottom shelf, then K must be on the top or middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is on the top shelf, then O must be on the middle or bottom shelf. If L is on the middle or bottom shelf, then O must be on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know that F and M are on the same shelf, which means that F and M are on the bottom shelf. This also means that K is on the middle shelf and O is on the top shelf. Therefore, this statement is true and the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We can see that the placement of the books is fully determined if we know which two books are placed on the same shelf as each other and their shelf. 
  The only option that provides this information is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know which shelf F is on.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf F, I, L, H, or O is on.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf I, K, H, or O is on.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf F, I, K, L, or O is on.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know which shelf F, I, K, L, or M is on.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can place F and M on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M. Therefore, K must be on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the same shelf as L and F/M. Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so L must be on the bottom shelf.
  We are left with placing G and H on the remaining shelf, which can be either the middle or top shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on either the top or bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the same shelf as L.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can place at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can place F on the opposite shelf and K on the remaining shelf. We can then place O on the same shelf as L. This arrangement satisfies all the conditions, so the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on the same shelf as I.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so there must be at least 2 books on the middle shelf.
  We can now try to place the remaining books on the shelves based on the given conditions.
  If we assume that L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, we can place them on the middle shelf with I and M. This leaves G, H, and O to be placed on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined the placement of all the books based on the given conditions.
  The answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on the same shelf as I.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  We know that at least 2 books are placed on each shelf, so there must be at least 2 books on the middle shelf.
  We can now try to place the remaining books on the shelves based on the given conditions.
  If we assume that L and F are placed on the same shelf, we can place them on the middle shelf and place G, H, and O on the bottom shelf.
  However, this does not satisfy the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, the answer must be one of the other choices.
  If we assume that K and G are placed on the same shelf, we can place them on the top shelf and place H, L, and O on the bottom shelf.
  This satisfies all of the given conditions, so the answer is B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to create a partial order of the articles.
  J < G < R
  S < Q
  If S is before Q, then Q must be third.
  S < Q < R
  Y > S
  We can use the partial order to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If R is fourth, then the only remaining articles are H and Y, which both cover different topics than R. However, we cannot determine the order of H and Y.
  If H is fourth, then the remaining articles are J, G, R, Q, S, and Y. We can use the partial order to determine the order of the articles.
  J < G < R < Q < S < Y < H
  If H is sixth, then the remaining articles are J, G, R, Q, S, and Y. We can use the partial order to determine the order of the articles.
  J < G < R < Q < S < H < Y
  If Y is fifth, then the remaining articles are J, G, R, Q, and S. We can use the partial order to determine the order of the articles.
  J < G < R < S < Q < Y < H
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is fourth or H is sixth.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We have seven articles to edit.
  Three of them are about finance, three are about nutrition, and one is about wildlife.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the positions of the others.
  If H is fourth, we don't know the positions of Q, R, and S.
  If H is sixth, we don't know the positions of Q, R, and S.
  If R is fourth, we can determine the positions of G, J, Q, S, and Y.
  If R is seventh, we can determine the positions of Q, S, G, J, H, and Y.
  If Y is fifth, we don't know the positions of Q, R, and S.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the order of the rest.
  Let's evaluate each choice to see if it helps us determine the order of the articles.
  
Action:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know the position of any of the other finance or nutrition articles. This choice doesn't help us determine the order of the articles. Eliminate A.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first, followed by the three nutrition articles, and then the wildlife article. We can determine the order of the articles. Keep B.
  C: If R is fourth, we don't know the position of any of the other finance or nutrition articles. This choice doesn't help us determine the order of the articles. Eliminate C.
  D: If R is seventh, we don't know the position of any of the other finance or nutrition articles. This choice doesn't help us determine the order of the articles. Eliminate D.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that S must be first, followed by Q, then the three finance articles, and then the wildlife article. We can determine the order of the articles. Keep E.
  
Therefore, the answer is either B or E. We need to evaluate both choices to determine the correct answer.

Action:
  B: If H is sixth, the order of the articles is: G, Q, S, R, J, H, Y. This satisfies all of the conditions. The answer is B.
  E: If Y is fifth, the order of the articles is: S, Q, G, R, J, H, Y. This satisfies all of the conditions. The answer is B.
  
Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  We need to find a condition that will help us determine the order of the articles.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S is either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. This means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. This leaves H and J to be fourth and fifth, but we don't know which one is which.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. This means R must be seventh and G must be sixth. This leaves H and J to be fourth and fifth, but we don't know which one is which.
  If S is third, then Q must be first and R must be fourth. This means G must be fifth, H must be sixth, and J must be seventh.
  If Y is not fifth, then S must be second or third. This means Q must be third. If S is second, then R must be seventh and G must be sixth. This leaves H and J to be fourth and fifth, but we don't know which one is which. If S is third, then Q must be first and R must be fourth. This means G must be fifth, H must be sixth, and J must be seventh.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the order of all the articles.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know the positions of Q, R, S, and Y. We cannot determine the order of the articles.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the first five articles cannot be finance articles. We also know that the first five articles cannot be nutrition articles. Therefore, the first five articles must be Q, R, S, Y, and J in some order. Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, we can determine that the order of the first five articles is Q, R, S, Y, J, and the last article must be G or H. Therefore, we cannot determine the order of all the articles.
  C: If R is fourth, we know that the first three articles must be nutrition articles. Therefore, the first three articles must be Q, S, and R in some order. Since S must be earlier than Y, the fourth article must be Y. We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order of the last three articles is J, G, and H. Therefore, we can determine the order of all the articles.
  D: If R is seventh, we know that the first three articles must be nutrition articles. Therefore, the first three articles must be Q, S, and R in some order. Since S must be earlier than Y, the fourth article must be Y. We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order of the last three articles is J, G, and H. Therefore, we can determine the order of all the articles.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that the first four articles must be nutrition articles. Therefore, the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and J in some order. Since S must be earlier than Y, the fifth article must be S. We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, the order of the last three articles is J, G, and H. Therefore, we can determine the order of all the articles.
  
  The only option that allows us to determine the order of all the articles is C. Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first and Q must be third.
  If H is fourth, then G must be first and J must be second.
  If H is sixth, then R must be first and G must be second.
  If R is fourth, then Y must be seventh and S must be first.
  If R is seventh, then G must be first, J must be second, H must be third, Q must be fourth, S must be fifth, and Y must be sixth.
  Therefore, the answer is D: R is seventh.

  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh.
  If H is fourth, then G must be first, J must be second, and the nutrition articles must be sixth and seventh.
  If H is sixth, then the finance articles must be first, second, and third, and the nutrition articles must be fourth, fifth, and sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the wildlife article must be seventh, and the finance articles must be first, second, and third.
  If R is seventh, then the finance articles must be first, second, and third, and the wildlife article must be seventh.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, but we don't know the order of the finance articles or the position of Y. So, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the order of the finance articles must be J, G, and H. However, we still don't know the position of Y. So, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, and the order of the finance articles must be J, G, and H. This satisfies all the given conditions, so the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y, and the order of the finance articles must be H, G, and J. However, we don't know the position of R, so this choice does not fully determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, G, and R, and the order of the finance articles must be H, J, and Y. However, S must be earlier than Y, which contradicts this choice. So, this choice does not fully determine the order.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")

  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the position of the other articles.
  If H is fourth, we cannot determine the position of Q, R, and S.
  If H is sixth, we cannot determine the position of Q, R, and S.
  If R is fourth, we can determine the position of all articles except for Q and S.
  If R is seventh, we cannot determine the position of Q and S.
  If Y is fifth, we can determine the position of all articles.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in some order. But then the fourth article cannot be G, H, or J, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, in some order. The fourth article cannot be G, H, or J, so it must be Y. But then the fifth article cannot be S, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J. If the fourth article is R, then the fifth article must be Y, and the sixth article must be either G or J. The seventh article must be H. This order satisfies all the given conditions, so it fully determines the order.
  If R is seventh, then the sixth article must be G or J, and the fifth article must be Y. But then the fourth article cannot be Q, R, or S, so this does not fully determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, R, S, and some article that does not cover nutrition. But then the fifth article must be G, H, or J, which violates the given conditions, so this does not fully determine the order.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This satisfies all the conditions, and the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, which violates the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, which violates the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or later, which violates the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  Therefore, the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the mirror and vase are auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp could be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The only option that could be true is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Based on the above reasoning, the only statement that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the only possible order for the first three days is: June 1st - sundial, June 2nd - vase, June 3rd - mirror.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the only possible order for the last three days is: June 4th - harmonica, June 5th - table, June 6th - lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The only possible answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and vase must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but we don't know the order.
  The mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and vase must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but we don't know the order.
  The only option that could be true is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  Therefore, the only possible option is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then the harmonica would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on a later date than the table.
  The only remaining option is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, which satisfies the given condition. The sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the table could be auctioned on June 4th, and the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase, and the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used, so there must be at least three colors in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach must also be used in that rug.
  Using these rules, we can eliminate options A, B, and D.
  We cannot determine whether yellow is used in any of the rugs.
  However, since peach must be used in any rug that contains olive, and olive must be used in one of the rugs, we know that peach must be used in one of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in different rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in different rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in different rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used in that rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used in that rug.
  Statement A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement B is not necessarily true because turquoise can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement C is true because peach is used in a rug with olive.
  Statement D is not necessarily true because turquoise can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement E is not necessarily true because yellow may not be used in any of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, then they cannot be used together in a multicolored rug.
  If peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, then they cannot be used together in a multicolored rug.
  If peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, then they cannot be used together in a multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used in a solid-colored rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used. Therefore, olive cannot be used in a rug with only one color.
  From the given rules, we can conclude that:
    - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a multicolored rug.
    - Turquoise cannot be used in a solid-colored rug because it cannot be used with forest or peach.
    - Peach is used in one of the rugs because it is used with olive.
    - Yellow can be used in a solid-colored rug because it is not restricted by any of the rules.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")

  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used in separate rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used, which means that the rug is multicolored.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  The other statements are not necessarily true based on the given rules.

  We need to find a statement that must be true based on the given rules.
  If white is used, two other colors are also used. This means that any rug with white must be multicolored.
  If olive is used, peach is also used. This means that any rug with olive must be multicolored.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. This means that any rug with forest or turquoise must be solid.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. This means that any rug with peach or turquoise must be solid.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. This means that any rug with peach or yellow must be solid.
  Based on the above rules, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.

  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921, and Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  The only remaining year is 1924, which must be assigned to either Ryan, Tiffany, or Yoshio.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then either Ryan or Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  This means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922, because he must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be only five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, he cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be only five students available for the project, and each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany will be assigned to the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not allowed.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is not allowed.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which is not allowed.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.

Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the answer choices could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  We know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned, then any of the remaining five students could be assigned to any of the remaining three years.
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project - This could be true, as there are still four students available for the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project - This cannot be true, as if Ryan is not assigned, then Onyx cannot be assigned either.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project - This could be true, as there are still four students available for the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922 - This could be true, as long as Ryan is assigned to 1923 and Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924 - This cannot be true, as only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, and if Tiffany is not assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Louis is not assigned to the project or D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.

  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany are available for the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1924.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921 and Mollie must be assigned to 1924.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921 and Louis must be assigned to 1924.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1924 and Onyx can be assigned to either 1921 or 1923.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922 and Louis must be assigned to 1924. If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis must be assigned to 1924 and Onyx can be assigned to either 1921 or 1923.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921 and Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.

Response 9:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only 5 students available for the project.
  Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so he cannot be assigned to any of the years.
  Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany must be assigned to the four years.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This would mean that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is not possible since there are no years left. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. But if Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921. This leaves Ryan to be assigned to 1924, and Tiffany to be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.

  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or 0 must be first and the other must be second.
  N can be shown at any time.
  P can be shown at any time.
  Based on the rules, we can determine that the order must be: K, 0, L, M, N, P, J.
  The only answer choice that matches this order is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  If K is shown in the morning, then L must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  If L is shown in the morning, then K must be shown in the afternoon and M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be one of the following:
  1. K, L, M, N, 0, P, J
  2. L, K, M, N, 0, P, J
  The answer is either A or B.

  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or 0 must be the first or second house shown.
  N can be shown at any time.
  P can be shown at any time.
  Let's try to apply these rules to each answer choice:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
    K is shown first, so K cannot be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
    Therefore, this order is not possible.
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
    K is shown fourth, so K can be shown after L and M.
    This order is possible.
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
    K is shown third, so K cannot be shown before L and M.
    Therefore, this order is not possible.
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
    K is shown fifth, so K cannot be shown before L and M.
    Therefore, this order is not possible.
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
    K is shown third, so K can be shown after L and M.
    This order is possible.
  Therefore, the possible order is either B or E.

  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The order of the houses shown could be: K, L, M, N, 0, P, J.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or E because they do not follow the rules.
  The answer is D because it follows the rules and is a possible order of the houses shown.

Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third.
  If O is performed fifth, then F must be performed first, H must be performed second, and P must be performed third.
  Therefore, the possible accurate lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, are O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  If P is performed first, then the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  If P is performed second, then the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  If P is performed third, then the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first or second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed sixth or seventh.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If R is performed first, then F must be be performed sixth or seventh, and the two compositions between them must be performed second and third.
  If F is performed first, then R must be performed eighth, and the two compositions between them must be performed second and third.
  We also know that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If O is performed first, then S must be performed sixth or seventh, and the composition between them must be performed fifth.
  If O is performed fifth, then S must be performed second or third, and the composition between them must be performed fourth.
  Therefore, the possible compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first and O is performed first: O, P, R
  - If P is performed first and O is performed fifth: P, T, F
  - If P is performed second and O is performed first: O, P, T
  - If P is performed second and O is performed fifth: R, P, T
  - If P is performed third and O is performed first: O, T, F
  - If P is performed third and O is performed fifth: R, P, F
  The only option among the choices is C: O, P, R.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, the first composition, and either F or R.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth and T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If O is performed first, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, F, and R.
  If O is performed fifth, then the compositions that are performed before S are F, R, and O.
  From the given conditions, we also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, the composition that is not the eighth composition must be one of F, H, O, P, R, or T.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is F, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are O, R, and H, respectively.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is H, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are O, R, and F, respectively.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is O, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are F, R, and H, respectively.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is P, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are O, R, and T, respectively.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is R, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are F, O, and H, respectively.
  If the composition that is not the eighth composition is T, then the compositions that are performed first, second, and third are O, R, and P, respectively.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: F, H, P or D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be one of the following:
  1. O, F, R
  2. R, F, O
  3. O, R, F
  4. R, O, F
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, the possible orders of the first three compositions are:
  1. O, F, R, H/L, ?, ?, ?, S
  2. R, F, O, H/L, ?, ?, ?, S
  3. O, R, F, H/L, ?, ?, ?, S
  4. R, O, F, H/L, ?, ?, ?, S
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S, and at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, the possible orders of the first three compositions are further limited to:
  1. O, F, R, H/L, P, ?, ?, S
  2. R, F, O, H/L, P, ?, ?, S
  3. O, R, F, H/L, P, ?, ?, S
  4. R, O, F, H/L, P, ?, ?, S
  From the given choices, only D: O, P, T satisfies the possible orders of the first three compositions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed at some time before S.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third. But this violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth, and S must be performed after O. This means that P must be performed before O, and R must be performed after O.
  If F is performed before R, then H must be the eighth composition performed. But this violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, T must be performed immediately before F, and L must be the eighth composition performed.
  The only option that satisfies all these conditions is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either O, P, and R or F, H, and P.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed at some time before S.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second, and R must be performed third to satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. But this violates the condition that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, O cannot be performed first.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed either first or second, and R must be performed third to satisfy the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. But this violates the condition that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, O cannot be performed fifth.
  Therefore, the order of the first three compositions must be F, H, and P.
  The answer is A: F, H, P.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed first because P must be performed before S.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first and T must be performed second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed first and T must be performed sixth.
  We know that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If P is performed first, then H or L must be performed eighth.
  If P is performed second, then H or L must be performed eighth and the first composition performed must be either F or R.
  If P is performed third, then H or L must be performed eighth and the first composition performed must be either F or R.
  Therefore, the possible compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first, then the possible compositions are: O, H or L, S, P cannot be performed fourth, T, F, R, and one of H or L.
  - If P is performed second, then the possible compositions are: R or F, H or L, S, P, T, O, and one of H or L.
  - If P is performed third, then the possible compositions are: R or F, H or L, S, T, F or R, O, P, and one of H or L.
  The only option that matches one of the possible compositions is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first or second.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.

Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and either F or L. If O is performed fifth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F or L, H, and P.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, if L or H is not performed first, then it must be performed eighth.
  From the given conditions, we know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first. If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed first.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 79 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:
Thought:
  Bay 4 is not adjacent to the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, bay 4 is not holding produce or textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Therefore, bay 4 is not holding fuel.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, bay 4 is not holding livestock.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Therefore, bay 4 is not holding grain.
  The only option left is machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to determine which types of cargo can be held in each bay.
  Bay 6 must hold fuel because it is the only bay left that is higher than the bay holding produce.
  Bay 5 must hold produce because it is the only bay left that is lower than the bay holding fuel and next to the bay holding textiles.
  Bay 1 must hold textiles because it is the only bay left that is lower than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay 2 must hold livestock because it is the only bay left that is higher than the bay holding textiles and lower than the bay holding grain.
  Bay 3 must hold grain because it is the only bay left that is higher than the bay holding livestock and lower than the bay holding machinery.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4 is machinery.
  The answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that there are six types of cargo: fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, and textiles.
  We know that each bay is holding a different type of cargo.
  We know that bay 4 is holding one of the six types of cargo.
  We know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  We know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  We know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  We know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If bay 4 held grain, then bay 5 would have to hold livestock, and bay 6 would have to hold textiles. This would mean that bay 1 would have to hold produce, which is impossible because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, grain cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 held livestock, then bay 5 would have to hold textiles, and bay 6 would have to hold produce. This would mean that bay 1 would have to hold fuel, which is possible because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, livestock could be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 held machinery, then bay 3 would have to hold textiles, and bay 5 would have to hold livestock. This would mean that bay 6 would have to hold produce, which is possible because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, machinery could be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 held produce, then bay 3 would have to hold textiles, and bay 5 would have to hold livestock. This would mean that bay 6 would have to hold grain, which is impossible because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, produce cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  If bay 4 held textiles, then bay 3 would have to hold produce, and bay 5 would have to hold livestock. This would mean that bay 6 would have to hold grain, which is impossible because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, textiles cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  The only type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is produce.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is between bays 3 and 5.
  Textiles is next to produce, so textiles must be in either bay 3 or 5.
  Produce is in a higher-numbered bay than fuel, so produce must be in either bay 5 or 6.
  Therefore, textiles is in bay 3 and produce is in bay 5, or textiles is in bay 5 and produce is in bay 6.
  Bay 4 cannot hold livestock because livestock is in a higher-numbered bay than textiles.
  Bay 4 cannot hold grain because grain is in a higher-numbered bay than livestock.
  Bay 4 cannot hold produce because produce is in a higher-numbered bay than bay 4.
  Bay 4 cannot hold textiles because textiles is in either bay 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is machinery.

  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4 because Isaacs's oil is already displayed on wall 4.
  Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 1, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3 because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the lower position, then E is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on the remaining wall with Isaacs's watercolor.
  Since each wall has exactly two paintings, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in an upper position.
  The only statement that must be true is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the order of the businesses is as follows:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [shoe store], [?], [?], [?], [restaurant]
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  The restaurant must be at the other end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 1 or space 7.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the restaurant must be in space 7.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 4 or space 6.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements: optometrist can be on the left of the shoe store or on the right of the shoe store.
  If the optometrist is on the left of the shoe store, then the pharmacy must be on the right of the shoe store. This is because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 7, and the optometrist must be at space 6. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the two restaurants must be at spaces 2 and 4, and the veterinarian must be at space 3. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be at space 1. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the toy store and the pharmacy.
  If the optometrist is on the right of the shoe store, then the pharmacy must be on the left of the shoe store. This is because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the pharmacy must be at space 1, and the optometrist must be at space 2. Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the two restaurants must be at spaces 4 and 6, and the veterinarian must be at space 5. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be at space 7. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  In both cases, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist cannot be at either end of the row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be located between the pharmacy and the restaurant.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the optometrist and the shoe store must be located between the two restaurants.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be located at one end of the row, next to the optometrist.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store must be located next to the other restaurant.
  The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the restaurant.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.

  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements:
  1. Optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 1 or 3.
  2. Optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5 or 7.
  In both cases, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 and one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4 or space 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3 or space 6.
  So, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the shoe store must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 1 or space 3.
  If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3, and the pharmacy must be in space 2 or space 4.
  If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the veterinarian must be in space 3, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4, and the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 5.
  If the veterinarian is in space 3, then the toy store must be in space 4, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 5, and the toy store must be in space 4 or space 6.
  If the toy store is in space 4, then the two restaurants must be in spaces 5 and 7, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 6, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 5 and 7.
  The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.

  Therefore, the order of the businesses is either: pharmacy _ _ _ _ _ restaurant or restaurant _ _ _ _ _ pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the order of the businesses is restaurant _ _ _ _ _ pharmacy.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the order of the businesses is restaurant _ _ _ pharmacy _ _ _ or _ _ _ pharmacy _ _ _ restaurant.

Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.

  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on that day.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, which is Monday.
  Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
  The only option that satisfies all the conditions is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.

  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the choices:
  - A cannot be true because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday at the earliest.
  - B cannot be true because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  - C cannot be true because the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday at the earliest.
  - D cannot be true because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday or Thursday.
  This leaves us with only one possible answer:
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("E")

  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that the other two batches of cookies must have been made on Monday through Thursday.
  From the given conditions, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We also know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies and that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because that would mean the first batch of peanut butter cookies would also have to be made on Tuesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Similarly, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because that would mean the second batch of oatmeal cookies would also have to be made on Wednesday, which violates the condition that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because that would mean there would be no batches of cookies made on Friday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members.
  If Verma is the project leader, then only two workers can be project members.
  Therefore, the third worker must not be selected.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells can be a project member, which contradicts the condition that Verma cannot be the project leader if Wells is a project member.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Quinn can be a project member, which contradicts the condition that Quinn can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor must be a project member, which contradicts the condition that Verma cannot be the project leader if Taylor is a project member.
  If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith must be a project member, which satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
Verma can only be a project member if Wells is not selected.
If Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Ruiz cannot be a project member.
If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells cannot be a project member.
If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor must be a project member.
If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member.
Therefore, the only option that allows Verma to be the project leader is if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
Verma can be a project member only if Wells is not a project member.
If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
If Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member, and therefore Taylor must also be a project member.
Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells, Ruiz, and Quinn cannot be project members.
If Verma is the project leader, then Smith and Taylor must be project members.
Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Xue must be the third project member.
The answer is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.

  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then that person must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members.
  The only remaining workers are Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue.
  If Verma is the project leader, then exactly two of Smith, Taylor, and Xue must be project members.
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Taylor and Verma must be selected, which means that Wells cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
Verma can be a project member only if Wells is not a project member.
If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
If Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member, and therefore Taylor must also be a project member.
Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells, Ruiz, and Quinn cannot be project members, and Smith and Taylor must be project members.
Option A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which contradicts the constraint that Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member. Therefore, option A is not possible.
Option B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which contradicts the constraint that Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member. Therefore, option B is not possible.
Option C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which contradicts the constraint that Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member. Therefore, option C is not possible.
Option D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Smith can be a project member, but Taylor must also be a project member, which is not possible if only three workers are selected. Therefore, option D is not possible.
Option E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which contradicts the constraint that Smith must be a project member if Taylor is a project member. Therefore, option E is not possible.
The only possible option is A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
Verma can be a project member only if Wells is not selected.
If Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
Therefore, if Wells is selected, Verma cannot be the project leader.
If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be the project leader and the other two project members can be any of the remaining five workers.
Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("E")

Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown in the afternoon.
  C: L is shown in the evening.
  D: M is shown in the morning.
  E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Response 0:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  The first two houses are shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first house.
  Therefore, K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  L must be shown after K, so L cannot be the third house.
  Therefore, L must be the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  M must be shown after L, so M cannot be the fourth or fifth house.
  Therefore, M must be the sixth or seventh house.
  The sixth and seventh houses are shown in the evening, so J and M must be the sixth and seventh houses in some order.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon, and the answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon.
  L cannot be shown in the morning or evening.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  M must be shown after L.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the evening.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:

  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  From the rules, we can infer that K cannot be the first or second house to be shown in the morning. 
  Also, L cannot be the first or second house to be shown in the morning or the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the evening.
  The answer is C: L is shown in the evening.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:

  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown after K, so K cannot be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown before M, and M is shown in the morning.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  Since J is shown in the evening, L cannot be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  The last two houses are shown in the evening, so M cannot be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the morning.
  The answer is D: M is shown in the morning.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so J is the sixth or seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L is the fourth or fifth house.
  Therefore, the possible order of the houses is: 
  1st and 2nd: any of {J, K, L, M, N, O, P}
  3rd: any of {J, L, M, N, O, P}
  4th: any of {L, M, N, O, P} (but not J or K)
  5th: any of {L, M, N, O, P} (but not J, K, or the 4th house)
  6th: the remaining house from {J, K}
  7th: the remaining house from {J, K}
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon, and the answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, L is the fourth or fifth house to be shown.
  If L is the fourth house to be shown, then K is the third house to be shown and M is the fifth house to be shown.
  If L is the fifth house to be shown, then K is the third or fourth house to be shown and M is the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  Therefore, M can be shown in the afternoon or in the morning.
  A, B, and C are not necessarily true.
  D is not true because M cannot be shown in the morning if it is shown after L.

  Thus, Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: either no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, or one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Tuesday. This leaves only one batch of sugar cookies to be made on Thursday, and all three batches of each kind of cookie will have been made. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, and exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  We can also deduce that the third batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday and the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that each kind of cookie is made exactly three times a week, and each batch is made on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for the batches of cookies made on Tuesday and Friday.
  Scenario 1: Two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
    In this scenario, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Tuesday. This violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Scenario 2: One batch of cookies is made on Tuesday and two batches of cookies are made on Friday.
    In this scenario, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. This also means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies and three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, there are a total of 9 batches of cookies made each week.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios:
  Scenario 1: Two batches of cookies are made on Monday, two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, and three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Scenario 2: One batch of cookies is made on Monday, three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, and three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  In Scenario 1, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, B is true.
  In Scenario 2, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, A is true.
  Therefore, either A or B must be true.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday or Monday.
  In either case, there must be exactly three batches of cookies made on the day that the third batch of sugar cookies is made.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for Wednesday: no batches are made on Wednesday or one batch is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches made on Tuesday and one batch made on Friday.
  If one batch is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches made on either Tuesday or Friday.
  From the given options, the only choice that must be true is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.
  There are only three batches of each kind of cookie, so if two batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday and Thursday, then the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday or Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday, which means that there are no batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  We can now deduce that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies: Tuesday and Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not allowed. Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.
  Since the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, on Monday, there are only two batches of cookies made, which are oatmeal and peanut butter cookies.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person. Red team: Juana and Mei. (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person. Red team: Juana and Mei.
  In both configurations, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Olga is a facilitator, but we don't know which team Olga is assigned to.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well, and neither Juana nor Mei can be a facilitator. Therefore, D is false.
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga cannot be a facilitator, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, B is false.
  If Olga is assigned to the green team, then Lateefah cannot be a facilitator, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, C is false.
  If neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator, then Olga must be a facilitator on the green team, which means Juana must be on the red team, and Mei must be on the red team as well. Therefore, A is false.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one of Juana/Mei; Red team: Kelly and the other of Juana/Mei. (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one of Kelly/Juana/Mei; Red team: one of Kelly/Juana/Mei and the other of Juana/Mei/Kelly.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team. Lateefah is not a facilitator. Olga is assigned to the green team. Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. Kelly is not a facilitator.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned as a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team assignments: Green team with 3 members and Red team with 2 members OR Green team with 2 members and Red team with 3 members.
  If Juana is assigned to the green team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team. In this case, Olga is assigned to the green team with Lateefah and one of them is the facilitator. Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team and Olga is assigned to the green team with Mei. Olga is the facilitator of the green team.
  Juana and Mei are not both facilitators because only one member of each team is designated as a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to a team with two members, which means Juana is assigned to a team with three members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team and Olga is assigned to the green team.
  Mei is the only person left to assign to a team.
  There are no restrictions on Mei's assignment.
  Therefore, Mei could be a facilitator or not.
  The only statement that must be true is that Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person; Red team: Juana and Mei; or (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person; Red team: Juana, Mei, and one facilitator.
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team as well.
  If Juana and Mei are both assigned to the red team, then Olga must be assigned to the green team, which contradicts the fact that Olga is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the green team.
  If Juana is assigned to the green team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Mei, who is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so she must be assigned to the red team with Mei.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the green team with Lateefah and Olga, and Mei and Kelly are assigned to the red team.
  Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:

  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (facilitators: Lateefah and Olga) and red team (facilitator: Juana).
  Mei can be assigned to either team.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team, Olga is assigned to the green team, and Mei can be assigned to either team.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to the red team and is not a facilitator.

  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, the team with Lateefah must have three members and Olga must be on the other team with two members.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana must be on the team with three members and Olga must be on the team with two members.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Kelly cannot be on the team with two members.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei must be on the team with two members and one of them must be a facilitator.
  The only remaining person who has not been assigned a role is Kelly.
  Therefore, Kelly must be on the team with three members and Lateefah must be the facilitator for that team.
  So, Lateefah is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the red team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to the red team and is a facilitator.
  Mei is assigned to the red team and is not a facilitator.
  Kelly is assigned to the green team and is not a facilitator.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.

  Therefore, Trustcorp can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco can trade its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")

  Therefore, Southco must have traded its class 2 building with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it would still own a class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then RealProp would own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp would still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade for class 3 buildings, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it will no longer own any class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp can only trade class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building, it will receive two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 3 building, it will receive two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 3 building, it will still own a class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 1 building.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade its class 1 building for Trustcorp's two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco has not made any trades with Trustcorp.
  The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp.
  The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, none of the options are true.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:

  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 2 buildings, then Trustcorp still owns only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building or the Meyer Building, then RealProp must own the Garza Tower.
  If Trustcorp trades the Ortiz Building, then RealProp must own the Yates House or the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp will still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade is by trading one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 3 building for a class 2 building, Trustcorp will still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building.
  The only way Trustcorp can trade is by trading one of its class 1 buildings for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades its only class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, Trustcorp will own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade its only class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building, which is the Flores Tower.
  Therefore, Southco must trade the Flores Tower for Trustcorp's two class 2 buildings.
  After the trade, Southco will own only class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns only one class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower.
  RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings because it is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for another class 1 building.
  The only other class 1 building is the Flores Tower, which is owned by Southco.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower.
  After the trade, RealProp will own only class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:

  Therefore, Southco must make at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, it will still own at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for one building of the same class.
  Therefore, Southco must trade one of its class 2 buildings for one of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
  After the trade, Trustcorp will own only class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then one of the class 3 buildings must belong to RealProp or Southco.
  If Southco trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco will own only class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, Southco owns only class 3 buildings.
  The answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is possible.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp will own at least one class 3 building after the trade.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded one of its class 3 buildings for a class 2 building owned by Trustcorp.
  This means that Trustcorp owns at least one class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, it is not possible for Trustcorp to own no class 2 buildings after some number of trades.

  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two and Wellspring performs in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three or earlier.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one, two, or three.
  The only possible answer is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two, in some order.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the only possible order for slots one through six is: Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite, Yardsign, Uneasy.
  From this order, we can see that the only statement that could be true is that Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")

  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three or earlier.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one or slot two or slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four or slot five or slot six.
  Uneasy cannot perform in slot five because Wellspring and Zircon have already performed.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot six.
  The only option that meets all the constraints is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot one or two.
  If Wellspring performs in slot one, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring performs in slot two.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot three or later.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  If Vegemite performs in slot one, then Zircon must perform in slot three or later, which violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot two or three.
  If Vegemite performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot four or later, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Uneasy must perform in slot five or six, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.

  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the slots must be: 
  [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it must be in slot one or two.
  If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two, which violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot two.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Vegemite must perform in slot three.

### Temperature: 2.0 | Problem 100 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.

Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Choice A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
    If Siamese is featured on day 2, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2.
    If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on days 3, 4, and 5.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers must be featured on days 1, 2, and 6.
    However, this violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    Therefore, choice A is not true.
  Choice B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
    If Himalayans are featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers must be featured on days 1, 5, and 6.
    If Manx is featured on day 2, then Siamese must be featured on day 3 and Greyhounds must be featured on day 4.
    This satisfies all the conditions, so choice B could be true.
  Choice C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
    If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then they must be featured on days 2, 3, or 5.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 4.
    Therefore, choice C is not true.
  Choice D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on days 1, 2, and 6.
    If Himalayans are not featured on day 1, then they must be featured on days 2, 3, and 4.
    If Manx is featured on day 5, then Siamese must be featured on day 6 and Greyhounds must be featured on day 7.
    This satisfies all the conditions, so choice D could be true.
  Choice E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
    If Newfoundlands are featured on day 6, then they must be featured on days 3, 4, or 5.
    If Manx is featured on day 6, then Siamese must be featured on day 7 and Greyhounds must be featured on day 1.
    Therefore, choice E is not true.
  The only choice that could be true is B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the choices:
    - Choice A is not possible because Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so no breed can be featured on day 2.
    - Choice B is not possible because no breed featured on day 1 can be featured on day 7.
    - Choice C is not possible because Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans.
    - Choice D is not possible because Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5.

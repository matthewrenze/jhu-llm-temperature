### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation are Jiang and two other students who review Tamerlane.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation are Jiang, Kramer, and Lopez.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Lopez reviews fewer of the plays than Megregian, so Lopez cannot review two plays.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian must be the only one who reviews Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, neither Kramer nor O'Neill can review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill review Sunset.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian reviews Tamerlane.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer reviews Sunset too.
  Therefore, the following could be true:
    - Megregian does not review Undulation.
    - O'Neill does not review Undulation.
    - Jiang reviews Undulation.
    - Lopez does not review Tamerlane.
    - O'Neill reviews Sunset.
  The answer is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can be one of the three students who reviewed Undulation.
  Therefore, the three students who reviewed Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot have reviewed Undulation.
  Therefore, A and C are false.
  Since Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, E is false.
  Therefore, the only possible true statement is that Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, so the answer is D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, Jiang must review Tamerlane.
  We don't know anything about which play Lopez reviews, so it is possible that Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  O'Neill cannot review Sunset because only three students review Undulation and Tamerlane, and we already know that Jiang, Kramer, and Megregian review Undulation or Tamerlane.
  Therefore, O'Neill reviews Undulation.
  The only statement that could be true is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must have reviewed Undulation.
  If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then the remaining student, Lopez, must have reviewed Tamerlane, which contradicts the condition that exactly two students review the same play or plays.
  Therefore, Megregian did not review Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviewed Undulation, then he would have reviewed all three plays, which is not possible.
  Therefore, O'Neill did not review Undulation.
  Jiang reviewed Undulation, so A is false and C is true.
  The remaining student, Lopez, must have reviewed Tamerlane, so D is false.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be either Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then O'Neill must review Undulation, and Megregian and Lopez must review Tamerlane.
  The answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, then Jiang must review Undulation.
  The only remaining option is that Megregian and Lopez review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation, O'Neill does not review Undulation, Jiang reviews Undulation, and Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  The answer is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students do not review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, the student who reviews Undulation must be one of the following: Lopez, Megregian, or the student who reviews the same play or plays as Lopez or Megregian.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then neither Kramer nor Lopez can review Undulation, which means that the student who reviews the same play or plays as Lopez or Megregian must also review Undulation. This would make four students who review Undulation, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the two students who review the same play or plays as each other must review Undulation. This would make four students who review Undulation, which is not possible.
  Therefore, O'Neill reviews Undulation.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation, which means that the two students who review the same play or plays as each other must also review Undulation. This would make four students who review Undulation, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Jiang does not review Undulation.
  Lopez reviews fewer plays than Megregian, so Lopez cannot review Tamerlane, which means that Lopez cannot review the same play or plays as the student who reviews Tamerlane. Therefore, Lopez cannot review the same play or plays as any other student.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp has one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings is if two companies trade with one another.
  Therefore, either RealProp or Southco must trade with Trustcorp.
  If RealProp trades with Trustcorp, they must give away their class 1 building and receive two class 2 buildings.
  If Southco trades with Trustcorp, they must give away their class 1 or class 2 building and receive two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for Southco to trade the Lynch Building for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Flores Tower
  Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Lynch Building
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings, so they can only be traded for class 1 or class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower and the Lynch Building are class 1 and class 2 buildings respectively, so they can only be traded for class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are class 2 buildings, so they can only be traded for class 1 or class 3 buildings.
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible trade is RealProp's Garza Tower for Southco's Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building; Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  After only one trade, the number of buildings owned by each company must remain the same.
  The sum of the values of the buildings owned by each company must remain the same.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is by trading it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is by trading it for two class 3 buildings.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings, so they cannot be traded for a class 2 building.
  The only way to trade a class 3 building is by trading it for a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, or it can trade one of the class 3 buildings for a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco can trade the Flores Tower for two class 3 buildings, or it can trade the Lynch Building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one of the class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, or it can trade two of the class 2 buildings for a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made.
  Let's check each option:
    Option A: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and trades the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) for the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp trades the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building for the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). This option is not valid because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for a class 1 building.
    Option B: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Southco trades the Flores Tower (class 1) for the Garza Tower (class 1). Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building (class 2) for the Lynch Building (class 2). This option is valid.
    Option C: RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1). Southco trades the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3). Trustcorp trades the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building for the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). This option is not valid because Southco cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
    Option D: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Southco trades the Flores Tower (class 1) for the Garza Tower (class 1). Trustcorp trades the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3). This option is not valid because Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
    Option E: RealProp trades the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Southco trades the Garza Tower (class 1) for the King Building (class 2) and the Ortiz Building (class 2). Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3). This option is not valid because Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building; Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building; Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  There are three types of trades that can be made.
  After only one trade is made, each company can only have two buildings.
  A class 1 building can be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  A class 2 building can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only way to trade is to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  The Garza Tower and the Flores Tower are the only class 1 buildings.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are the only class 2 buildings.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are the only class 3 buildings.
  RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco must trade the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower.
  Trustcorp must trade two class 2 buildings for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, the only option that could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made is:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The only way to make a trade is by trading one building for one other building of the same class, trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only way to make a trade is to exchange a building for another building of the same class or exchange a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or exchange a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Based on the given options, the only possible trade is to exchange the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  RealProp has 2 class 3 buildings and 1 class 1 building.
  Southco has 1 class 1 building and 1 class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has 3 class 2 buildings.
  In order to make a trade, each company must trade one of their buildings with another company's building of the same class or with two buildings of the next lower class.
  Therefore, RealProp can only trade the Garza Tower with another class 1 building or with two class 2 buildings. RealProp can only trade the Yates House and the Zimmer House with another class 3 building or with two class 2 buildings.
  Southco can only trade the Flores Tower with another class 1 building or with two class 2 buildings. Southco can only trade the Lynch Building with another class 2 building or with two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building with another class 2 building or with two class 3 buildings.
  The only option that satisfies the trading rules is option E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find a combination of trades that results in each company owning buildings that meet the trade conditions.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp owns a class 1 building and Southco does not have a class 2 building to trade.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp owns a class 1 building and Trustcorp does not have two class 2 buildings to trade.
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for the Flores Tower (class 1) and Southco can trade the Lynch Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3). Trustcorp does not need to make any trades.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp owns a class 1 building and Trustcorp does not have two class 3 buildings to trade.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  One trade must be made.
  The possible trades are:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings. It can only trade the Garza Tower for another class 1 building or trade one of its class 3 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building. It can only trade the Flores Tower for another class 1 building or trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings. It can only trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  The only possible trade is RealProp trading the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower.
  Therefore, after one trade, the buildings owned by the three companies could be:
    RealProp: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
    Southco: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building
    Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns a class 1, a class 3, and another class 3 building.
  Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, the buildings exchanged must be of the same class or meet one of the other two trade requirements.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only way to trade a class 3 building is to trade it for another class 3 building.
  RealProp has two class 3 buildings, so it can trade one of them for another class 3 building.
  Southco has a class 1 building, so it can trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, so it can trade one of them for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, after one trade, RealProp will have one class 1, one class 3, and one class 3 building.
  Southco will have two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp will have two class 2 buildings, one class 3 building, and one class 3 building.
  The only answer choice that matches this configuration is E.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  Also, T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 5.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, which is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, which is possible.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, which is possible.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, which is not possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T can only be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 6, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 2, 4, 6, or 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 4, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 6, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  The only remaining clue is R, which must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 2, then X must be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  The order of clues is:
  Chapter 1: S
  Chapter 2: Z
  Chapter 3: U
  Chapter 4: T
  Chapter 5: X
  Chapter 6: R
  Chapter 7: W
  Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, or 5 because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4, which is not possible.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, so Z must be mentioned in chapter 5. Then, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and R must be mentioned in chapter 1. But this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and R must be mentioned in chapter 1. Then, S must be mentioned in chapter 4 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7. This satisfies all the constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 5, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, so it must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and it cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because that would mean W would have to be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier, which is not allowed. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if S is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, which means that Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later. If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, which means that Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later. If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, which means that Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later. If S is mentioned in chapter 4, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, which means that Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later. If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, which means that Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves R and S to be mentioned in chapters 1, 2, 5, and 6, and W to be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5, but we cannot be sure which one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, so X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3. This means that T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, and W must be mentioned in chapter 7 or earlier.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5, and X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5. This is because there are only two chapters between chapter 3 and chapter 5, and R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in either chapter 5 or 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  R can be mentioned in any chapter except chapter 3, since T must be mentioned before W.
  The only option that satisfies all of the constraints is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  U must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  W and X must not be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  R can be mentioned in any of the remaining chapters.
Action: Answer("D") 
The statement "W is mentioned in chapter 6" could be true if U is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 9:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  Since U is mentioned in chapter 3, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 2, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane since they either review fewer plays than Megregian or do not review any play reviewed by Jiang.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list.
  The list must have exactly two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the list must have only two students.
  The remaining students who are not part of the list must not review Tamerlane.
  Lopez and Megregian each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Lopez cannot be part of the list because Lopez must review fewer plays than Megregian who is already part of the list.
  Megregian can be part of the list if and only if Megregian is the second student who reviews the same play or plays as one of the students in the list.
  Jiang cannot be part of the list because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  The only possible list is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez or Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays and Kramer and Lopez each review one of the three plays.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Lopez or Megregian.
  If the third student is Lopez, then the list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, O'Neill, and Lopez.
  If the third student is Megregian, then the list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, O'Neill, and Megregian.
  Therefore, the possible list of students who review Tamerlane are:
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane because only two students can review the same play or plays as each other.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane since they do not review any other plays reviewed by Kramer or O'Neill.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez or Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the remaining two students who review Tamerlane must be among Lopez, Megregian, and the student who reviews the same play or plays as one of them.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays, and Kramer and Lopez must each review only one of the plays.
  Therefore, the student who reviews the same play or plays as one of Lopez or Megregian must review the remaining play.
  Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang can review Tamerlane because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez or Megregian review any play that Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays.
  Since exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, the list of students who review Tamerlane must have exactly two students.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.

  If the organizer selects one French play, then the organizer must select at least two French novels to satisfy the condition "At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected." This will satisfy the condition "No more than four French works are selected" since the organizer can select at most two French plays. The organizer can then select either one or two Russian novels to satisfy the condition "At least three but no more than four novels are selected." Therefore, the organizer must select at least five works consisting of one French play, two French novels, and one or two Russian novels.

    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.

  Therefore, it cannot be traded for two class 2 or two class 3 buildings.
  A: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, not RealProp.
  B: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, but the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so this cannot be true.

  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Hong must testify on Monday and Jackson must testify on Tuesday.
  If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Hong must testify on Tuesday and Jackson must testify on Monday.
  Therefore, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Franco cannot testify on Monday.
  Therefore, Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  Iturbe is also scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  Hong cannot testify on Tuesday because two witnesses must testify on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Hong is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  Garcia must testify on Tuesday.
  The answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then there would be three witnesses testifying on Tuesday (Hong, Iturbe, and Jackson), which is not allowed because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday.
  Garcia cannot testify on Monday because at least one witness testifies on Monday and Franco is already scheduled to testify on Monday. Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  The only day left for Jackson to testify is Tuesday.
  Therefore, the schedule is: 
  Monday: Franco
  Tuesday: Jackson, [Empty]
  Wednesday: Iturbe, Hong, Garcia
  The only choice that is true is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second and Trillo's audition must be third or fourth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be first, second, or third and Yoshida's audition must be fifth or sixth.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  Answer choice A is impossible because Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Answer choice E is impossible because Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Answer choice B is impossible because Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition must be recorded.
  Answer choice C is possible because it satisfies all the conditions.
  Answer choice D is impossible because the fourth audition cannot be recorded and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must go first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must go first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must go before Yoshida.
  Using the above conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  If Kammer goes first, then Lugo must go fourth, which means that the fifth audition cannot be recorded, which is a contradiction. Therefore, Kammer cannot go first.
  If Kammer goes second, then Trillo must go third, which means that Zinn must go first, and Yoshida must go last. Therefore, the order is Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida.
  The answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be third or earlier.
  Based on the above conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Choice A is not possible because it violates the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Choice C is not possible because it violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Choice E is not possible because it violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Therefore, the answer is either choice B or choice D.
  In choice B, Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  In choice D, Zinn's audition is first, which violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be the fifth audition.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
- From the above conditions, we can deduce that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.
- The only choice that matches this order is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  From the above conditions, we can deduce that Waite's audition must be first or second.
  If Waite's audition is first, then Kammer's audition must be second, and either Lugo's or Trillo's audition must be fourth.
  If Kammer's audition is fourth, then Lugo's audition must be fifth, and Trillo's audition must be sixth.
  If Lugo's audition is fourth, then Trillo's audition must be fifth, and Kammer's audition must be sixth.
  If Waite's audition is second, then Kammer's audition must be third, and either Lugo's or Trillo's audition must be fourth.
  If Kammer's audition is fourth, then Lugo's audition must be fifth, and Trillo's audition must be sixth.
  If Lugo's audition is fourth, then Trillo's audition must be fifth, and Kammer's audition must be sixth.
  The order of the auditions can be determined as follows:
  Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Zinn, Yoshida
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We know that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Waite's, Trillo's, Zinn's, or Yoshida's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Waite's, Trillo's, Zinn's, or Yoshida's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices:
  - A: Kammer's audition cannot be first because Waite's audition must be earlier than the two recorded auditions. Trillo's audition cannot be third because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - C: Lugo's audition cannot be second because Waite's audition must be earlier than the two recorded auditions. Trillo's audition cannot be fourth because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - E: Kammer's audition cannot be last because the fifth audition must be recorded.
  We are left with answer choices B and D. 
  In answer choice B, Waite's audition is first, Kammer's audition is second, and Zinn's audition is fourth. This satisfies all the conditions, so it could be the correct answer.
  In answer choice D, Waite's audition is first, Zinn's audition is second, and Kammer's audition is third. This violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so it cannot be the correct answer.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the first three auditions.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either the fifth or the sixth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first or the second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or the second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third or the fourth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first or the second audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or the sixth audition.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - In choice A, Kammer's audition is followed by Trillo's audition, which violates the condition that Trillo's audition must be after Kammer's audition.
  - In choice B, Waite's audition is followed by Yoshida's audition, which violates the condition that Yoshida's audition must be after Zinn's audition.
  - In choice C, Lugo's audition is followed by Kammer's audition, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's audition.
  - In choice E, Zinn's audition is followed by Yoshida's audition, which violates the condition that Yoshida's audition must be after Zinn's audition.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Therefore, the fifth audition must be either Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Therefore, Waite's audition must be the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, Kammer's audition must be the first or second audition, and Zinn's audition must be the third or fourth audition.
  Yoshida's audition must be the last audition.
  Therefore, Trillo's audition must be the fourth audition.
  The possible orders of the auditions are:
    1. Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Zinn, Trillo, Yoshida
    2. Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Zinn, Yoshida, Trillo
    3. Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Yoshida
    4. Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
    5. Zinn, Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida
  Therefore, the answer is E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. So, Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. So, Kammer's audition must be first or second and Trillo's audition must be fourth, fifth or sixth.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. So, Trillo's audition cannot be fourth.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. So, Trillo's audition must be sixth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. So, Zinn's audition must be third and Yoshida's audition must be last.
  Therefore, the order of the auditions from first to last is: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.
  The answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third, fourth, or fifth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition, and Yoshida's audition must be the sixth and last audition.
  Based on these conditions, the only possible order is: Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.

Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  To form a team of at least four employees, we need to find a pair of employees who are required to be on the team.
  Ortega and Wong cannot be on the team together because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Paine and Schmidt cannot be on the team together because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  Thomson and Yoder cannot be on the team together because there is no constraint between them.
  Yoder and Zayre cannot be on the team together because there is no constraint between them.
  Ortega and Schmidt can be on the team together because there is no constraint between them, and at least one of them must be on the team.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Ortega and Schmidt.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees who must be on the team.
  Wong must be on the team, so Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  Therefore, the pair of employees who must be on the team is Myers and Yoder.
  The answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
To answer this question, we need to find a pair of employees who must be on the team. We can use the given conditions to eliminate some options. 
- If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is selected. 
- If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So, if Schmidt is selected, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
- If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, if Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
- We need to find a pair of employees who must be on the team. 

Option A: Ortega and Schmidt - Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is selected. So, this option is not correct.
Option B: Ortega and Wong - If Wong is selected, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. So, this option is not correct.
Option C: Paine and Schmidt - If Schmidt is selected, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. So, this option is not correct.
Option D: Thomson and Yoder - This option does not have any conditions. So, this could be the correct answer.
Option E: Yoder and Zayre - This option does not have any conditions. So, this could be the correct answer.

Both options D and E do not have any conditions. However, we need to select the option that has a pair of employees who must be on the team. Therefore, the answer is D: Thomson and Yoder. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  Myers must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  Thomson and Yoder are not related to any of the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Ortega and Wong or E: Yoder and Zayre.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team must include at least four employees.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  We can eliminate Yoder and Zayre because there is no information that suggests they must be on the team.
  We can eliminate Ortega because if Myers is on the team, Ortega cannot be on the team.
  We can eliminate Paine because if Myers is not on the team, Paine can be on the team, but it is not a requirement.
  We can eliminate Schmidt because if Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, but it is not a requirement.
  That leaves us with Wong, Myers, Thomson, and Zayre.
  Wong must be on the team, and if Wong is on the team, Myers must also be on the team.
  Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team, but Schmidt is not required to be on the team.
  Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Myers and Wong.
  The answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, we can have Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, we can have Wong, Myers, and Yoder on the team together.
  Therefore, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Yoder and Myers.
  The answer is not A, B, C, or D.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  We can eliminate options (A), (C), (D), and (E) because neither employee in each pair is required to be on the team.
  Ortega cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team, so Wong and Yoder must be on the team. Therefore, the answer is (B) Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Therefore, Ortega, Paine, and Wong cannot be on the team together.
  Thomson must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  Myers and Yoder must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  Therefore, the only possible pairs are:
  - Paine and Thomson
  - Thomson and Yoder
  - Myers and Yoder
  - Myers and Thomson
  - Schmidt and Paine
  - Schmidt and Thomson
  None of the pairs include Ortega or Wong.
  Therefore, the answer is not B.
  The only pair that includes Schmidt is C.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Paine and Schmidt. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to identify a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  Paine must be on the team if Schmidt is on the team.
  Myers must be on the team if Wong is on the team.
  Thomson and Yoder are not related to any other employee.
  Therefore, the pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Ortega and Wong.
  The answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  To answer this question, we need to identify pairs of employees that must be on the team based on the given constraints.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, if Ortega or Paine is on the team, Myers cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, if Paine or Thomson is not on the team, Schmidt cannot be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, if Myers or Yoder is not on the team, Wong cannot be on the team.
  Based on these constraints, the only pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team is Yoder and Myers.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.
  Choice A violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Choice B violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Choice C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Choice D satisfies all the rules and is a valid assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  #1: Robertson; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Souza; #5: Togowa; #6: Vaughn
  Therefore, the answer is C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #1 and #2 for Souza and Togowa, but we don't know which one gets which.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #1 and #2 for Togowa and Souza, but we don't know which one gets which.
  Therefore, both (C) and (D) could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  #1: Robertson; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Souza; #5: Togowa; #6: Vaughn
  The answer is not A, B, C, or E.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.

Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Mollie is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must also be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie could be assigned to 1921, and Yoshio could be assigned to 1922.
  The other years would then be assigned as follows: Tiffany to 1923, Ryan to 1924, and Louis to none of the years.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mollie is assigned to 1921. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:

  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Mollie is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Yoshio is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. 
  Therefore, Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1924, and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then she cannot be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is Mollie to 1922, Ryan to 1923, Onyx to 1922, and Yoshio to 1924.

  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project.
  The only possible assignment is Yoshio to 1922 and Mollie to 1921.
  Therefore, Yoshio could be assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")

  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But Onyx is already assigned to 1922, so Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. But Tiffany is already assigned to the project, so Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio is the only student left, so he must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Louis is assigned to 1923.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca cannot lead Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she will lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia will lead Wednesday morning and Friday morning sessions, respectively.
  So, we know the lab assistants for Wednesday morning, Thursday afternoon, Friday morning, and Friday afternoon sessions.
  We do not know the lab assistants for Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning sessions.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistants for four sessions.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead any session on Thursday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday afternoon, and Olivia's session must be on Friday morning.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistants' sessions as follows:
  Wednesday morning: 
  Thursday morning: 
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Olivia
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin, Rebecca
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for Lan and Nessa.
  The answer is C: three.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, but we don't know which day that is.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon session.
  Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia, so Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session.
  That leaves Kevin and Rebecca to lead the Thursday morning and Friday morning sessions, but we don't know which one leads which.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by 4 lab assistants: Julio, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  Nessa's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  There are only two remaining sessions, one on Wednesday and one on Friday.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for the Wednesday and Friday sessions.
  The answer is B: two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning or Friday morning.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon sessions, or the Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon sessions, or the Friday morning and Friday afternoon sessions.
  There are three possible scenarios:
    1. Kevin and Rebecca lead the Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon sessions.
       Therefore, Lan must lead the Thursday morning session and Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
       Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
       Therefore, for this scenario, we know which session each lab assistant leads.
    2. Kevin and Rebecca lead the Thursday morning and Thursday afternoon sessions.
       Therefore, Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
       Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
       Therefore, for this scenario, we know which session each lab assistant leads.
    3. Kevin and Rebecca lead the Friday morning and Friday afternoon sessions.
       Therefore, Julio must lead the Wednesday morning session and Lan must lead the Thursday morning session.
       Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
       Therefore, for this scenario, we know which session each lab assistant leads.
  In all three scenarios, we know which session each lab assistant leads except for one lab assistant.
  Therefore, the answer is A: one. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  If Julio's session is on Wednesday, then Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  If Julio's session is on Thursday, then Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for Kevin and Rebecca (Wednesday or Friday), Nessa (Thursday afternoon), and Julio (Thursday afternoon).
  We cannot determine the sessions for Lan and Olivia.
  Therefore, the answer is C: three.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead a session on either Wednesday or Friday.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  Therefore, the lab assistant assignments are as follows:
  Wednesday morning: Lan or Nessa
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  Thursday morning: One of the assistants who has not yet been assigned to a Thursday session
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Olivia
  Friday afternoon: One of the assistants who has not yet been assigned to a Friday session
  Therefore, for three of the other lab assistants (Lan or Nessa, Kevin or Rebecca, and Olivia), one can determine which sessions they lead. The other three assistants could be assigned to either of the remaining sessions.
  The answer is C: three.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday and Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  Lan cannot lead the Thursday morning session, so she must lead the Friday morning session.
  Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for each session as follows:
  Wednesday morning: Kevin
  Wednesday afternoon: Rebecca
  Thursday morning: Lan
  Thursday afternoon: Nessa
  Friday morning: Olivia
  Friday afternoon: Julio
  We can determine the lab assistant for all sessions except for the Friday morning session.
  Therefore, the answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead a session on Wednesday and the other on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Thursday morning.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for all sessions except for the Wednesday afternoon session.
  The lab assistant for the Wednesday afternoon session could be either Lan or Olivia.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for 5 out of 6 sessions.
  The answer is E: five.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead either the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be either the Wednesday or Thursday session.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then the assignments of the lab assistants to sessions can be determined as follows:
  Wednesday morning: one of Lan, Olivia, Kevin, or Rebecca
  Wednesday afternoon: one of Lan, Olivia, Kevin, or Rebecca
  Thursday morning: one of Lan, Olivia, Kevin, or Rebecca
  Friday morning: one of Lan, Olivia, Kevin, or Rebecca

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  A cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then that wall will have only the works of two students, namely Franz and Greene, which violates the second condition.
  B cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then that wall will have only the works of two students, namely Franz and Hidalgo, which violates the second condition.
  C can be true because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil could be displayed in the upper position of another wall.
  D can be true because there is no condition that forbids Hidalgo's watercolor to be displayed in a lower position.
  E cannot be true because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, the answer is E.

Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that Franz's oil is displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, because that would mean that wall 4 has both Isaacs's oil and Hidalgo's oil displayed on it, which would violate the rule that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students, which is not allowed.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students, which is not allowed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position, then the wall will have only watercolors in the lower position, which is not allowed.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then the wall will have only oils in the upper position, which is not allowed.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then the wall will have only the work of two students, which is not allowed.

Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday?
Choices:
  A: George and Lenore
  B: Helen and Nina
  C: Irving and Robert

  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there are no restrictions on the reports given on the next day.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  The only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Irving.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Helen and Nina.

  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  We can use the contrapositive of the statement about Nina to help us determine which pairs of students must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Helen and Irving do not give reports on the day after Nina's report, then Nina did not give a report or her report was on Wednesday.
  If Nina did not give a report, then it does not matter which day the other students give their reports.
  If Nina's report was on Wednesday, then the only students left to give reports are George, Lenore, and Kyle.
  George cannot give a report on Monday, so he must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina's report was on Wednesday, then George and one other student must give reports on Wednesday.
  The only pair of students left who have not been accounted for are Helen and Irving.
  Therefore, if Helen and Irving give reports on the same day as each other, then they must give reports on Wednesday.
  The answer is B: Helen and Nina.

  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Monday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on either Monday or Wednesday.
  George cannot give a report on Monday, so he must give a report on Tuesday.
  Therefore, George cannot be part of the pair that must give reports on Wednesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give reports in the morning.
  Therefore, Olivia and Robert cannot be part of the pair that must give reports on Wednesday.
  Kyle cannot be part of the pair that must give reports on Wednesday because he has not been mentioned in any of the conditions.
  Therefore, the only possible pair that must give reports on Wednesday is Helen and Irving.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be second and Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be third and fourth, in some order.
  From the above, we can conclude that Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture because it must be earlier than the watercolors lecture which is already third.
  Therefore, we can eliminate option B.
  Farley gives the watercolors lecture cannot be true because we know that the watercolors lecture is third and Farley's lecture must be first.
  Therefore, we can eliminate option A.
  Garcia gives the sculptures lecture and Holden gives the sculptures lecture cannot both be true because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  Therefore, we can eliminate option C and D.
  From the above, we can conclude that Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the sculptures lecture.
  If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the oil paintings and watercolors lectures, but it is not clear which order they are in.
  Therefore, (D) Holden gives the sculptures lecture is the only possible answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either O-W-L-S or W-O-L-S.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know the order.
  If the order is W-O-L-S, then Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, which is not possible since the watercolors lecture is third.
  If the order is O-W-L-S, then Garcia gives the sculptures lecture and Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the first or the second lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  Since Holden's lecture is the first lecture, Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be either the second or the third lecture.
  If Garcia's lecture is the second lecture, then Farley's lecture must be the first lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the fourth lecture, which means that Garcia's lecture must be the sculptures lecture, but this contradicts the fact that Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia's lecture must be the third lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the second lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be the first lecture and Holden's lecture must be the fourth lecture.
  The only remaining lecture is the oil paintings lecture, which must be the second lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  The answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  Therefore, the order of the lectures must be either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, Garcia and Jiang must give the second and fourth lectures, but we don't know the order.
  If the order is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, then Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, and Farley gives the sculptures lecture. This means that Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the order must be sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Farley gives the sculptures lecture, and Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden must give the first lecture, so he gives the sculptures lecture.
  Jiang must give the last lecture, so he gives the lithographs lecture.
  The only remaining lecture is the watercolors lecture, which means that Holden gives the watercolors lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first or the second lecture.
  If Holden's lecture is the first, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be the second and the fourth, but this would violate the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture is the second.
  If Garcia's lecture is the third, then Farley's lecture must be the first and Jiang's lecture must be the fourth, but this would violate the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia's lecture is the fourth.
  If Farley's lecture is the third, then Garcia's lecture must be the fourth, but this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture is the first.
  This means that Holden's lecture is the second, Garcia's lecture is the fourth, and Jiang's lecture is the third.
  The only choice that could be true is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third, so the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  If the order is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, then Garcia's lecture must be the fourth lecture, and Jiang's lecture must be the second lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture. 
  If the order is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, then Farley's lecture must be the first lecture, and Garcia's lecture must be the second lecture. Therefore, Garcia could give the oil paintings lecture.
  If the order is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs, then Jiang's lecture must be the fourth lecture. Therefore, Jiang cannot give the lithographs lecture.
  If the order is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, then Jiang's lecture must be the second lecture. Therefore, Jiang could give the lithographs lecture.
  If the order is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, then Holden's lecture must be the first lecture. Therefore, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  If the order is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs, then Farley's lecture must be the second lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  Therefore, the only possible true statement is that Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We are given that the watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be the last lecture.
  Since the watercolors lecture is third, the oil paintings lecture must be second.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Since Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, Holden's lecture must be the sculptures lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia's lecture must be the last lecture, which is the lithographs lecture.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays
  D: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  At least two photographers must be assigned to each of the two graduation ceremonies.
  Based on the constraints, we can try to create a valid assignment.
  From constraint 1, we know that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together.
  From constraint 2, we know that if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. So, Knutson must be assigned to Thorne University.
  From constraint 3, we know that if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University. So, Gonzalez must be assigned to Silva University and Lai must be assigned to Thorne University.
  From constraint 4, we know that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, they must be assigned to different ceremonies. So, Mays must be assigned to Silva University.
  We have now assigned Frost, Heideck, Gonzalez, Lai, Knutson, and Mays. All photographers are assigned, and each ceremony has at least two photographers assigned to it. Therefore, the answer is C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected as well.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If F is selected, then K cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Let's evaluate each choice:
    A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. If K is selected, then F cannot be selected, but there is no restriction on selecting G.
    B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. There is no restriction on selecting both L and F.
    C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true. We can select any one of the chemists.
    D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true. We can select both F and any one of the chemists.
    E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is true. If exactly two chemists are selected, then we can select any two of the chemists except K and M. If we select K and M, then we must select both P and R. Therefore, we cannot select G in this case.
  Therefore, the answer is E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 1:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F and G can both be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then the two selected chemists can be any two of K, L, and M.
  Therefore, (A) and (E) are not necessarily true.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected, so (B) is not necessarily true.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M, so (C) is not necessarily true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F can be selected, so (D) is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is (D).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then R must also be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then G cannot be selected.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we know that the other two types of scientists must be represented by at least one person each.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, we know that at most one botanist is selected.
  If F and K cannot both be selected, then if K is selected, F cannot be selected.
  If K and M cannot both be selected, then if M is selected, K cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, we know that M is not selected.
  Therefore, K is not selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected. If F is selected, then G can also be selected.
  Therefore, A, C, and D are not necessarily true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F and G must be selected.
  Therefore, E is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be selected.
  There are three botanists, and if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, only one botanist can be selected, and the other two types of scientists must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  If K is selected, then L and M cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then K cannot be selected, because if K is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If K is not selected, then F and G can both be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then A must be true and B, C, D, and E may or may not be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K because K is the only chemist that is a possible candidate with P.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then K and L or L and M must be selected. 
  If K and L are selected, then F and G cannot both be selected. 
  If L and M are selected, then F can still be selected.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we must select at least one botanist and one chemist.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, we can have only one botanist and one zoologist selected if M is not selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then G cannot be selected.
  Therefore, A and B are not true.
  We can have exactly one chemist selected if M is not selected.
  Therefore, C is not true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then we must select L and either K or M.
  If M is not selected, then we can select F as the botanist.
  Therefore, D is not true.
  If M is selected, then we cannot select G as the botanist.
  Therefore, E is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, at most one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since only P is selected, M cannot be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, F cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. If L is selected, then G cannot be selected. 
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist on the panel.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, at most one botanist is selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, M cannot be selected since only one zoologist can be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Therefore, A is true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q or R is selected, then at least one botanist must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then K can be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then K cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.

Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2 and Parra works in Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Parra works in Zone 3.
  In any case, Stuckey is not in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find a sales representative who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1. But Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, which means Quinn cannot work in Zone 1. 
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then either Tiao or Udall also works in Zone 2. But either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao or Udall, which means Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall also work in Zone 3. But Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall, which means Quinn cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. 
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if we can find the sales representative that cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, then that will be the answer.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, if Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2. If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must also work in Zone 2. If Stuckey works in Zone 1 or Zone 3, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, since we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, they cannot both work in Zone 2. Therefore, at most one of them works in Zone 2.
  If we assume that Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 3, then there would be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. In this case, Quinn would work in the same sales zone as Stuckey and Udall, but not with Kim or Mahr. Therefore, the answer is A: Kim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Also, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, if Quinn works in the same sales zone as either Parra or Stuckey, then the other sales representative in the pair will also be in that sales zone.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Udall must work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  In any case, Quinn can work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, or Tiao.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, Quinn is in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, Udall is in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Stuckey is in Zone 3, Udall is in Zone 3.
  If there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, if Parra and Quinn are in Zone 1, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then Udall is in Zone 3, and there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao must be in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey or Udall.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, Stuckey, or Udall.

Thought:
  We need to find the sales representative that Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Also, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Parra or Stuckey or Udall.
  Tiao is already assigned to Zone 2, so Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
Action: Answer("E")

  We need to determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Parra, Stuckey, or Udall.
  Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in relation to Quinn, Parra, Stuckey, or Udall, so they could potentially work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Tiao is mentioned in relation to Parra and Udall, but not in relation to Quinn, so Tiao could potentially work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  The answer is either A: Kim, B: Mahr, or D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao work in Zone 3.
  The remaining sales representative, which is Parra, works in Zone 1.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra.
  The answer is A: Kim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which sales representative cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must also work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  This means that there are four sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra, Quinn, Udall, and Stuckey) and two sales representatives in Zone 1 (Kim and the remaining sales representative) and one sales representative in Zone 2 (Tiao).
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim cannot work in Zone 1 because there can only be one sales representative in Zone 1 in addition to Parra or Tiao.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as A: Kim.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), (unknown), Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth, because in both cases, he would be immediately before or after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be Stanton, Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Stanton, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), Villas, White.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), (unknown), Villas, Stanton, White.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited first, second, third, fifth, or seventh.
  The answer is E: seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining five.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the accomplices is Quinn, Rovero, Peters, and the remaining four.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of the accomplices is Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White, and the remaining two.
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited either third, fifth, or seventh.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is: 
  1. Peters
  2. Quinn
  3. Rovero
  4. ?
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White
  Stanton cannot be recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order is:
  1. Quinn
  2. Rovero
  3. Tao
  4. Peters
  5. ?
  6. Villas
  7. White
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order is:
  1. Quinn
  2. Rovero
  3. Stanton
  4. Tao
  5. Peters
  6. Villas
  7. White
  Therefore, Stanton can be recruited third.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: (1) Peters, (2) Tao, (3) Villas, (4) White, (5) Quinn, (6) Rovero, and (7) Stanton.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth or seventh.
  The only answer choice that matches this is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is: 
  [?, ?, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. 
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?].
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [Stanton, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?].
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  [Stanton, Tao, Quinn, Rovero, Peters, Villas, White].
  Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited third, fourth, fifth, or seventh. 
  The only option left is that Stanton was recruited first.
  Therefore, the answer is A: first.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao would have to be recruited second, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao would have to be recruited first, which is not possible.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then Tao would have to be recruited sixth, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited fourth or sixth.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fifth and Rovero must have been recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, third, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao must have been recruited second and Quinn must have been recruited third, which contradicts the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao must have been recruited first, which contradicts the given information that Stanton was not recruited immediately before Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then Tao must have been recruited first and Quinn must have been recruited second, which satisfies the given information that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton must have been recruited third.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited in the first three positions and Rovero in the next three positions.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters cannot be Quinn or Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be Quinn or Rovero.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment for Quinn, Rovero, and Stanton is: 
    1. Quinn, Rovero, Stanton
    2. Rovero, Quinn, Stanton
    3. Quinn, Stanton, Rovero
    4. Stanton, Quinn, Rovero
    5. Rovero, Stanton, Quinn
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the possible order of recruitment is:
    1. Quinn, Rovero, Stanton
    2. Stanton, Quinn, Rovero
    3. Rovero, Stanton, Quinn
  In all possible orders, Stanton was recruited either immediately before or immediately after Quinn.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first or third.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  Peters -> Tao -> Stanton -> Quinn -> Rovero -> Villas -> White
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is either A: first, B: second, or E: seventh.
  However, we cannot determine the exact position of Stanton based on the given information.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fifth and Rovero sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the order of the recruits so far is Peters, [blank], [blank], [blank], Quinn, Rovero, [blank].
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited first, second, third, or fifth, then he could have been recruited either immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited fourth.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor

  If the bay holding livestock is in bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 4 and the bay holding textiles must be in bay 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 5 and the bay holding textiles must be in bay 3.
  Therefore, bay 4 cannot be holding produce if the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
  Choice B is not true.
  All other choices could be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock is either 3 or 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either 3 or 5.
  If the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, then the bay holding produce is either 5 or 6.
  If the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock is either 3 or 4 and the bay holding grain is either 1 or 2.
  If the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, then the bay holding livestock is 3 and the bay holding textiles is 5.
  Therefore, Bay 4 cannot be holding produce because it is next to the bay holding livestock which is Bay 3.
  The answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce.

  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 and the romance must be shown on screen 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1 and the romance must be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the romance could be shown on screen 1.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the western must begin at 7 P.M.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the western must begin at 9 P.M.

  Therefore, the answer is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the only possible screen for the western and the sci-fi film to be shown together is screen 1.
  If the western begins before the sci-fi film, then the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 and the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 because the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 2.
  The only remaining movie to be shown is the romance, which must be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the horror film is shown on screen 2 and begins at 9 P.M.
  The answer is A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screens 1 and 2.
  The western begins before the horror film, so it must be shown at 7 P.M.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown at 7 P.M., so it must be shown at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the horror film is shown on screen 1 and the mystery is shown on screen 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the romance is shown at 8 P.M.
  The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  The western begins at 7 P.M.
  The sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M.
  The horror film is shown on screen 1.
  The romance is shown on screen 3.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the bottom shelf and L must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so L cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the top shelf and O must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  From the condition "F is placed on the same shelf as M", we know that F and M must be on the same shelf, which is the shelf that is different from the shelf that I is on.
  Therefore, M must be on the top shelf and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  Since G is the only book left, G must be on the same shelf as H.
  Therefore, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the top shelf, and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If L is placed on the middle shelf, then O must be placed on the top shelf, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and O must be placed on the middle shelf.
  G can be placed on any shelf as long as it is not on the same shelf as F or M.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the bottom shelf and L must be placed on either the top or middle shelf.
  From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on the top shelf, then O must be placed on the top shelf as well, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, L must be placed on the middle shelf and O must be placed on the top shelf.
  From the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M, we know that F and M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we know that K must be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, G and H must be placed on the middle shelf, and the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so L cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf.
  If L is on the bottom shelf, then O must be on the top or middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, O must be on the top shelf.
  If O is on the top shelf, then K must be on the middle shelf, and F must be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is on the middle shelf, and F is on the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the bottom shelf, then M must be on the same shelf as F.
  Therefore, M is on the bottom shelf.
  If H is on the top shelf, then G must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, H must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then F and K must be placed on the top shelf and bottom shelf, respectively.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then M must also be placed on the top shelf.
  Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  The only answer choice that can be deduced from this arrangement is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the bottom shelf and L must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as K.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as O.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If L is placed on the middle shelf, then O must be placed on the top shelf and K must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  If L is placed on the bottom shelf, then O must be placed on the top shelf and K can be placed on either the middle or bottom shelf.
  In either case, G cannot be placed on the same shelf as H.
  Therefore, the answer is D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then F and L cannot be placed on the same shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then K and L cannot be placed on the same shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, K and O are not placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The only answer choice that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so H must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf as I.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K and F must be on different shelves than I.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O and L must be on different shelves than I.
  If H is placed on the top shelf, then L must be placed on the middle or top shelf, which means O must be placed on the bottom shelf, and K must be placed on the middle shelf. This would mean that G and F are placed on the same shelf, so A would be true.
  If H is placed on the middle shelf, then L must be placed on the top shelf, which means O must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf, and K must be placed on the top shelf. This would mean that H and M are placed on the same shelf, so C would be true.
  Therefore, either A or C must be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the bottom shelf and L must be placed on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F, G, and M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the top or middle shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so L cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is on the top shelf, then O must also be on the top shelf, which contradicts the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the top or bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, G and H must be on the middle shelf, and H and M must be on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then there must be at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist in the panel.
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected.
  If K is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so either P or R must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, the panel must include either F or else M.
  The answer is B: F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then the panel must include one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else M.
  The answer is B: F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist.
  If the panel includes F, then the panel can include at most one zoologist. Therefore, if F is selected, then P and R cannot both be selected.
  If the panel includes K, then M cannot be selected. Therefore, if K is selected, then M is not selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or K.
  The answer is A: F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that neither F nor K can be selected, since F and K cannot both be selected.
  We also know that if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If both G and H are selected, then we need at least one botanist and one zoologist to be selected.
  If we select F as the botanist, then we cannot select any zoologist, since if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, we must select H as the botanist.
  If we select K as the chemist, then we cannot select M, since K and M cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, we must select L as the chemist.
  This leaves us with the three zoologists, P, Q, and R.
  If we select Q as the zoologist, then we have a panel consisting of H, L, and Q.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include Q as the zoologist.
  The answer is E: P or else Q.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist.
  If the panel includes F, then the panel can include at most one zoologist.
  If the panel includes K, then it cannot include F.
  If the panel includes M, then it must include both P and R.
  Therefore, the panel must include F or K or M.
  The answer is A or B or C.
Action: Answer("A or B or C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then we know that the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then we must select K or M to satisfy the condition of having at least one botanist.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. If M is selected, then P and R must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means either P or Q can be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If F is not selected, then K must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or K.
  The answer is A: F or else K.

Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall

  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one of Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, both Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  This means that there are four sales representatives working in Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall, Parra, and Quinn.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  From the given options, only option D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall, has Tiao working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 3.
  Also, Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra and Tiao must work in different zones.
  From the given options, only option E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall, has Parra and Quinn working in the same zone.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone as each other, and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must also work in Zone 3.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the other one (either Tiao or Parra) must work in Zone 3.
  We have two sales representatives left: Kim and Mahr.
  Neither of them has been assigned to a sales zone yet.
  Therefore, they must work in Zone 2 along with Tiao or Parra.
  The only answer choice that includes Stuckey, Udall, and either Tiao or Parra is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey works in Zone 3, then Udall must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of sales representatives that could work in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already assigned to Zone 3, Tiao must be assigned to Zone 2, and Parra must be assigned to Zone 1.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn must be assigned to Zone 1.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to be assigned to Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already assigned to Zone 3, Tiao must be assigned to Zone 2, and Parra must be assigned to Zone 1.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must be the remaining sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 3.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must also work in Zone 3.
  We have accounted for four sales representatives in Zone 3 (Stuckey, Udall, Parra, and Quinn).
  We know that there are seven sales representatives in total.
  Therefore, the remaining three sales representatives (Kim, Mahr, and Tiao) must work in Zone 1 and Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.

  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be working in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall is already working in Zone 3, Tiao must be working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao is working in Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must be working in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  However, we already know that neither Parra nor Tiao is working in Zone 3, so Parra and Quinn must be working in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Tiao are the only sales representatives left to work in Zone 3.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Tiao and Udall work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and since Tiao works in Zone 3, Parra must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible sales representatives working in Zone 3 are Kim, Stuckey, and Udall.
  The answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3 together.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, and Udall cannot be in Zone 2.
  This means that Tiao must be in Zone 3, along with Stuckey and Udall.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, but we don't know which zone that is.
  However, we know that neither Parra nor Tiao can be in Zone 2, so they must both be in the same zone as each other and Quinn.
  Therefore, Parra, Quinn, and the remaining sales representative (either Kim or Mahr) must be in Zone 1.
  This leaves Kim or Mahr to be in Zone 3 with Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  Let's use the given information to determine which batches are made on each day.
  From the given information, we know that:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
    - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
    - Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
    - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
    - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We can use these conditions to create a schedule of when each batch is made:
    Monday: oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter
    Tuesday: sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter
    Wednesday: peanut butter, sugar, oatmeal
    Thursday: oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar
    Friday: peanut butter, oatmeal, sugar
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of oatmeal cookies (on Wednesday).
  If this is the case, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, which means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday (since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day).
  This also means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday (since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday).
  Using this information, we can determine which statement could be false:
    - Statement A is true, since at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
    - Statement B is true, since two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (peanut butter and sugar).
    - Statement C is true, since exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (oatmeal).
    - Statement D is false, since exactly two batches of cookies are not made on Tuesday (only one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday).
    - Statement E is true, since exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar).
  Therefore, the answer is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, and each batch is made on a single day.
  We also know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can deduce the following:
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday.
  - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  From this, we can determine the following:
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (one kind's first batch and another kind's third batch).
  - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (the remaining first batches).
  - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (the remaining second batches).
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (the remaining third batches).
  Therefore, the only statement that could be false is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  We know that each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal cookies are made on Monday, then peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (choice C is true).
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (choice C is true).
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (choice D is false).
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (choice B is true).
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (choice E is true).
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  Therefore, at least one batch of cookies is not made on one of the five days (choice A is false).
  Therefore, the answer is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can create a table to keep track of the batches of cookies made each day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal cookies are made on Monday, then peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday and Wednesday, and sugar cookies must be made on Thursday and Friday.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (oatmeal), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (peanut butter and sugar), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (oatmeal and peanut butter), at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days (oatmeal on Monday, peanut butter on Tuesday and Wednesday, sugar on Thursday and Friday), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar).
  The only statement that could be false is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can assume that:
  - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Monday.
  - The third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  From this arrangement, we can see that statement C could be false because there are two batches of cookies made on Monday. Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can deduce the following:
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on a different day than the third batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on a different day than the third batch of sugar cookies.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a different day than the third batch of sugar cookies.
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies is made on a day other than Thursday.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  From these deductions, we can conclude that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This means that (C) and (D) are true. 
  If we look at the remaining choices, we can see that (A) is true because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. 
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, it is possible that no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday or Friday. Therefore, (B) and (E) could be false.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
    1. Oatmeal first batch and Sugar third batch made on Wednesday.
    2. Peanut Butter first batch and Oatmeal third batch made on Friday.
    3. Sugar first batch and Peanut Butter third batch made on Tuesday.
  We need to check which statement could be false based on these combinations.
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True for all combinations)
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True for combination 1, False for combinations 2 and 3)
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False for all combinations)
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True for combination 3, False for combinations 1 and 2)
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True for all combinations)
  Therefore, the statement that could be false is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday, then peanut butter's first batch is made on Tuesday.
  If peanut butter's first batch is made on Tuesday, then sugar's first batch is made on Monday.
  If sugar's third batch is made on Thursday, then sugar's first batch is made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, sugar's first batch is not made on Tuesday.
  The statement that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We know that there are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal cookies are made on Monday, then peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  This means that C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday could be false.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of cookies can be either oatmeal or sugar, and the third batch can be either peanut butter or oatmeal.
  If the first batch is oatmeal and the third batch is peanut butter, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so B is true. At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday is false, so C is false. Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday is true, so D is true. Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday is true, so E is true. Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters - X - X - X - X - X - X.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment is Peters - X - X - X - X - Villas - White.
  If Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is Peters - X - X - X - Rovero - Villas - White - Tao.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero, then the order of recruitment is Peters - X - X - X - White - Rovero - Villas - Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be first.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, the order of the accomplices from first to last is: Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Stanton was recruited second.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then Stanton was recruited first.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either first or second.
  Tao was recruited sixth.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited after Rovero.
  Therefore, Rovero was recruited third.
  The only option that fits all the conditions is B: Rovero was recruited third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment could be: [Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao].
  Therefore, Tao could have been recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
- Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be the fifth person recruited.
- White was recruited earlier than Rovero, so White must be the sixth person recruited and Rovero must be the seventh person recruited.
- Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, so Tao must be the last person recruited.
- Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be the third person recruited.
- Therefore, the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
- The only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: 
  [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ?, ?, ?]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn must be recruited either first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton must be recruited either first, second, sixth, or seventh.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment must be:
  [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Stanton]
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be:
  [Villas, Quinn, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Stanton]
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be:
  [Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Quinn]
  If Tao was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment must be:
  [Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Quinn, Tao, Stanton]
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment must be:
  [Quinn, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Villas, Stanton]
  The only possible order of recruitment is [Villas, Quinn, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters, Stanton].
  Therefore, Tao was recruited fifth.
  The answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited before Rovero.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be recruited either before Quinn or after Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: [Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...]
  The only option that fits this order is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment is: Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first.
  Rovero was recruited third.
  Therefore, Rovero was not recruited sixth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited second.
  Tao was recruited sixth.
  Therefore, Tao was not recruited third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, Villas was not recruited sixth.
  The only option that could be true is C: Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of the first three recruits is unknown.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited last.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn cannot be recruited last.
  Therefore, Quinn must be recruited first or second.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton cannot be recruited third or sixth.
  Therefore, Stanton must be recruited first, second, fourth, or fifth.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero was recruited second, and Stanton cannot be recruited second or fourth.
  Therefore, Quinn was not recruited first.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then Rovero was recruited first, and Stanton cannot be recruited first or fifth.
  Therefore, Quinn was not recruited second.
  If Stanton was recruited fourth, then Tao was recruited third, and Rovero cannot be recruited third.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao was recruited first, and Rovero cannot be recruited first.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited second.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Rovero was recruited third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero in which X, Y, and Z are Quinn, Stanton, and Tao, but we don't know their order yet.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of X, Y, and Z is Quinn, Stanton, and Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment is Peters, Quinn, Stanton, Tao, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited fourth, and the answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the same shelf, which cannot be the top shelf since there are more books on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the same shelf as F and M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so neither O nor L can be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only books that could be on the bottom shelf are G and H.
  Choice C lists G and H, so it could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We do not know where G, H, I, K, L, and O are placed.
  We can eliminate C, D, and E because they do not have F and M on the same shelf.
  We can eliminate A because it only has two books on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the same shelf, which cannot be the top shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only books that could be on the bottom shelf are G and H.
  So, the answer is C: G, H, K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of books that could be on the bottom shelf is F, G, and M.
  The answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F and M are on the same shelf, and since I is on the middle shelf, F and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so either O or L must be on the top shelf.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so the top shelf must have at least two books.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know the exact number of books on each shelf, but we can eliminate some options based on the given conditions.
  Option A is incorrect because it only has two books on the bottom shelf, which is fewer than the number of books on the top shelf.
  Option B is incorrect because it has H on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  Option C is incorrect because it doesn't have any of the books that are placed on the same shelf as F.
  Option D is possible because it has all the books except for K on the bottom shelf, which satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Option E is incorrect because it has L on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they must be placed on the same shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the same shelf, which cannot be the top shelf.
  We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so neither F nor M can be placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf either.
  Therefore, the only books that could be placed on the bottom shelf are G and H.
  The answer is C: G, H, K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least 3 books.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, but we don't know which one.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L.
  We are left with G, H, and L as potential candidates for the bottom shelf.
  However, we need at least one more book to be on the bottom shelf to satisfy the condition that there are at least two books on each shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, we can deduce that I is on the middle shelf, and O is on the top shelf.
  We can also deduce that K is on the top shelf, and F and M are on the bottom shelf.
  From the answer choices, only A: F, M, is consistent with our deductions.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect on the publication schedule.
  This means that the condition should prevent M and N from being published in the same season.
  Choice A does not affect M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice B does not affect M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice C affects M and P, not M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition, so it is a possible answer.
  Choice E affects O and N, not M and N, so it is not the correct answer.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.

  Option A states that if L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This does not affect the publication schedule of N.
  Option B states that if N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This does not affect the publication schedule of M.
  Option C states that if M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This does not affect the publication schedule of N.
  Option D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition, as M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Option E states that if O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This does not affect the publication schedule of M.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

  Choice A does not affect M and N, so it is not the answer.
  Choice B does not affect M and N, so it is not the answer.
  Choice C does not affect M and N, so it is not the answer.
  Choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  This condition prevents M and N from being published in the same season, just like the original condition.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.

  Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Nina can give a report on Wednesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, George cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  Therefore, George must give a report on Monday.
  If Robert gives a report on Monday, then Olivia must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Monday.
  Therefore, Robert must give a report on Tuesday.
  The only remaining day for Nina to give a report is Monday.
  Therefore, Nina gives a report on Monday, George gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Tuesday.
  Helen must give a report on Wednesday.
  The only possible answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then they must give their reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday in some order.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but George cannot give a report on Wednesday, which is a contradiction.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, but George cannot give a report on Monday, which is a contradiction.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day, and George can give a report on Monday or Tuesday, and Robert can give a report on Monday or Wednesday.

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then only Helen, Irving, and Kyle are left to give reports.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means Kyle must give a report on Wednesday. But this is not possible because there are no more morning slots available.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day. This means that Helen can give a report on Monday and Irving can give a report on Tuesday. Kyle can give a report on Monday or Tuesday. Therefore, it is possible that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  We can use the given constraints to eliminate the options that cannot be true.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, option A cannot be true.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, option B cannot be true.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine whether the selection for the project is completely determined or not. Therefore, option C cannot be determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be selected, and the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined. The answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  Let's consider each option:
    A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we don't know if Taylor will be selected or not. Also, we don't know if Ruiz or Verma will be selected as a project member or not. So, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
    B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we don't know if Smith will be selected or not. Also, we don't know if Ruiz or Verma will be selected as a project member or not. So, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
    C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we don't know if Taylor will be selected or not. Also, we don't know if Ruiz or Verma will be selected as a project member or not. So, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
    D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we know that Verma will be selected as a project member. Also, we don't know if Quinn or Smith will be selected as a project member or not. So, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
    E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we know that Wells will be selected as a project member. Also, we know that Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader. So, this option completely determines the selection for the project.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that person must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  We need to determine which selection will completely determine the project members and the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, so this option is not valid.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, so this option is not valid.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we still have three workers to choose from, so this option is not valid.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we can only select one of Quinn, Smith, Taylor, or Xue to be the project leader. This leaves three workers to choose from for the remaining two project members. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can select any three workers from Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue to be project members, and then select one of Quinn or Ruiz to be the project leader. Therefore, this option completely determines the project members and the project leader.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that will completely determine the selection for the project.
  Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, and we cannot have a project leader. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, and we cannot have a project leader. So, this option cannot completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have four workers to choose from, and we cannot determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we have only one possibility for the project leader, which is Smith. And, we can choose only one worker from the remaining four workers. So, this option can completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we still have four workers to choose from, and we cannot determine the selection.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be either Wells, Xue, or Taylor.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be either Wells, Xue, or Ruiz.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be either Wells, Ruiz, or Smith.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Xue.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. Therefore, we cannot determine the project leader since we do not know who will be selected among the remaining four workers.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected. Therefore, we cannot determine the project leader since we do not know who will be selected among the remaining four workers.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have four workers to choose from. We cannot determine the project leader since we do not know who will be selected among the remaining four workers.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we have only one option for the project leader, which is either Quinn or Ruiz. We also know that Verma must be selected since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. Therefore, the remaining worker to be selected must be either Smith, Taylor, or Xue. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. But we still have four workers (Verma, Wells, Ruiz, and Xue) to choose from to fill the three spots, and we don't know who will be the leader. So this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. But we still have four workers (Verma, Wells, Ruiz, and Xue) to choose from to fill the three spots, and we don't know who will be the leader. So this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have five workers to choose from (Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells). Quinn can't be a project member unless he is the leader, but we don't know who the leader will be. So this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we still have five workers to choose from (Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue). Quinn and Ruiz can't be project members unless they are the leader, but we don't know who the leader will be. So this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we still have five workers to choose from (Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue). Quinn and Ruiz can't be project members unless they are the leader, and we know that Wells can't be a project member if Ruiz is not. So if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the only possible team is Smith, Taylor, and Wells, with Wells as the leader. This option completely determines the selection.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that will completely determine the selection for the project.
  We can start by analyzing each option and see if it provides enough information to determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we don't know if Taylor will be selected or not, so we cannot determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we don't know if Smith will be selected or not, so we cannot determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we don't know anything about the other workers, so we cannot determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we know that Verma will not be selected, and we also know that Quinn or Ruiz will be the project leader if they are selected, so we can determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we know that Wells will be selected, and we also know that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, so we can determine the selection.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected or E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. However, we need to choose the most likely answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, and the project leader cannot be Quinn or Ruiz. However, we still have four candidates left for the remaining two spots, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, and the project leader cannot be Smith or Taylor. However, we still have four candidates left for the remaining two spots, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have five candidates left for the three spots, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma cannot be selected, and the project leader cannot be Ruiz. We are left with four candidates for the remaining two spots, so this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected, and the project leader cannot be Ruiz. Taylor must also be selected, so we have determined all three members of the project, and the project leader is determined to be Wells. This option completely determines the selection.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find the answer choice that will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which means Smith cannot be a project member. But this does not determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means Taylor cannot be a project member. But this does not determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. If Quinn is the project leader, then Ruiz cannot be a project member, which means Wells cannot be a project member. If Ruiz is the project leader, then Quinn must be a project member, which means Wells cannot be a project member. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we cannot determine the selection for the project.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.

Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall cannot work in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then they cannot work in Zone 1.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Mahr cannot work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The only option left is that Mahr works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall does not work in Zone 2, then Tiao works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey works in the same sales zone as Mahr, then neither of them can work in Zone 3.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Parra works in Zone 3.
  The answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1 as well.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Udall cannot work in Zone 3 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only seven sales representatives and Udall already works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 3.
  The only choice that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao already works there.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The remaining sales representative, Mahr, works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Tiao already works there and there are only three sales zones.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1 and Mahr works in Zone 3.
  The answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Since Tiao works in Zone 2, Parra works in Zone 1.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn works in Zone 1.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Since Tiao and Udall work in Zone 2, then Mahr, Kim, and Stuckey work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.

  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim works in Zone 1.
  The only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.

  Also, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 and S must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S must be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, so Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of those photographs can be in the Sports section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then neither Hue nor Fuentes can have any photographs in the Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then neither Hue nor Gagnon can have any photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the answer is D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Response 9:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of the photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.
  This means that Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and that photographer cannot be Gagnon.
  This means that the only possible option is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on the given conditions.
  Option A: If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But, the table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  Option B: If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st. This satisfies the given conditions. Therefore, option B is possible.
  Option C: If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which means the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd or later. But, the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp, which means the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or earlier. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  Option D: If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  Option E: If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, which means the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or earlier. But, the sundial must be auctioned before the vase, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Based on the above analysis, the only possible option is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  We need to check if any of the choices violate the given conditions.
  Choice A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  Choice B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This violates the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Choice C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This violates the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Choice D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This satisfies all the given conditions and is a possible arrangement.
  Choice E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This violates the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  We need to find a possible date for each antique that satisfies all the conditions.
  Let's start with June 1st. The only antique that can be auctioned on June 1st is either the harmonica or the table.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd because the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, and the table is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd because the harmonica and the lamp have not been auctioned yet.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, which is not possible because the harmonica is already auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the lamp is not auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd, which is not possible because the harmonica is already auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the vase is not auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 3rd, which is possible.
  Therefore, it is possible that the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, it is not possible that the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, it is not possible that the mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  The only possible answer is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We have to check which option is consistent with all the given conditions.
  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned after the mirror. But we don't know if the harmonica is auctioned before or after the lamp. So, this option is not consistent with the given conditions.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. Then, the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Finally, the table must be auctioned before the vase. This option is consistent with all the given conditions.
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial and the mirror must be auctioned before the vase. But we don't know if the harmonica is auctioned before or after the lamp. So, this option is not consistent with the given conditions.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp. Then, the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Finally, the table must be auctioned before the vase. This option is consistent with all the given conditions.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned after the mirror. But we don't know if the harmonica is auctioned before or after the lamp. So, this option is not consistent with the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd or D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. 
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is consistent with these conditions.
  Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd, leaving the harmonica, lamp, and vase to be auctioned on the remaining days. This satisfies all the conditions, so option A could be true.
  Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned before June 2nd, which means the mirror must also be auctioned before June 2nd. However, this contradicts the condition that the mirror must be auctioned after the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp. Therefore, option B cannot be true.
  Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd. This leaves the harmonica, lamp, and mirror to be auctioned on the remaining days. However, this contradicts the condition that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, option C cannot be true.
  Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd. This leaves the sundial, mirror, and vase to be auctioned on the remaining days. If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the remaining antiques can be auctioned on the remaining days while satisfying all the conditions. Therefore, option D could be true.
  Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd. This leaves the harmonica, lamp, and vase to be auctioned on the remaining days. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th to satisfy the condition that the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp if the mirror is auctioned before the lamp. However, this contradicts the condition that the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, option E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or D. 
Action: Answer("A or D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  Now, we can check the answer choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible since the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is possible since the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st and the mirror on June 3rd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible since the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is not possible since the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st and the mirror on June 2nd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible since the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st, the lamp on June 2nd, the sundial on June 3rd, the vase on June 4th, and the table on June 6th.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  There are six antiques to be auctioned, and each antique is auctioned exactly once.
  Therefore, we can create a table to keep track of the possible dates for each antique.
  
| Antique | Possible Dates |
| ------- | -------------- |
| Harmonica | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 |
| Lamp | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 |
| Mirror | 3, 4, 5, 6 |
| Sundial | 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 |
| Table | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 |
| Vase | 3, 4, 5, 6 |

  From the table, we can see that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th. Also, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. If the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. Finally, the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  
  From the above analysis, we can see that the lamp could be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the answer is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  We also know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on either June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which option is possible based on the given conditions.
  
Option A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned after the mirror. 
  If the lamp is auctioned after the mirror, then the harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp.
  But, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp.
  If the mirror is auctioned before the lamp, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp.
  But, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the sundial must be auctioned before the vase.
  If the sundial is auctioned before the vase, then the mirror must be auctioned before the vase.
  If the mirror is auctioned before the vase, then the lamp must be auctioned before the mirror.
  If the lamp is auctioned before the mirror, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp.
  But, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp.
  If the mirror is auctioned before the lamp, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the lamp.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the table must be auctioned before the harmonica.
  Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Option E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned after the mirror.
  If the lamp is auctioned after the mirror, then the harmonica must be auctioned after the lamp.
  But, the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
The only possible option is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.

  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to find a date that satisfies all the given conditions.

  June 1st: 
  June 2nd: 
  June 3rd: 
  June 4th: 
  June 5th: 
  June 6th:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can only occur between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes according to the given rules.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Yates House.
  E can be true because Trustcorp owns Lynch Building and RealProp owns Garza Tower, which can be traded with each other according to the given rules. Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can start by identifying the buildings owned by each company and their respective classes.
  RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: Flores Tower (class 1), Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), Ortiz Building (class 2).
  We can then analyze each statement to see if it is possible or not.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 3, but the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Therefore, this statement can be true.
  C: Southco does not own the King Building, and RealProp does not own the Ortiz Building. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp does not own the Yates House. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), but Trustcorp does not own any class 1 building. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  The statement that cannot be true is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This cannot be true, as RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. - This can be true, as Southco can trade the Flores Tower for the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This cannot be true, as Southco does not own any of these buildings.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. - This can be true, as Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the Yates House and the Ortiz Building for the Flores Tower.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. - This cannot be true, as Trustcorp does not own any of these buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  If a building is traded, it must be traded for a building of the same class or a building of a higher class.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House cannot be traded for the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building because they are all class 2 buildings or higher.
  The Flores Tower cannot be traded for the Yates House or the Zimmer House because they are both class 3 buildings.
  The Garza Tower cannot be traded for the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building because they are both class 2 buildings.
  The Lynch Building cannot be traded for the Garza Tower because the Garza Tower is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true because these buildings are owned by Trustcorp, not RealProp. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can eliminate choices that are possible based on the given information.
  RealProp owns only class 1 and class 3 buildings, so A is impossible.
  Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings, so B and C are impossible.
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings, so D is impossible.
  The only remaining choice is E.
  If Trustcorp owned the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, then RealProp would need to trade one of its class 1 buildings for two class 2 buildings. However, Southco only owns one class 2 building, so this trade would be impossible.
  Therefore, E cannot be true, no matter how many trades are made.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option is impossible, regardless of the trades made.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Option A is impossible because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  Option B is possible because Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  Option C is impossible because Southco does not own the King Building.
  Option D is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  Option E is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House is class 3, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  The Garza Tower is class 1, so it can be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The Flores Tower is class 1, so it can be traded for two class 3 buildings or one class 2 building.
  The Lynch Building is class 2, so it can be traded for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building.
  The King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building are all class 2, so they can be traded for one class 1 building and one class 3 building.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House.
  E can be true because Trustcorp owns the Lynch Building and RealProp owns the Garza Tower, but it is not guaranteed.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House.
  Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  There are only three kinds of trades that can be made.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Yates House.
  E cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower or Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A trade can only be made between buildings of the same class or between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings or between a class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Yates House.
  E can be true because Trustcorp can trade King Building for Garza Tower and Meyer Building for Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, regardless of how many trades are made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Statement A is impossible because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson

  Exactly six photographers are available but not all have to be assigned.
  The Silva University ceremony must have at least two photographers.
  From the given choices, A, B, and D have Frost or Heideck but not both, which violates the constraint that Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  Choice C has only two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which is not enough.
  Choice E does not have Gonzalez, who must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony if Lai is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Gonzalez, Knutson.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  There are six photographers available, but not all have to be assigned.
  Let's try to assign photographers to the Silva University ceremony based on the given constraints.
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, so we can assign them to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so we cannot assign Gonzalez to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so we must assign Knutson to the Thorne University ceremony.
  We have assigned Frost, Heideck, and Knutson, which leaves us with Lai, Gonzalez, and Mays.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies, so we cannot assign both of them to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
  The answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, Lai cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  The possible combinations of photographers are Frost and Heideck, Gonzalez and Lai, and Mays and Heideck.
  The complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony could be Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, and then five others.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited first.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was recruited either third, fourth, or fifth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White was recruited last.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero was recruited fourth, Stanton was recruited fifth, and Villas was recruited sixth. This means that White was recruited last, which is not possible.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Quinn was recruited third, Stanton was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited sixth. This means that White was recruited last, which is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Quinn was recruited third, Rovero was recruited fourth, and Villas was recruited fifth. This means that White was recruited last, which is possible.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then Stanton was recruited fifth, Rovero was recruited fourth, and Quinn was recruited third. This means that White was recruited last, which is not possible.
  If White was recruited third, then Villas was recruited second, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is:
  1. unknown
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. unknown
  6. unknown
  7. unknown
  From the given information, we know that:
  - Stanton was not immediately before or after Tao.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, we can conclude that:
  - Quinn cannot be recruited third because he was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  - Villas cannot be recruited sixth because she was recruited immediately before White.
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be recruited third.
  - Stanton cannot be recruited sixth because he was not immediately before or after Tao.
  That leaves us with only one option:
  - Rovero was recruited fifth.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the seven accomplices is:
  1. ?
  2. Tao
  3. ?
  4. Peters
  5. ?
  6. ?
  7. ?
  Peters was recruited fourth, so he must be in position 4.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be in position 6 and White must be in position 7.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be in position 3 and Rovero must be in position 5.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be in position 1 or 3.
  Therefore, the only possible position for Stanton is position 6.
  The only remaining position is position 1, which must be filled by Peters.
  The order of the seven accomplices is:
  1. Peters
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Stanton
  7. Villas
  Therefore, the answer is D: Villas was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know Peters was recruited fourth and Tao was recruited second.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, ___, ___, ___, ___, ___.
  We know Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited before Rovero.
  We know Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be recruited before White.
  We know Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton must be recruited either third or fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, Stanton, ___, ___, ___, ___.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Therefore, A could be true.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, Stanton, ___, Rovero, Villas, White.
  But we know Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so B cannot be true.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, ___, ___, ___, Stanton, Villas, White.
  But we know Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so C cannot be true.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, ___, ___, ___, ___, Villas, White.
  But we know Villas was recruited immediately before White, so D cannot be true.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Tao, White, ___, ___, ___, ___.
  But we know Villas was recruited immediately before White, so E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that could be true is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: 
  1. unknown
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. unknown
  6. unknown
  7. unknown
  From the given information, we know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao. Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited either first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh. 
  We also know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1. Quinn, Tao, unknown, Peters, unknown, Rovero, Villas, White
  2. unknown, Tao, Quinn, Peters, unknown, Rovero, Villas, White
  3. unknown, Tao, unknown, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White

  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is now: [?, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Quinn must be either first or second.
  If Quinn was first, then the order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be recruited sixth because Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, Villas must be either third or fourth.
  If Villas was third, then the order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Tao, Villas, Peters, ?, ?, ?]. 
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited second or fourth. Therefore, Stanton must be either first, third, fifth, or sixth.
  If Stanton was first, then the order of recruitment is: [Stanton, Tao, Villas, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  If White was recruited last, then the order of recruitment is: [Stanton, Tao, Villas, Peters, ?, ?, White].

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 51 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Image's voicemail target is 2 days.
  B: Image's website target is 2 days.
  C: Image's website target is 1 day.
  D: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  E: Solide's website target is 1 day.
Response 0:
Thought:
If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day and its voicemail target must be 2 days, because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means Solide's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days, because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target and Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
Therefore, the answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, then Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target is 2 days or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles is either QSJGHR or GHRJQS.
  If the order is QSJGHR, then Q must be third and S must be first or second.
  If the order is GHRJQS, then R must be sixth or seventh.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. But Q cannot be third because it would violate the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  If S is second, then Q must be first. But Q cannot be first because it would violate the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  If S is third, then Q can be either second or first. If Q is first, then R must be sixth and G must be fifth. But J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be second. Therefore, Q must be second, and R must be first. Then, G must be fifth and J must be sixth. Finally, H must be seventh.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q is second.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Since Q can only be third if S is earlier, Q cannot be third.
  Therefore, Q must be first or second.
  Since G must be earlier than R, and R cannot be first, G must be second or third.
  Since J must be earlier than G, J cannot be third, so J must be first or second.
  Therefore, the only possible order is S _ _ Y _ _ _.
  Since Q cannot be third, Q must be first, and G must be third.
  Therefore, the order is S Q _ Y _ _ G.
  The only remaining articles are H, J, and R, which must be edited in the order J, R, H.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Q cannot be first because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If S is first, then Q must be second and R must be fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If S is second, then Q must be third and R must be sixth or seventh.
  If S is third, then Q must be first and R must be fifth or sixth.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If J is first, then G must be second and R must be third, fourth, or fifth.
  If J is second, then G must be third and R must be fifth or sixth.
  If J is third, then G must be fourth and R must be seventh.
  Therefore, J must be third.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If S is second, then Q must be first, which means G must be fourth, and H and J must be fifth and sixth, respectively. This satisfies all the conditions, and J is second.
  If S is third, then Q can be first, second, or third. However, if Q is first or second, then G cannot be earlier than R, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, Q must be third, which means G must be fourth, and H and J must be fifth and sixth, respectively. This satisfies all the conditions, and J is third.
  Therefore, J must be either second or third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the first three articles must be either GHS or HGS.
  J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be first.
  If J is second, then G must be first, and H must be third. But this violates the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  Therefore, J must be third, and G must be first.
  Since G is first and R must be after G, then R must be either fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  S must be earlier than Y, so S must be either second or third.
  If Q is first, then S must be third, which violates the rule that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  Therefore, Q cannot be first.
  If Q is second, then S must be third, and the order of the last four articles must be RSYN.
  If Q is third, then S can be either second or third, and the order of the last four articles must be either RYSN or RSYN.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
  The answer is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means G must be second and H must be fourth, and R must be fifth. This violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first and H must be fourth, and R must be fifth. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third, G must be first, H must be fourth, R must be fifth, J must be sixth, and S must be second.
  The only statement that must be true is that Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be fourth.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other, so the first article cannot be G, H, J, Q, R, or S.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so the order must be JGR or RGJ.
  If J is first, then G must be second and R must be seventh, which violates the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If G is first, then J must be third and R must be seventh.
  The articles covering nutrition must be in the middle, so the order must be GQSJRY or RGQSJY.
  If Q is first, then S must be second, which violates the rule that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, and the order must be SQRGJY.
  Therefore, Q is third.
  The answer is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, and R must be fifth or sixth. This means G, H, and J must be edited second, fourth, and seventh, but this violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, and R must be fifth or sixth. This means G, H, and J must be edited first, fourth, and seventh, but this violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second, and R must be sixth. This means G, H, and J must be edited second, fourth, and seventh. The remaining article, Y, must be edited fifth, and the first article must be one of the nutrition articles, Q or S. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, Q must be second or third, and J must be earlier than G.
  The only choice that matches this is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. But if Q is third, then G must be earlier than R, which is not possible since G cannot be first or second. Therefore, S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. But if Q is third, then G must be earlier than R, which is not possible since G cannot be first or second. Therefore, S cannot be second.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second. But if Q is first, then G must be third, which is not possible since J must be earlier than G. Therefore, Q cannot be first. Therefore, Q must be second.
  If Q is second, then G must be first and R must be seventh. J can be second or third.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q is second, and J can be second or third.

  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then the remaining representative in Zone 1 will be either Parra or Tiao, which is not possible as one of them is already assigned to Zone 1. Hence, A must be false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be at most two representatives in Zone 1, which is not possible as one of Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1. Hence, B must be false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be at most two representatives in Zone 1, which is not possible as one of Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1. Hence, C must be false.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there will be at most two representatives in Zone 1, which is not possible as one of Parra or Tiao must be in Zone 1. Hence, D must be false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then the remaining representative in Zone 1 will be either Tiao or Udall, which is not possible as one of them is already assigned to Zone 2. Hence, E must be false.

  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Not mentioned in the conditions, so it could be true)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Not possible, as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Possible, as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Possible, as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Not possible, as either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1)
  
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.

  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (This is possible because we don't know where Kim works.)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where Kim works.)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where Mahr works.)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where the other sales representatives work.)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (This is not possible because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Stuckey must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.)

  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.

  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2, but this contradicts the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, A must be false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B must be false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, C may be true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is consistent with the given conditions. Therefore, D may be true.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then either Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2, but this contradicts the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, E must be false.

  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1.
  Option B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.

Response 7:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We need to find the statement that cannot be true based on these conditions.
  Let's evaluate each statement:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. - This is possible, but not required by the given conditions.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is possible, but not required by the given conditions.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is possible, but not required by the given conditions.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. - This is possible, but not required by the given conditions.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. - This cannot be true because we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.

  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (This is possible because we don't know where Kim works yet.)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where Kim works yet.)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where Mahr works yet.)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (This is possible because we don't know where Mahr and Udall work yet.)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (This is impossible because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that Parra works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3. If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1. If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn also works in Zone 3, and Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.)
  
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Kim cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2 because both of those zones have already been assigned to other sales representatives. Therefore, option A is false.
  Similarly, we can conclude that Kim cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more sales representatives working in that zone than in Zone 2, and we already know that both Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, which means that there are only two spots left in that zone. Therefore, option B is also false.
  We cannot conclude anything about Mahr's and Udall's zones, so option D may be true or false.
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so it is possible that both Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3. Therefore, option C may be true or false.
  Finally, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and we know that Stuckey cannot work in Zone 1 because he works in the same zone as Udall. Therefore, option E is false.
  The only option that must be false is A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Based on the above conditions, we can create a schedule of breeds for each day.
  Using the schedule, we can evaluate each of the answer choices to see if it is possible.
  A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then one breed would have to be featured on four days, which violates the conditions. So, A is not possible.
  B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which violates the conditions. So, B is not possible.
  C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 1, which violates the conditions. So, C is not possible.
  D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans would have to be featured on day 7, which violates the conditions. So, D is not possible.
  E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would have to be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is possible. So, E could be true.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7 and not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  We need to find an option that is possible given the above conditions.
  
Option A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then one breed will be featured on only one day. This is not possible since Himalayans are featured on exactly three days.
Option B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans will be featured on day 1 which is not possible.
Option C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans will be featured on day 1 which is not possible.
Option D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans will not be featured on day 7 and Rottweilers will not be featured on any day that Himalayans are. This is possible.
Option E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers will be featured on day 7 which is not possible.

Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Response 2:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  For A to be true, there would have to be 4 breeds that are each featured on three days. However, there are only 6 breeds in total, so this is not possible.
  For B to be true, Himalayans would have to be featured on the same days as Greyhounds. However, Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so this is not possible.
  For C to be true, Greyhounds would have to be featured on the same days as Himalayans. However, Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but Greyhounds are featured on seven consecutive days, so this is not possible.
  For D to be true, Himalayans would have to be featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. This is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  For E to be true, Rottweilers would have to be featured on every day that Himalayans are not. This is not possible because Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but there are only seven days in total, so there would not be enough days for Rottweilers to be featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Choice A is impossible because there are only three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
  Choice B is impossible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Choice C is impossible because Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  Choice D is possible because Himalayans are not featured on any day that Rottweilers are.
  Choice E is impossible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  To satisfy the condition that Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they cannot be featured on day 1 or day 7.
  To satisfy the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, Rottweilers cannot be featured on the same days as Himalayans.
  Therefore, Himalayans and Rottweilers cannot be featured on the same day.
  Choice A is not possible because there are only six breeds, so at least one breed must be featured on two days.
  Choice B is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Choice C is not possible because Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  Choice D is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Choice E is not possible because Rottweilers are featured on day 7, where Himalayans are not featured.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. - This cannot be true since there are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. - This cannot be true since Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. - This cannot be true since Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. - This could be true since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. - This cannot be true since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Based on the above conditions, we can try to find the possible combinations of breeds on each day.
  If we assume that Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4, then we can deduce the following:
  Day 1: Greyhound + (Newfoundland or Manx)
  Day 2: (Siamese or Manx) + Newfoundland
  Day 3: Himalayan + (Greyhound or Newfoundland)
  Day 4: (Siamese or Manx) + Greyhound
  Day 5: (Himalayan or Siamese) + Rottweiler
  Day 6: (Newfoundland or Manx) + (Himalayan or Siamese)
  Day 7: (Greyhound or Siamese) + (Newfoundland or Manx)
  Therefore, we can see that choice D could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
  There are three breeds of kitten and three breeds of puppy.
  Therefore, each breed of kitten and each breed of puppy must be featured on three days.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Therefore, the breeds must alternate every day.
  If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then they cannot be featured on day 1, and they cannot be featured on day 7.
  If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then they cannot be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 if Himalayans are featured on any of those days.
  If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans must be featured on day 1, which is not possible.
  If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Himalayans must be featured on days 1, 3, and 5, which is not possible because Greyhounds are not featured on day 2 or day 4.
  If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers must be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.

A. If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there must be a breed that is featured on two consecutive days, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, A is not true.
B. If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans must be featured on day 1, which violates the condition that Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B is not true.
C. If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds must be featured on day 4, which violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Therefore, C is not true.
D. If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 7, which satisfies the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, D could be true.
E. If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on any day that features Himalayans, which satisfies the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Therefore, E could be true.

Answer: Answer("D") or Answer("E") could be true, but D is a better answer.

  Therefore, Image's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days.
  Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  Truvest's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days. Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.

  If Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If Solide's voicemail target is 2 days, then Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so it must be 1 day.
  Therefore, Image's website target is 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so it must be 2 days.
  Truvest's website target cannot be 3 days, so it must be 1 day or 2 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 1 day, then Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.

  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days.
  Therefore, Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days or less.
  From the conditions, Solide's website target is 2 days and Image's website target is 1 day.
  Therefore, Truvest's website target is 3 days.
  All of the answer choices except for one must be true based on the given conditions.
  The answer is C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:

  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day, and the other clients' voicemail targets are 2 days.
  If Image's website target is 1 day, then Solide's website target must be 2 days.
  If Image's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they are all true based on the given conditions.
  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day, and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then both photographs in the Sports section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, and exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  It is not possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, or neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes or Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one must be by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  Based on the above conditions, the only possible scenario is that one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue and the other is by Gagnon.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there is no photograph in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there is no photograph in the Metro section by Gagnon.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there is no photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Sports section must not be by Hue.
  The answer is E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  This means that both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon.
  Also, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Since one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, the other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Fuentes or Hue.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  The answer is D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the third photographer, Gagnon, must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  There are only two photographs per section, so if Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Sports section.
  If Hue has one photograph in the Sports section, then Fuentes must also have one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which is one.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is one, then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is also one.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes, because Fuentes already has one photograph in the Sports section.
  Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, so it is possible that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  It is also possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  However, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue, because Fuentes already has one photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon or C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who also has a photograph in the Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no photograph in the Metro section by Hue, which contradicts the given condition.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there would be no photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes, which contradicts the given condition.
  If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes, which satisfies all the given conditions.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be greater than the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given condition.
  If neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be less than the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If Gagnon has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  If the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one must be by Hue.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because Fuentes already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Also, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because Gagnon has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue because each photographer can have at most three photographs in one section and Fuentes already has one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  The answer is E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  This means that both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon.
  Also, it is not clear whether both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue or not.
  Therefore, the answer could be A, C, or E.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because Fuentes already has a photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue because the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by either Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
  Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  Choice C violates the rule that F and K cannot both be selected.
  Choice D satisfies all the rules.
  Choice E violates the rule that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  Therefore, the answer is D: H, K, M, P, R.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, we need to select one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we can select either one botanist and one zoologist or one botanist and one chemist.
  F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, we cannot select F and K together.
  K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, we cannot select K and M together.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, if we select M, we must also select P and R.
  Let's go through each option:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q - This option violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.
  B: G, H, K, L, M - This option includes one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and one zoologist (M). However, it violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.
  C: G, H, K, L, R - This option includes one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and one zoologist (R). It does not violate any of the given conditions. Therefore, this option is acceptable.
  D: H, K, M, P, R - This option includes one botanist (H), one chemist (K), and two zoologists (M, P, and R). It violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.
  E: H, L, M, P, Q - This option includes one botanist (H), one chemist (L), and two zoologists (M, P, and Q). It violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Therefore, this option is not acceptable.
  The only acceptable selection of scientists for the panel is C: G, H, K, L, R.

  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  The team must include at least four employees.
  Using the above rules, we can see that option A is not possible because it violates the rule that neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team with Myers.
  Option B is not possible because it violates the rule that if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  Option C is not possible because it violates the rule that if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Option D is a possible selection because it satisfies all the given conditions.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3. This means that there are two sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 3.
  This leaves us with only two possibilities: Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, or Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1. This means that there are three sales representatives in Zone 1, which satisfies the given condition. Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2. 
  If Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 1, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 1. This means that there are three sales representatives in Zone 1, which satisfies the given condition. Kim, Mahr, and Parra must work in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, either Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, or Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 1. 
  This means that Mahr cannot work in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must also work in Zone 3, which means that Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3 as well. This would make it impossible for Tiao to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given conditions.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1. This means that Quinn must work in Zone 1, which means that Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 1 as well. This would make it impossible for more sales representatives to work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Udall works in Zone 3.
  The answer is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Zone 3 must have at least 4 sales representatives.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then the other must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they must work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they must work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because if Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, and there would be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, Quinn, Stuckey must work in Zone 3.
  The answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be either two or three.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey must work in Zone 3. Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, they must work in Zone 1 with Parra and one other sales representative. Therefore, there are three sales representatives working in Zone 1, two sales representatives working in Zone 2, and two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then only A and D could be true.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means that there would be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, A is not true.
  If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means that there would be more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, B is not true.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, which means that Udall must work in Zone 1. This would imply that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, C is not true.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which means that Stuckey must work in Zone 3. This would imply that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, D is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then either 3 or 4 sales representatives work in Zone 3 and 3 or 2 sales representatives work in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then either 4 or 5 sales representatives work in Zone 1 and 3 or 2 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and Quinn works in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey and Udall both work in Zone 2. But this violates the condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and Udall works in Zone 3. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3, and Quinn and Mahr work in Zone 1. Kim must work in Zone 2. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  The only choice that satisfies this condition is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2, and there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then either Parra or Udall works in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then either Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall all work in the same zone, or they are split into two groups of two.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3, 4, or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, then either Parra or Udall is in Zone 1, and the other is in Zone 2. This means Tiao is in Zone 3, and the remaining four sales representatives are split into two groups of two, with one group in each of the remaining zones. In this case, neither Kim nor Mahr can be in Zone 2, so choices A and B are not true. Parra works in Zone 1, so choice C could be true. Tiao works in Zone 3, so choice D is true. Udall works in Zone 2, so choice E is not true.
  If there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, then either Parra and Udall are both in Zone 1, or one of them is in Zone 1 and the other is in Zone 2. This means Tiao is in Zone 3, and the remaining three sales representatives are split into two groups of two, with one group in each of the remaining zones. In either case, neither Kim nor Mahr can be in Zone 2, so choices A and B are not true. Parra works in Zone 1, so choice C could be true. Tiao works in Zone 3, so choice D is true. Udall works in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, so choice E could be true.
  If there are 5 sales representatives in Zone 1, then either Parra and Udall are both in Zone 1, or one of them is in Zone 1 and the other is in Zone 2. This means Tiao is in Zone 3, and the remaining two sales representatives are both in Zone 3. In either case, neither Kim nor Mahr can be in Zone 2, so choices A and B are not true. Parra works in Zone 1, so choice C could be true. Tiao works in Zone 3, so choice D is true. Udall works in either Zone 1 or Zone 2, so choice E could be true.
  Therefore, choices C, D, and either E or neither E could be true, depending on whether Udall is in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 must be less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then at most two sales representatives can work in Zone 1 and at most two sales representatives can work in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall must work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, the only possible configuration is that two sales representatives work in Zone 1, two sales representatives work in Zone 2, and three sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then either one or two sales representatives work in Zone 1, and either one or no sales representatives work in Zone 2.
  The only possible configurations are:
    1. Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 3. This configuration satisfies the given conditions, and Tiao works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 1, and the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
    2. Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. This configuration satisfies the given conditions, and Udall works in Zone 1. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 1, and the answer is not E: Udall works in Zone 3.
    3. Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. This configuration satisfies the given conditions, and Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3, and the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: Tiao works in Zone 1, or C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then Parra and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which are Stuckey, Udall, and Parra/Quinn.
  This means that there are at most 4 sales representatives working in Zone 1, which are Kim, Mahr, Tiao, and Parra/Quinn.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives working in Zone 3, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, none of the choices could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 1 must be either 1 or 2.
  If Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 1 and at least one sales representative working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2 must be either 2 or 1.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other one must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then at most two sales representatives can work in Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3, which means there can be at most one more sales representative working in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which means there can be at most one more sales representative working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test J on the first day.
  Theresa must test H on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test F on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki must test H on the second day.
  The only remaining bicycle is G, which means that Reynaldo must test F on the second day.
  Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J on the second day, because he already tested J on the first day.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day. Therefore, Seamus must test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must test H on either the first or second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo must test G on the first day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test G on the first day.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test F on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H on the first day.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test F or H on the second day.
  If Seamus tests F on the second day, then Reynaldo must test J.
  If Seamus tests H on the second day, then Yuki must test J.
  Therefore, Yuki tests J on the second day.
  Theresa cannot test G on the second day because she has already tested J on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa is not one of the testers for G.
  The only possible answer is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test one of F, G, or H.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is not J, so Seamus must test F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo must test F or J on the second day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because he must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is not H.
  Therefore, Seamus tests F or G on the first day.
  If Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo must test J on the second day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Seamus tests G on the first day, and Reynaldo tests J on the second day.
  This means that Seamus tests H on the second day, and Yuki tests F on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus tests J on the first day.

  Therefore, Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki tests H on the second day.
  The only remaining bicycle is F, which Seamus tests on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus is not one of the testers for J.
  The only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus tests J on the first day.
  Seamus tests the bicycle that Yuki tests on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki tests F on the second day.
  Theresa must test H.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  The only option that could be true is Seamus is one of the testers for J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test F and Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so H must be tested by either Seamus or Reynaldo.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus cannot test F.
  Therefore, Seamus must test either G or H on the first day.
  If Seamus tests G on the first day, then Reynaldo must test H on the second day, and Yuki must test F on the second day. This means that Seamus would have to test J on the second day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day.
  This means that Reynaldo must test G on the second day, and Yuki must test F on the second day.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus must test J on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test F on the first day. 
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so Seamus cannot test J on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so either Seamus or Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  Let's check each choice:
    A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
      We don't know who tests G on the first day, so this could be true.
    B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
      Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so this cannot be true.
    C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
      Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test either F, G, or H. If Yuki tests H on the second day, then Seamus must test J on the second day. But Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so this cannot be true.
    D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
      Seamus cannot test J on the first day, so this cannot be true.
    E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
      Either Seamus or Reynaldo must test G on the first day, so this could be true.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or E.
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Therefore, Theresa cannot test J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Therefore, Yuki must test F on the first day.
  On the second day, Seamus must test Yuki's bicycle from the first day, which is F.
  Theresa must test H on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test G.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G or H on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day, so he must test F or G.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test F or H.
  If Reynaldo tests G on the first day, then he must test H on the second day, which means Seamus must test F on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J.
  If Seamus tests G on the first day, then he must test F on the second day, which means Reynaldo must test H on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo cannot be one of the testers for G.
  If Yuki tests F on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the second day, which means Theresa must test G on the second day. Therefore, Theresa cannot be one of the testers for J or H.
  If Yuki tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the second day, which means Reynaldo must test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo could test G on the second day.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left.
  We can use the process of elimination to determine the answer.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Olivia cannot give an afternoon report, so she must give a morning report.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, so they cannot give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Robert has not been eliminated yet, so he can give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, George, and Helen.
  The answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  We need to consider the condition that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We can use the conditions to create a chart to determine the possible morning reports for each day.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon |         |           |
| Tue | George  |           |
| Wed |         |           |

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he must be in the morning slot on Tuesday.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon |         |           |
| Tue | George  |           |
| Wed |         |           |

  We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must be in the morning slot on Monday and Wednesday.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon | Olivia  |           |
| Tue | George  |           |
| Wed | Robert  |           |

  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then there are no conditions on Thursday's reports. If Nina's report is given on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. If Nina's report is given on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, we need to consider three cases: Nina gives a report on Monday, Nina gives a report on Tuesday, or Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  
Case 1: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon | Nina    |           |
| Tue | George  | Olivia    |
| Wed | Robert  | Helen     |

  In this case, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are Nina, George and Olivia, and Robert and Helen, respectively.
  
Case 2: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon | Olivia  | Nina      |
| Tue | George  | Robert    |
| Wed | Helen   |           |

  In this case, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are Olivia and Nina, George and Robert, and Helen, respectively.
  
Case 3: Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  
| Day | Morning | Afternoon |
| --- | ------- | --------- |
| Mon | Olivia  | Robert    |
| Tue | George  |           |
| Wed | Nina    | Helen     |

  In this case, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are Olivia and Robert, George, and Nina and Helen, respectively.
  
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina (not possible)
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (not possible)
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (not possible)
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (not possible)
  E: Robert, George, and Helen (not possible)
  
  None of the above choices are possible.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  From the given choices, the only possible combination of students that can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find three people who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, under the given conditions.
  We know George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the three people who can give morning reports.
  Therefore, the three people who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are Helen, Nina, and George.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that six students will give reports over three days, with two reports given each day.
  We also know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since each day has one morning and one afternoon report, we can eliminate any answer choices that have more than one student giving a report in the same time slot.
  From the remaining answer choices, we can see that the only one that works is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which students can give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since there are only two reports per day, we can eliminate the choices that have three students giving morning reports on a single day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.
  Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Robert, and Helen.
  The answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Action: Answer("D")

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Therefore, we can eliminate George, Kyle, Lenore, and Nina from the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  Helen, Irving, Olivia, and Robert can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina does not give a report on Monday, then she must give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday. If she gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Thursday, which means that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Robert, and Irving (choice D).
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have 6 students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find a combination of three students for each day, and each student can only give one report.
  We can start by checking the possible combinations for Monday morning.
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we know that they cannot be in any of the combinations.
  We can check the possible combinations for Monday morning with the remaining six students.
  We can then check the possible combinations for Tuesday morning and Wednesday morning with the remaining students.
  We need to make sure that the conditions are satisfied for each day.
  We can eliminate the choices that do not satisfy the conditions.
  The answer is the choice that satisfies all the conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:

  We need to find the students who could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday, and it must be in the morning.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the students who could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are Helen, George, and Nina.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they are not part of the six students who will give individual oral reports.
  Therefore, the six students who will give individual oral reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We know that Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which means they cannot give morning reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Wednesday, which means they can give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, Olivia, and Helen.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F and M must be on the same shelf as well, which means F and M must be on the middle shelf with I. Then, K, G, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all the given conditions, so the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find the condition that will fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, we can determine the placement of F and therefore, the placement of all the other books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement is sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If statement A is true, it means that I and M are on the same shelf. Since I is on the middle shelf, M must also be on the middle shelf. This means that F and K must be on the top shelf, and G, H, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, statement A is sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  If statement B is true, it means that K and G are on the same shelf. Since K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is on the same shelf as M, this means that K, F, and M must be on the middle shelf, and G, H, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, statement B is not sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  If statement C is true, it means that L and F are on the same shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, this means that F and M must be on the middle shelf, and K, G, H, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, statement C is not sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  If statement D is true, it means that M and H are on the same shelf. Since F is on the same shelf as M, this means that F, M, and H must be on the middle shelf, and K, G, L, and O must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, statement D is not sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  If statement E is true, it means that H and O are on the same shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, this means that O, L, and F must be on the middle shelf, and K, G, H, and M must be on the bottom shelf. Therefore, statement E is not sufficient to fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If M is placed on the top shelf, then F is also placed on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, M must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If M is placed on the middle shelf, then F must also be placed on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, M must be placed on the bottom shelf, and F must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If F is placed on the middle shelf, then K must be placed on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, F must be placed on the top shelf, and K must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If K is placed on the bottom shelf, then O must also be placed on the bottom shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, K must be placed on the middle shelf, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  The remaining books, G and H, must be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know the exact placement of F, M, and I.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf and F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, G, H, and either F or M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We can eliminate choices A, B, D, and E because they do not provide enough information to determine the placement of all the books.
  The only remaining choice is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. If this is true, then F and L must be placed on the bottom shelf with G and H, and K, I, and O must be placed on the top and middle shelves. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf and F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, H and G must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We can see that the placement of each book is fully determined by the placement of F, M, K, L, O, H, and G.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some possibilities and determine the placement of the books.
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then we know that either K or O must be on the top shelf, and the other one must be on the bottom shelf.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf, and F cannot be on the top shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf, and L cannot be on the top shelf.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then they must be on the middle or bottom shelf together.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where K, L, F, G, or H are placed, so this choice does not fully determine the placement of the books.
  B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where I, L, F, H, or O are placed, so this choice does not fully determine the placement of the books.
  C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must be on the same shelf as well, and we can use the other conditions to determine the placement of the books. For example, K and O must be on the top and bottom shelves, respectively. This choice fully determines the placement of the books.
  D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where I, K, L, F, G, or O are placed, so this choice does not fully determine the placement of the books.
  E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where I, K, L, F, G, or M are placed, so this choice does not fully determine the placement of the books.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We are given that there are three shelves, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that two books are placed on the same shelf, we can determine the placement of the third book on the remaining shelf.
  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then we know that F and M must be on the top and bottom shelves, respectively.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the middle shelf and F must be on the top shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then O must be on the middle or top shelf and L must be on the bottom or middle shelf.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then we know that F and M are on the top and bottom shelves, respectively.
  Therefore, if I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know the placement of F, K, L, and O, and the placement of each book is fully determined.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can use this as a reference point.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know that F must also be on that shelf, but we don't know if it's the top, middle, or bottom shelf. We also don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, M, I, H, L, or O are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on that shelf, but we don't know if it's the top, middle, or bottom shelf. We also don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we know that F must also be on that shelf, but we don't know if it's the top, middle, or bottom shelf. We also don't know where the other books are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we don't know where F, M, I, K, G, or L are placed, so it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  We know that G must be edited after J and before R.
  We know that Q must be third if S is before Q.
  We know that S must be edited before Y.
  We know that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be edited before Y, and Q must be third, which means R must be seventh. We can determine the order of the articles.
  If H is fourth, then we can have the following order: G, R, Q, S, Y, H, J. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If H is sixth, we cannot determine the order because we do not know where to place the finance articles.
  If R is fourth, we cannot determine the order because we do not know where to place the wildlife article.
  If R is seventh, we can have the following order: J, G, H, Q, S, R, Y. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If Y is fifth, we can have the following order: J, G, R, Q, S, Y, H. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is fourth. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  S must be earlier than Y, so Y cannot be fifth. Eliminate E.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. So, R cannot be fourth. Eliminate C.
  That leaves us with three answer choices: A, B, and D.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S. But S cannot be earlier than Q unless Q is third. So, this is not possible. Eliminate A.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be G, J, and H. The next article cannot be R because G must be earlier than R. The next article cannot be Q because Q must be third if S is earlier than Q. So, the next article must be either S or Y. But S must be earlier than Y, so the order must be G, J, H, S, Y, Q, R. This order satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can start with the given conditions and eliminate the choices that do not fit with them.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means that J, G, and R must be edited in that order.
  S must be earlier than Y. This means that S and Y must be edited in that order.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. This means that we cannot have G and J next to each other, nor can we have Q and R next to each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. This means that Q must be edited third or later.
  If H is fourth, then the only remaining articles to edit are Q, R, S, and Y. However, we cannot have Q and R next to each other, so this is not a valid option.
  If H is sixth, then the only remaining articles to edit are G, J, and Y. However, we cannot have G and J next to each other, so this is not a valid option.
  If R is fourth, then the only remaining articles to edit are Q, S, Y, G, J, and H. We can edit them in the following order: Q, S, Y, G, J, H. This is a valid option.
  If R is seventh, then the only remaining articles to edit are Q, S, Y, G, J, and H. We can edit them in the following order: Q, S, Y, G, J, H. This is a valid option.
  If Y is fifth, then the only remaining articles to edit are Q, R, S, G, J, and H. We cannot have Q and R next to each other, so this is not a valid option.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is fourth or seventh.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - If H is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  - If H is sixth, we know that the three finance articles must come before it, but we don't know the order of the other three articles, so this doesn't fully determine the order either.
  - If R is fourth, we know that S must be first, Q must be third, and G must be fifth. We also know that J must be earlier than G, so J must be sixth and Y must be seventh. This fully determines the order.
  - If R is seventh, we know that Y must be fifth and S must be sixth. We also know that Q must be third, so G must be fourth and J must be second. This fully determines the order.
  - If Y is fifth, we know that S must be first and Q must be third. We also know that G must be fourth and J must be sixth. However, we don't know the order of the remaining two articles, so this doesn't fully determine the order.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D. We can eliminate C because it only partially determines the order, whereas D fully determines the order.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is first, then Q must be second and R must be third.
  If Q is first, then S must be fourth and R must be fifth.
  If R is first, then S must be fourth and Q must be fifth.
  If G is first, then J must be second and one of the finance articles must be third. The remaining finance article must be sixth, and Y must be seventh.
  If J is first, then G must be second and the finance articles must be third and fourth. One of the nutrition articles must be fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. Y must be seventh.
  If Q is first, then S must be fourth and R must be fifth. The finance articles must be second and third, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. Y must be seventh.
  If H is first, then one of the finance articles must be second and J must be third. G must be fourth, one of the nutrition articles must be fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. Y must be seventh.
  If Y is first, then S must be second and Q must be third. The finance articles must be fourth and fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. J must be seventh.
  If Y is second, then S must be first and Q must be third. The finance articles must be fourth and fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. J must be seventh.
  If Y is third, then S must be first and Q must be second. The finance articles must be fourth and fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. J must be seventh.
  If Y is fourth, then one of the finance articles must be first and J must be second. G must be third, one of the nutrition articles must be fifth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. Q must be seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then one of the finance articles must be first and J must be second. G must be third, one of the nutrition articles must be fourth, and the remaining nutrition article must be sixth. Q must be seventh.
  If Y is sixth, then one of the finance articles must be first and J must be second. G must be third, one of the nutrition articles must be fourth, and the remaining nutrition article must be fifth. Q must be seventh.
  If Y is seventh, then one of the finance articles must be first and J must be second. G must be third, one of the nutrition articles must be fourth, and the remaining nutrition article must be fifth. Q must be sixth.
  The only answer choice that fully determines the order in which the articles are edited is D: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We can start by identifying the articles that must be edited consecutively and those that cannot be edited consecutively. 
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J, G, and R must be edited consecutively in that order.
  Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance. Therefore, H cannot be edited consecutively with G or J.
  Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition. Therefore, Q cannot be edited consecutively with R or S.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, R, and S in that order.
  S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, Y must be edited last.
  Now, we can use the given options to determine the order of the articles.
  If H is fourth, then the order of the finance articles would be H, J, G. However, we cannot determine the order of the nutrition articles or the position of Y.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the finance articles would be J, G, H. The order of the nutrition articles would be Q, R, S. Y would be edited last. Therefore, the order of the articles is fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the finance articles would be J, G, R. However, we cannot determine the order of the nutrition articles or the position of Y.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the finance articles would be J, G, R. The order of the nutrition articles would be Q, S, R. However, we cannot determine the position of Y.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the finance articles would be J, G, R. The order of the nutrition articles would be Q, S, R. However, H can only be edited after G or J, so this option is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If H is fourth, we don't know which articles come before it.
  If H is sixth, we don't know which articles come before it.
  If R is fourth, we can determine the order of the articles.
  If R is seventh, we don't know which articles come before it.
  If Y is fifth, we don't know which articles come before it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some possibilities.
  If we can determine the position of one article, we can determine the order of the others.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know the positions of Q, R, S, or Y. We can't determine the order.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first. We also know that Y must be edited last. We can determine the order.
  C: If R is fourth, we don't know the positions of Q, S, G, H, or Y. We can't determine the order.
  D: If R is seventh, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first. We also know that Y must be edited last. We can determine the order.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that the three finance articles must be edited first. We also know that S must be edited before Q. We can determine the order.
  Therefore, the answer is either B, D, or E.
Action: Answer("B")

Response 0:
Thought:
  If G is on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F, H, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle shelf with I and M.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, F, and M.
  The answer is E: F, I, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must also be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the top shelf must contain only two books, which are G and one other book.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the middle shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is H, I, and O.
  The answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are only two books left to be placed on the top shelf.
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf if O is on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the top shelf, then M cannot be on the top shelf either.
  Therefore, the only possible list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least two books on the top shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there are at most two books on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, G is on the top shelf with one other book, and the remaining six books are on the middle and bottom shelves.
  The only answer choice that includes I as being on the middle shelf is E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: F, I, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are 6 books left to be placed on the bottom two shelves.
  Since there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, there must be at least 4 books on the bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so there are two books left to be placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M is on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K is either on the top shelf or the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O is either on the top shelf or the middle shelf.
  If K is on the top shelf, then O must be on the middle shelf.
  If K is on the middle shelf, then O can be on either the top shelf or the bottom shelf.
  If O is on the middle shelf, then L must be on the bottom shelf.
  If O is on the top shelf, then L can be on either the middle shelf or the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the possible books placed on the middle shelf are I and either K or O.
  The answer is either D: I, K, L or E: F, I, M.
Action: Answer("D") or Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O are placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they are both on the middle or bottom shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so at least four books are on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, F, H, and I are on the middle shelf, and L and O are on the bottom shelf.
  The answer is C: H, I, L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there are at least two books on the top shelf.
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there are more than two books on the bottom shelf.

  If I is placed on the middle shelf, then there are at least two books on the middle shelf.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K and M are not on the middle shelf.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, then L is not on the top shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then H cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible books on the middle shelf are I and L.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 5th and the mirror must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd or later.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must also be auctioned on June 2nd or later, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or later, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
  The only option that could be true is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and the vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, but we know that the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and the vase, so the table cannot be auctioned on June 5th.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but we know that the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and the vase, so the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  The only answer choice that could be true is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible because the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible because the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the mirror would have to be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible because the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the sundial would have to be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We are given that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  We know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  We know that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th because the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already being auctioned on the earliest possible date it can be auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already being auctioned on a later date than the lamp can be auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already being auctioned on a later date than the sundial can be auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the vase must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is being auctioned on a later date than the vase can be auctioned and the sundial is already being auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is being auctioned on a later date than the mirror can be auctioned and the vase is already being auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, because the table is already being auctioned on the earliest possible date.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, because the table is already being auctioned on a later date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, because the table is already being auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, because the table is being auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already being auctioned on the earliest possible date.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is being auctioned on a later date than the mirror and the vase, and the lamp must be auctioned on a later date than the mirror if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is being auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase because the table is being auctioned on a later date than both the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the only possible true statement is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  The only antiques left to be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th are the lamp and the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The answer is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and it is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd.
  The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if and only if the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Since the vase is auctioned on June 3rd, the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, and the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on the remaining days.
  Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so B is not true.
  The sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, so C is not true.
  The mirror is auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, so D is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, so the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.

Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to look for a statement that must be true based on the given rules.
  If a statement is not necessarily true, then it is not the answer.
  Statement A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.
  Statement B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug based on the given rules.
  Statement C is true because peach is used in any rug in which olive is used.
  Statement D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a rug with peach, but it can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement E is not necessarily true because yellow may not be used in any of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  To determine which statement must be true, we need to analyze the given rules.
  Rule 1: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  Rule 2: In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Rule 3: Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Rule 4: Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Rule 5: Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Since there are three rugs and five colors to be used, at least one rug must be multicolored.
  If forest is used in a multicolored rug, then two other colors must also be used in that rug. However, turquoise cannot be used with forest, so this means that forest can only be used in a solid-colored rug.
  If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, then two other colors must also be used in that rug. However, forest cannot be used with turquoise, so this means that turquoise can only be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Peach must be used in at least one rug because it is always used when olive is used.
  Yellow can be used in a multicolored rug because it is not restricted by any of the given rules.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to find a statement that must be true based on the given rules.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in either solid or multicolored rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in either solid or multicolored rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, then they can be used separately in either solid or multicolored rugs.
  We know that each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  From the given rules, we can deduce that white must be used in a multicolored rug, and olive must be used in a multicolored rug with peach.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  The answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  Statement A is not necessarily true since forest can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.

Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to check which statement must be true.
  We know that there are three rugs and five colors will be used.
  We also know that some colors cannot be used together.
  From the given rules, we can conclude that:
  - If white is used, two other colors are also used. So, white cannot be used alone.
  - If olive is used, peach must also be used.
  - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
  - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
  - Peach and yellow cannot be used together.
  From these rules, we can deduce that:
  - If forest is used, it must be a solid rug because it cannot be used with turquoise.
  - If olive is used, it must be used with peach and the third color must not be turquoise or forest.
  - If white is used, it must be used with two other colors, and those two colors cannot be peach and turquoise.
  - If peach is used, it must be used with olive and the third color must not be turquoise or forest.
  - If turquoise is used, it must be a solid rug because it cannot be used with forest and peach.
  - If yellow is used, it can be used with any color except peach.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that Peach is used in one of the rugs. Hence, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to check which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  Choice A is not necessarily true since forest can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.
  Choice B is true since turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  Choice C is true since peach is used in a rug where olive is used.
  Choice D is not necessarily true since turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  Choice E is not necessarily true since yellow may not be used in any of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  From the constraints, we know that the order of the lectures must be: 
  1. Farley's lecture
  2. Holden's lecture
  3. Garcia's lecture or Jiang's lecture
  4. Garcia's lecture or Jiang's lecture
  The order of the lectures is not specified, but we know that the lithographs lecture must be last.
  A: Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so this cannot be true.
  B: This is possible because it is not restricted by any of the constraints.
  C: This is possible because it is not restricted by any of the constraints.
  D: Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so this cannot be true.
  E: This is possible because it is not restricted by any of the constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Therefore, we can create a timeline based on the given constraints to determine which options are possible or impossible.
  The timeline is as follows:
  Farley -> Oil Paintings -> Watercolors -> Garcia/Jiang -> Lithographs
  A: Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  B: Garcia can give the sculptures lecture because the topic of the lecture is not specified in the constraints.
  C: Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture because the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, and Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture.
  D: Holden can give the oil paintings lecture because the topic of the lecture is not specified in the constraints.
  E: Jiang can give the watercolors lecture because the topic of the lecture is not specified in the constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the sculptures lecture, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, E can be true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the sculptures lecture, which violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is consistent with the given constraints. Therefore, E can be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  Choice A cannot be true because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture.
  Choice B can be true because there are no constraints that prevent Garcia from giving the sculptures lecture.
  Choice C cannot be true because the watercolors lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture, so Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  Choice D can be true because there are no constraints that prevent Holden from giving the oil paintings lecture.
  Choice E cannot be true because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, so Jiang cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.

Thought: 
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the sculptures lecture, which is already given.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is possible.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is already given.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.

Response 6:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic.
  Therefore, we can create a schedule of the lectures based on the given constraints.
  We can then check each choice to see if it violates any of the constraints.
  If a choice violates any of the constraints, then it cannot be true.
Schedule:
  1. Farley - Watercolors
  2. Holden - Sculptures
  3. Garcia - Lithographs
  4. Jiang - Oil Paintings
  Choice A violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Choice B is consistent with the schedule.
  Choice C is consistent with the schedule.
  Choice D violates the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Choice E is consistent with the schedule.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic.
  Therefore, there are only four possible orders for the lectures.
  We can eliminate the orders that violate the given constraints.
  The remaining order is the only possible order.
  We can then determine which of the choices cannot be true based on the remaining order.
  Farley's lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be second.
  Garcia's lecture must be third.
  Jiang's lecture must be last.
  Therefore, choice A cannot be true because Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture, which is the last lecture.

Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be later than the lithographs lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. But, we don't know the order of the other lectures, so this is possible.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. But, we don't know the order of the other lectures, so this is possible.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 6. Then, X must be mentioned in chapter 5, and U must be mentioned in chapter 4. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1, which satisfies the conditions.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 6. If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1, and T and W to be mentioned in chapters 3 and 5, respectively, which satisfies the conditions. If S is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5, and U must be mentioned in chapter 7. This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 1, and T and W to be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, respectively, which satisfies the conditions.
  Therefore, A, B, and D cannot be true. 
  C and E are possible. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W is mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 5, which means U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which is impossible because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 4, which means T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is impossible because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which means X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which means U must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is impossible because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which means X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which means U must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which means T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which means W must be mentioned in chapter 7, which means Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which means S must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or E.
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, respectively.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating them. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W in chapter 5.
  S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 because Z is mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be in chapter 6. Therefore, S must be in chapter 3.
  R cannot be in chapter 3 because S is already there. Therefore, R must be in chapter 4 or later.
  The only option that satisfies all the constraints is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 3, S could be mentioned in chapter 4, T could be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, U could not be mentioned in chapter 1, and X could be mentioned in chapter 5.
  The answer is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which means T and W will be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7, but not in chapter 6.
  If U and X are mentioned in adjacent chapters, then they must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3, or chapters 4 and 5, or chapters 5 and 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 2, which is not allowed.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which is allowed.
  Therefore, S could be mentioned in chapter 3 if Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, or in chapters 5 and 6.
  If S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  If T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then X must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Based on the above constraints, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, and R must be mentioned in chapter 3. This satisfies all the constraints.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5. If S is mentioned in chapter 1, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6. This satisfies all the constraints. If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6. This satisfies all the constraints.
  Therefore, A, B, and D cannot be true. C and E could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, which is not possible.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that S is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 6.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 2, and S must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5. This violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, A is not true.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then R must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and S must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, C could be true.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 4. This violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, D is not true.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2, and W must be mentioned in chapter 4. This satisfies all the constraints. Therefore, E could be true.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 6. 
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then X must be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 6.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 4, then X must be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, the possible scenarios are:
    1. T is mentioned in chapter 3, S is mentioned in chapter 6, U is mentioned in chapter 2, X is mentioned in chapter 3, and R is mentioned in chapter 4.
    2. T is mentioned in chapter 4, S is mentioned in chapter 2, U is mentioned in chapter 4, X is mentioned in chapter 5, and R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, the answer is either C: T is mentioned in chapter 4 or B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be only five students available for the project.
  The project requires four students, so one of the six students will not be assigned to the project.
  We need to determine which of the answer choices is possible given the conditions.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which violates the condition that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which violates the condition that if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, which violates the condition that if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921, which satisfies all the conditions.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to 1922, and Onyx must be assigned to 1921, which satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, both D and E are possible.
Action: Answer("D or E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the remaining year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the remaining year.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, there will be only one student available for the remaining year.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. But Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project if Ryan is not assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project. Then, Onyx must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Louis can be assigned to 1924.
  The only possible option is E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923, Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and either Ryan or Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be only five students available for the project.
  There are six students available for the project, so one student will not be assigned to any year.
  We need to check which of the answer choices can be true in this scenario.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there will be only five students available for the project, and the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" will not be satisfied. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project" will not be satisfied. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" will not be satisfied. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924. However, the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" will not be satisfied. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. However, the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923" will not be satisfied. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  Therefore, none of the answer choices can be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only 5 students available for the project.
  Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany are available for the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But Ryan must be assigned to the project if Tiffany is assigned to the project. This is a contradiction.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This is a contradiction.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. But Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is not assigned to the project. This is a contradiction.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. Tiffany must be assigned to the project if Ryan is assigned to the project. This is a contradiction.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan must be assigned to the project. But if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Ryan is not assigned to the project. This means that Onyx is not assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, and Louis must be assigned to the project. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis or Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to any of the four years.
  Therefore, Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany are the five students available for the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1921, 1922, or 1923.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any of the four years.
  Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, D: Onyx is assigned to 1922 could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Louis can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Ryan can be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Onyx can be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Yoshio is not assigned, then Mollie can be assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, Louis can be assigned to 1923, Ryan can be assigned to 1924, Onyx can be assigned to 1922, and Mollie can be assigned to 1921.
  This means that Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  The only option that could be true is C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, he cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Yoshio is not assigned to the project, so he cannot be assigned to any of the years.
  Therefore, Louis can be assigned to 1923.
  Ryan can be assigned to the project, and Onyx can be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Mollie can be assigned to the project and can be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Tiffany can be assigned to the project, and Louis can be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, all options are possible.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only 5 students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, there are only 3 years left for the remaining 3 students.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, there are only 2 students left for the remaining 2 years.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, there is only one year left for the remaining student.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project and Ryan must be assigned to the remaining year. This means that Onyx, Mollie, and Louis are assigned to the remaining years. Therefore, Yoshio is not assigned to the project and Louis is assigned to the project. So, A is not true.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project and the remaining year must be assigned to Onyx. This means that Mollie, Louis, and Ryan are assigned to the remaining years. Therefore, Yoshio is not assigned to the project and Ryan is assigned to the project. So, B is not true.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, C is true.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. This means that Tiffany, Mollie, and Louis are assigned to the remaining years. Therefore, Yoshio is not assigned to the project and Onyx is assigned to 1922. So, D is true.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project and Ryan must be assigned to 1923. This means that Onyx, Mollie, and Louis are assigned to the remaining years. Therefore, Yoshio is not assigned to the project and Louis is assigned to 1924. So, E is true.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only five students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, the remaining years must be assigned to Louis, Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1921.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then the remaining years must be assigned to Louis, Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx.
  Therefore, Louis can be assigned to 1923, and the answer is A: Louis is not assigned to the project.

  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house shown.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so the first five houses must be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate options A, B, and C.
  Option D shows K before L, which violates the rule that L must be shown after K.

  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  N must be shown before M, so N must be shown in the afternoon.
  0 and P can be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L must be shown in the afternoon, and 0 and P must be shown in the morning.
  The only option that follows these rules is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first house shown.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so the first five houses must be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  From the given choices, only option C satisfies all the given conditions.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be the third house shown, and M cannot be the fifth house shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so the first and second houses cannot be J or K.
  The only option that satisfies all the rules is option D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: [morning], [morning], K, L, M, N, J or [morning], [morning], K, L, M, P, J.
  The only answer choice that follows these rules is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is either the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or 0 is the first house to be shown.
  If K is the first house to be shown, then 0 cannot be shown in the morning, so 0 is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  If 0 is the first house to be shown, then K must be the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  P cannot be shown in the morning, so P is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  N is the only house left, so N is either the third, fourth, or fifth house to be shown.
  Therefore, the order in which the realtor shows the houses must be one of the following:
    1. K, N, L, M, 0, P, J
    2. 0, K, N, L, M, P, J
  The answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:

  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or the seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K, L, and M must be shown in the afternoon, and O and P must be shown in the morning.
  The order of the houses can be determined as follows:
  1. O or P (morning)
  2. The other of O or P (morning)
  3. K (afternoon)
  4. L (afternoon)
  5. M (afternoon)
  6. J (evening)

  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be the first or second house shown, and it cannot be the last house shown.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate options A and E.
  Option B shows L before K, which violates the rule that L must be shown after K.
  Option C shows K before L, which violates the rule that L must be shown after K.
  Option D satisfies all the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the 6th or 7th house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either K or L must be shown in the morning.
  N must be shown before J, so N must be the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th house shown.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, if M is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, if M is published in the fall, K cannot be published in the fall.
  The only remaining cookbooks are L and P.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  Therefore, if M is published in the fall, P cannot be published in the fall.
  This leaves L as the only remaining cookbook that can be published in the fall with M.
  Therefore, the answer is B: L and N.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
  P cannot be published in the same season as M.
  Hence, P must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then T must be performed immediately after F or immediately after R.
  If O is performed fifth, then T must be performed immediately before F or immediately before R.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, the possible compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If O is performed first, then the compositions performed first, second, and third could be P, R, and T or R, T, and F.
  - If O is performed fifth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third could be L, H, and F or H, F, and T.
  The only option that matches one of these possibilities is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that are performed before S are O, the first composition, and either F or R.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so one of them must be the last composition.
  From the given options, only option D: O, P, T satisfies the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  O is performed either first or fifth. If O is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  If O is performed fifth, then the order of the first three compositions must be F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H. If L or H is performed first, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and R or O, P, and T.
  P is performed at some time before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed first.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, if O is performed first, then S must be performed fifth or later. If O is performed fifth, then S must be performed first or fourth.
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be O, P, and T.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed before S.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the eighth composition performed cannot be F, O, P, R, or S.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R cannot be performed eighth.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F cannot be performed eighth.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth, and T must be performed immediately before F.
  The only choice that satisfies these conditions is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We are given several conditions that must be satisfied for the order of the compositions.
  If S is performed fourth, then O must be performed first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S, which means P cannot be performed first.
  If O is performed fifth, then T must be performed immediately after O, which means T cannot be performed eighth.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, which means P cannot be performed eighth.
  Therefore, the only possible order for the first three compositions is O, P, T.
  The answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We are given the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P is performed before S. Therefore, O cannot be performed first because there must be at least one composition performed after O and before S. So, O must be performed fifth. This means that L or H must be performed eighth. Also, since T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F, we can deduce that T must be performed immediately after R and F must be performed after the two compositions that are performed either after R and before F, or after F and before R. Therefore, the only possible list of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is H, P, and L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, O cannot be performed second or third.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, L or H must be performed seventh.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, T cannot be performed first or second.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, F and R must be performed third and sixth in some order.
  We know that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  Therefore, S cannot be performed first or second.
  We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they have O as the first composition performed.
  We can eliminate choice A because it has P as the third composition performed.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H, P, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  If P is performed first, then R must be performed second and T must be performed third.
  If P is performed second, then either R or T must be performed first and the other one must be performed third.
  If P is performed third, then either R or T must be performed first and the other one must be performed second.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  If P is performed second or third, then the eighth composition must be the one that was not performed first.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth.
  If P is performed second or third, then O must be performed either first or fifth.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then either F or R must be performed fourth, and the other one must be performed either sixth or seventh.
  If P is performed second or third, then either F or R must be performed either first or fifth, and the other one must be performed either sixth or seventh.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then T must be performed immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If P is performed second or third, then T must be performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and the other composition must be performed either immediately before or immediately after T.
  We also know that at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  Therefore, if P is performed first, then either S or one of the compositions after F and before R must be performed second, and the other one must be performed either sixth or seventh.
  If P is performed second or third, then either S or one of the compositions after F and before R must be performed either third or fourth, and the other one must be performed either sixth or seventh.
  We can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they violate the condition that O is performed either first or fifth.
  We can eliminate choice B because it violates the condition that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the answer is A: F, H, P. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

  If the shoe store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 1 or space 3.
  If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3.
  If the optometrist is in space 3, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 or space 4.
  If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the veterinarian must be in space 1, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 4, and the veterinarian must be in space 5.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so they cannot be in spaces 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 4 and 7.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  Therefore, the optometrist and the shoe store must occupy space 1 and space 2 in some order.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must occupy space 1 or space 7.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must occupy space 2 if the optometrist is in space 1, or space 6 if the optometrist is in space 2.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants cannot occupy space 2 and space 3.
  The pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot occupy space 2 if the toy store is in space 3, or space 6 if the toy store is in space 5.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot occupy space 2 if one of the restaurants is in space 7, or space 6 if one of the restaurants is in space 1.
  If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy is in space 2, and the veterinarian is in space 3 or space 4.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy is in space 6, and the veterinarian is in space 4 or space 5.
  In either case, the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store must occupy space 4.
  If the optometrist is in space 1, then the two restaurants must occupy space 5 and space 7 in some order.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the two restaurants must occupy space 1 and space 3 in some order.

  1. Optometrist is in space 2 and Shoe store is in space 3.
  2. Optometrist is in space 6 and Shoe store is in space 5.
  From the constraints, we know that the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in either space 1 or space 7. 
  Also, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, if the optometrist is in space 2, the pharmacy must be in space 1, and if the optometrist is in space 6, the pharmacy must be in space 7. 
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, if the optometrist is in space 2, the veterinarian cannot be in space 1, and if the optometrist is in space 6, the veterinarian cannot be in space 7.
  From the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, we know that the restaurant cannot be in space 2 or space 6.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
  - Optometrist in space 2 and Shoe store in space 3.
  - Pharmacy in space 1.
  - One of the restaurants in space 7.
  - The toy store cannot be in space 4 or space 6, so it must be in space 5.
  - The veterinarian cannot be in space 4 or space 6, so it must be in space 6.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the restaurant.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.

Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible scenarios:
  1. Optometrist is on the left of the shoe store.
  2. Optometrist is on the right of the shoe store.
  In the first scenario, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it must be on the left of the optometrist. Therefore, the pharmacy is in space 1 and the veterinarian is in space 2. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 3. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in spaces 4 and 6. The shoe store is in space 5. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  In the second scenario, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Since the pharmacy must be at one end of the row, it must be on the right of the optometrist. Therefore, the veterinarian is in space 7 and the pharmacy is in space 6. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 5. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 1. The shoe store is in space 2. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: the pharmacy and a restaurant or B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  Therefore, the optometrist and the shoe store must occupy spaces 2 and 3 in some order.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must occupy either space 1 or space 7.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian must be in space 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store cannot be in space 4 if the veterinarian is in space 3 or space 5.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants cannot occupy spaces 1-4 or spaces 4-7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the veterinarian.

  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 3, and the pharmacy must be in space 2.
  If the shoe store is in space 6, then the optometrist must be in space 5 or space 7.
  If the optometrist is in space 7, then the veterinarian must be in space 6, which is not possible since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 5, and the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the restaurant must be in space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 2.

  2. Optometrist and Shoe store are in spaces 6 and 7, respectively.
  
  In the first arrangement, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 7. If the pharmacy is in space 3, then the toy store must be in space 4 or 5, but this violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. This means that one of the restaurants must be in space 3, and the other restaurant must be in space 5 or 6. The toy store must be in space 4, and the veterinarian must be in space 1.
  
  In the second arrangement, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 5. If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the toy store must be in space 2 or 3, but this violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the first arrangement is not possible.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the second arrangement is not possible.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be next to the shoe store.

Response 9:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible arrangements: optometrist-shoe store-pharmacy or pharmacy-optometrist-shoe store.
  If optometrist-shoe store-pharmacy is the arrangement, then the pharmacy is at one end of the row and the restaurant is at the other end. Therefore, the two restaurants cannot be separated by at least two other businesses. So, this arrangement is not possible.
  Therefore, pharmacy-optometrist-shoe store must be the arrangement.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. So, the toy store must be in space 4.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1, 2, and 3 or spaces 5, 6, and 7.
  If the two restaurants are in spaces 1, 2, and 3, then the veterinarian is in space 6. So, the toy store is next to the restaurant in space 5. But this means that the toy store is next to the veterinarian, which is not possible. So, this arrangement is not possible.
  Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 5, 6, and 7. So, the answer is D: a restaurant and the toy store.

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies must be made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday or Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, (C) is a possible answer.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  Therefore, (C) is the only possible answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can deduce that the third batch of sugar cookies is not made on Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  The answer is B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can deduce that the other two batches of cookies must have been made on Monday through Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first and third batches of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday through Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first or second batch of sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, so it must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, so it must be made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, so it must be made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday, so it must be made on Wednesday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. However, this violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so this option is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

Thought:
  If there is only one batch made on Friday, then there must be at least one batch made on each of the other days.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on either Monday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday as well, which is not possible.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday as well, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on either Monday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  However, we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  However, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Tuesday, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  The only possible option is that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then there are two possibilities:
    1. One batch of oatmeal cookies, one batch of peanut butter cookies, and one batch of sugar cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, respectively. Then, on Friday, one batch of any kind of cookie is made.
    2. Two batches of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, respectively. Then, on Friday, one batch of sugar cookies is made.
  From the answer choices, we can see that (A) and (B) are not possible because no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  (C) is possible because it is not specified which kind of cookie is made for the one batch on Friday.
  (D) is not possible because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  (E) is not possible because the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that one batch of cookie is made on Friday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We need to find an option that satisfies all the above conditions and also satisfies the condition that one batch of cookie is made on Friday.
  Option A is not possible because the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
  Option B is not possible because the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  Option C is not possible because the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Option D is not possible because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday or Thursday.
  Option E is possible because the second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Thursday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies can be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

  If the veterinarian is next to the pharmacy, then the optometrist cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  If the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 2, then a restaurant must be in space 3 or space 5, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  If the optometrist or the veterinarian is in space 6, then a restaurant must be in space 3 or space 5, which satisfies the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.

  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2 or 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  If the pharmacy is in space 2, then the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 3 and 4 because they would not be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  If the toy store is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2, which violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  If the toy store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 6, which satisfies the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy is in space 6 and the optometrist is in space 7.
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the veterinarian must be in space 3 and the toy store must be in space 1.
  Therefore, a restaurant is next to the toy store.
  The optometrist is not next to a restaurant because the two restaurants are in spaces 3 and 5.
  The pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian because the pharmacy is in space 6 and the veterinarian is in space 3.
  The shoe store is not next to the toy store because the veterinarian is in space 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7.
  If the two restaurants are in spaces 1 and 7, then the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist in space 3 or next to the veterinarian in space 5.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  If the pharmacy is in space 2 or 6, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 3 or 5, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 5.
  If the pharmacy is in space 3, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 5.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 3.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 1.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 2 or 6.
  If the toy store is in space 2, then a restaurant must be in space 3, which is not possible.

Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we know that the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  Also, we know that the restaurant cannot be in space 1 or 7.
  Therefore, the pharmacy and the restaurant must be in spaces 2, 3, 5, and 6.
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the only possible arrangement is:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist or veterinarian], [restaurant], [toy store], [shoe store], [restaurant], [veterinarian or optometrist]
  If the pharmacy is next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, then the veterinarian or the optometrist must be in space 2 or 6.
  If the toy store is in space 3, then the restaurant must be in space 5.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [restaurant], [toy store], [shoe store], [restaurant], [veterinarian]

Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then it cannot be used in the multicolored rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only two colors that are used in the multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then it must be used with two other colors.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then it cannot be used with another color that cannot be used together.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then it cannot be used with another color that cannot be used together with it.
  The colors that cannot be used together are forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only three colors that can be used in the solid rugs.
  The colors that can be used in the solid rugs are forest, olive, and yellow.
  If the solid rugs are forest and peach, then the multicolored rug must use olive, turquoise, and yellow.
  If the solid rugs are forest and yellow, then the multicolored rug must use olive, peach, and turquoise.
  If the solid rugs are peach and turquoise, then the multicolored rug must use forest, olive, and yellow.
  If the solid rugs are peach and yellow, then the multicolored rug must use forest, olive, and turquoise.
  If the solid rugs are turquoise and yellow, then the multicolored rug must use forest, olive, and peach.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of them must have two colors.
  If forest is used in one of the solid rugs, then it cannot be used in the other solid rug or the multicolored rug.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then it cannot be used in the other solid rug or the multicolored rug.
  If yellow is used in the multicolored rug, then it cannot be used in the solid rugs.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, or peach and yellow.
  The answer is A: forest and peach, and D: peach and yellow.
Action: Answer("A and D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  There are exactly two solid rugs.
  In a solid rug, only one color is used.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, it cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in a multicolored rug, it cannot be used in another multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in a multicolored rug, it must be used with at least two other colors.
  From the given rules, we can deduce the following:
    - If white is used, it must be used with two other colors.
    - If olive is used, it must be used with peach.
    - Forest and turquoise cannot be used together.
    - Peach and turquoise cannot be used together.
    - Peach and yellow cannot be used together.
  Let's try to find the colors that cannot be used in solid rugs.
  If forest is used in a solid rug, then none of the other colors used in the rug can be used in another solid rug. This means that peach and yellow cannot be used in a solid rug because they are both used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, A and B are possible color combinations for solid rugs.
  If peach is used in a solid rug, then olive cannot be used in a multicolored rug because it must be used with peach. This means that forest and yellow cannot be used in a solid rug because they are both used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, A and D are possible color combinations for solid rugs.
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then peach cannot be used in a multicolored rug because they cannot be used together. This means that olive and yellow cannot be used in a solid rug because they are both used in a multicolored rug. Therefore, E is a possible color combination for solid rugs.
  Thus, the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be C: peach and turquoise. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  If the third rug is multicolored, then it must contain at least three colors.
  If a rug is solid, then it is woven in a single color.
  If a rug is multicolored, then it is woven in more than one color.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the six colors must be used in exactly one rug.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then it is not used in the multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in the multicolored rug, then it is not used in either of the solid rugs.
  If a color is used in a solid rug, then the other color used in that rug cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  If a color is not used in a solid rug, then it must be used in the multicolored rug.
  If a color is used in the multicolored rug, then the other colors used in that rug cannot be used in either of the solid rugs.
  Using these rules, we can eliminate some choices:
    - Choice A: forest and peach can be used in different solid rugs, so it is not the answer.
    - Choice C: peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the same solid rug, so it is not the answer.
    - Choice D: peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be used in the same solid rug, so it is not the answer.
    - Choice E: turquoise and yellow can be used in different solid rugs, so it is not the answer.
  Therefore, the answer is B: forest and yellow.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only two rugs that have white and olive.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only two rugs that have white and peach.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only two rugs that have olive and peach.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there are only two rugs that have olive and white.

  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the solid rugs must have exactly one color.
  We can eliminate the answer choices that include peach because peach must be used in a multicolored rug.
  We can eliminate the answer choices that include turquoise because turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach.
  We are left with answer choices A, B, and E.
  If forest is used in a solid rug, then the other solid rug must be yellow because forest cannot be used with turquoise.
  If yellow is used in a solid rug, then the other solid rug cannot be forest because forest can be used with olive, which requires peach.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and yellow.
  The answer is B: forest and yellow.

  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain four colors.
  Let's try to find a combination of solid rugs that violate the given rules.
  If forest and peach are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain olive, turquoise, white, and yellow. This violates the rule that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  If forest and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain olive, peach, turquoise, and white. This satisfies all the rules.
  If peach and turquoise are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain forest, olive, white, and yellow. This satisfies all the rules.
  If peach and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain forest, olive, turquoise, and white. This satisfies all the rules.
  If turquoise and yellow are used in the solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain forest, olive, peach, and white. This satisfies all the rules.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs that cannot be used are forest and peach, and the answer is A: forest and peach.

  If Taylor is selected, then Smith must also be a project member. Therefore, if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader.
  If Xue is selected, then Smith must also be a project member. Therefore, if neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma could be the project leader.
  If Ruiz is selected, then Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, if neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader.
  If Verma is not a project member, then Verma cannot be the project leader.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, the project members must be chosen from the other four workers: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Wells.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  This means that the project members must be chosen from Quinn, Smith, and Taylor.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Therefore, the only option where Verma could be the project leader is if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  The answer is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.

Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Wells nor Ruiz can be project members.
If Verma is the project leader, then Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
If Verma is the project leader, then Smith must also be a project member.
Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Taylor must be a project member.
Thus, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Wells nor Ruiz can be project members, and Taylor must be a project member.
The only choice that satisfies these conditions is B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.

  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, Wells must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Therefore, Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, Ruiz cannot be a project member.
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Xue must be the third project member.
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader.
  If Verma could be the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, Answer("B") is true: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.

  Therefore, Jaramillo cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, because Kayne has to be assigned to Yemen if he is assigned to any of the three countries.
  If Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship, then Novetzke is not assigned to any of the three countries.

Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so they could perform the third solo.
  B: The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player could perform the third solo.
  C: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist could perform the third solo.
  D: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the trumpeter could perform the third solo.
  E: The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the violinist could not perform the third solo.
  Therefore, the answer is E: violinist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We need to determine who can perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the first or second solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. Therefore, the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. Therefore, the keyboard player can perform the third solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the guitarist can perform the first, second, or fifth solo.
  The remaining soloists are the trumpeter and the violinist.
  The saxophonist cannot perform the first or second solo, so the remaining soloists for those solos are the trumpeter and the violinist.
  Therefore, the only solo that cannot be performed by the keyboard player, saxophonist, percussionist, or guitarist is the fourth solo, which must be performed by either the trumpeter or the violinist.
  The answer is D: trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The answer is A: guitarist.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, then the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  If the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, then the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  If the keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist, then the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  If the saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, then the saxophonist must perform either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  Therefore, the only person who cannot perform the third solo is the violinist because the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We need to determine who cannot perform the third solo.
  Let's start with the saxophonist. If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, then the percussionist must perform first. But if the saxophonist performs after the trumpeter, then the trumpeter must perform first. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform third.
  The answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Since the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, then the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo. This means that the keyboard player must perform either the second, third, or fourth solo. But the keyboard player cannot perform the fourth solo because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo. 
  If the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does, then the trumpeter must perform either the first or second solo. This means that the keyboard player must perform either the third, fourth, or fifth solo. But the keyboard player cannot perform the fourth solo because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the third or fifth solo.
  Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the violinist.
  The answer is E: violinist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:

  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We need to determine who can perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs before the trumpeter.
  If the percussionist performs before the trumpeter, then the keyboard player must perform after the violinist and before the guitarist. In this case, the possible order of solos is: violinist, percussionist, saxophonist, keyboard player, trumpeter, and guitarist.
  Therefore, the answer is D: trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does, so the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does, so the keyboard player must perform either the second or third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both, so the saxophonist must perform either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  Therefore, the violinist must perform either the first, fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  If the violinist performs the third solo, then the keyboard player must perform the second solo, and the guitarist must perform the first solo. 
  However, this violates the condition that the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the violinist CANNOT perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The third solo cannot be performed by the guitarist, the keyboard player, or the violinist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist can perform the third solo only if the percussionist or the trumpeter performs their solo before the third solo.
  Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the saxophonist because the percussionist and the trumpeter can perform their solos before the third solo.
  The answer is C: saxophonist.

  We know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition cannot be the first audition.
  Therefore, the first audition must be either Kammer's audition or Zinn's audition.
  If the first audition is Kammer's audition, then the second audition must be Trillo's audition, and the third audition must be Waite's audition. Then, the fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Lugo's audition or Zinn's audition. Then, the sixth audition must be Yoshida's audition. Therefore, the answer is E: Zinn's audition.

  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Trillo's audition cannot be the fourth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition must be the fifth or sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  Therefore, the possible order of auditions is: Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Yoshida, Lugo, Trillo or Waite, Kammer, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida, Trillo.
  The sixth audition in the first possible order is Trillo's audition.
  The sixth audition in the second possible order is Trillo's audition.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Trillo's audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded, and Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition. 
  We also know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition must be either the first or second audition. 
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition. 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Trillo's audition or Zinn's audition. 
  If Trillo's audition is the fourth audition, then the order of auditions would be: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida, Zinn. This would mean that Zinn's audition is the sixth audition. 
  If Zinn's audition is the fourth audition, then the order of auditions would be: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Zinn, Yoshida, Trillo. This would mean that Trillo's audition is the sixth audition. 
  Therefore, the sixth audition could be either Trillo's audition or Zinn's audition. 
  The answer is either C: Trillo's audition or E: Zinn's audition.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded, so it cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the only option left is Zinn's audition.

  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes must be paired with a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Thus, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")

  Therefore, either Fuentes or Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.

  Therefore, the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  If Gagnon has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Metro section and one photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.

  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Since each section must have two photographs, the two photographs in the Metro section must be by Gagnon and Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so the two photographs in the Sports section must be by Hue and Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  Therefore, there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, there are no photographs in the Sports section by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, there are no photographs in the Sports section by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes.
  Since there are no photographs in the Sports section by Hue and Gagnon, both photographs in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The other photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue or Fuentes.

  Therefore, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Fuentes has one photograph in the Metro section, then Hue must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  If Fuentes has two photographs in the Metro section, then Hue must have two photographs in the Sports section.
  If Fuentes has three photographs in the Metro section, then Hue must have three photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, we cannot determine how many photographs Hue has in the Sports section.
  The answer must be either A, B, or D.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there are no photographs by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible schedules for the week:
  Schedule 1: Monday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Tuesday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Thursday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Friday - sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter.
  Schedule 2: Monday - oatmeal, peanut butter, sugar; Tuesday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Thursday - oatmeal, sugar, peanut butter; Friday - sugar, oatmeal, peanut butter.
  In Schedule 1, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  In Schedule 2, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the only possible answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for Wednesday's batches: no batches are made or one batch is made.
  If no batches are made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches made on either Tuesday or Thursday to make a total of nine batches for the week.
  If one batch is made on Wednesday, then there must be three batches made on either Tuesday or Thursday to make a total of nine batches for the week.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they must be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so if three batches are made on Thursday, then no batches can be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the batches of cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  In either case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are two possibilities: either three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and no batches are made on Wednesday, or three batches of cookies are made on Thursday and no batches are made on Wednesday.
  If three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then one batch of each kind of cookie must be made on Tuesday. This means that no batches of oatmeal cookies can be made on Monday, which contradicts the fact that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, three batches of cookies are made on Thursday, and no batches are made on Wednesday. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, along with the second batch of sugar cookies. The second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. This means that B is true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two options for Wednesday's cookies: 1) no cookies are made, or 2) one batch of cookies is made, which cannot be oatmeal, peanut butter, or sugar.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This would mean that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Thursday and Friday, so B is true.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This would mean that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday, so D is true.
  Therefore, either B or D must be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the oatmeal cookies and the peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the oatmeal cookies and the peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  If the oatmeal cookies and the peanut butter cookies are not made on Wednesday, then the sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  Since exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, and we know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the oatmeal cookies and the peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday and Tuesday.
  We also know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible days for the third batch of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: one batch of oatmeal and one batch of sugar, or two batches of oatmeal.
  If there are two batches of oatmeal cookies on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If there is only one batch of oatmeal cookies on Wednesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that there are two batches of oatmeal cookies on Wednesday.
  This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday. This leaves only one batch of cookies to be made on Friday, which must be peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.
  The answer is C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  No batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday or Thursday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, which means the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday or Friday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, which means the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible scenarios for the batches of cookies made on Wednesday: either no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, or only one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies must be made on another day to make a total of nine batches of cookies for the week.
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there must be two batches of cookies made on another day to make a total of nine batches of cookies for the week.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, no batches of sugar cookies can be made on Wednesday since only one batch of cookies can be made on Wednesday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies must be made on another day. The only day that has only one batch of cookies is Friday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then two batches of cookies must be made on another day. The only day that has two batches of cookies is Tuesday. Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, either A or B must be true.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator, and Olga and Juana are assigned to different teams.
  Therefore, Juana is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible scenarios: 
    Scenario 1: Olga and Mei are on the green team, and Juana and Kelly are on the red team.
      In this scenario, Lateefah is on the green team and is not a facilitator. Therefore, Lateefah is not a facilitator.
    Scenario 2: Olga and Mei are on the red team, and Juana and Kelly are on the green team.
      In this scenario, Lateefah is on the green team and is a facilitator. Therefore, Lateefah is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Lateefah is either not a facilitator (Scenario 1) or is a facilitator (Scenario 2).
  Juana is not a facilitator, but Mei could be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only answer choice that must be true is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams, so the other three members must be on the red team.
  Olga is a facilitator and is assigned to the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga, so Juana is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so Mei must be the facilitator on the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, and the answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team with Lateefah and Olga, and red team with Juana, Kelly, and Mei; or red team with Lateefah and Olga, and green team with Juana, Kelly, and Mei.
  In the first configuration, Olga is assigned to the green team and Juana is assigned to the red team, so A is true.
  In the second configuration, Olga is assigned to the red team and Juana is assigned to the green team, so C is true.
  Therefore, either A or C must be true.
Action: Answer("A or C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator. 
  Olga is a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  The green team must have Lateefah and a facilitator, and the red team must have Olga and a facilitator.
  There are only two facilitators, one on each team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei must be on the red team, and Kelly must be on the green team.
  The answer must be D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, Lateefah is on the same team as one of the facilitators.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the same team as Lateefah, which is the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Mei must be the other facilitator on the red team.
  This means that Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only statement that must be true is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, Lateefah is not assigned to the red team.
  Olga is assigned to a team with two members and is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Kelly is assigned to the green team.
  The green team has three members, including Lateefah, and one of them is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  Mei is assigned to the red team and there are only two members.
  Therefore, Mei is a facilitator.
  Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (facilitators: Lateefah and Olga) and red team (facilitator: Olga).
  Juana can be assigned to either team.
  Mei can be assigned to either team.
  If Juana is a facilitator, then Mei must be assigned to the other team.
  If Mei is a facilitator, then Juana must be assigned to the other team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are only two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei must be assigned to the same team.
  If Juana and Mei are both facilitators, then there will be two facilitators in one team, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei cannot both be facilitators.
  The only option that satisfies all the given conditions is that Juana is assigned to the red team, Lateefah is a member of the green team, Olga is assigned to the green team as a facilitator, and neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, Lateefah is not on the same team as Olga.
  Olga is a facilitator, but Kelly is not.
  Therefore, Olga is on the same team as either Juana or Mei.
  If Olga is on the green team, then Juana must be on the red team and vice versa.
  If Juana is a facilitator, then Mei cannot be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only answer choice that must be true is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  So, the team with Lateefah has three members.
  Olga is a facilitator, and there is only one facilitator per team.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the team with two members, which is the red team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  So, Juana is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Kelly is assigned to the green team.
  Mei is assigned to the red team and there is only one facilitator per team.
  Therefore, Mei is not a facilitator.
  So, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only option that must be true is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.

The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is
Response 0:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening and K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible since J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown at some time before M is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible since J must be shown in the evening and P can be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible since there are only seven houses to be shown and N and O are not part of the given houses.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is not possible since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because K cannot be shown in the morning and J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible because J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown at some time after K is shown.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible because J must be shown in the evening and P can be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible because there are only seven houses to be shown and N and O are not among them.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is possible because K can be shown in the afternoon and N and P can be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house to be shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  If K is shown in the afternoon, then L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  If K is shown in the evening, then L must be shown in the evening.
  P is the last house to be shown, so it must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, P cannot be shown at some time after J is shown.
  N cannot be shown at some time after M is shown because it is not one of the seven houses to be shown.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J is the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be J, _, _, L, _, M, P or J, _, _, L, M, _, P.
  A: K cannot be shown after J, so this is not possible.
  B: L must be shown after K, so this is possible.
  C: P can only be shown after M, so this is not possible.
  D: Both N and O are not mentioned, so this is not possible.
  E: Both N and P can only be shown after M, so this is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so J cannot be the first or second house to be shown.
  Therefore, J must be the sixth or seventh house to be shown.
  From the rules, we can conclude that:
  - K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  - L must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  - M must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  - N and O must be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  - P must be shown in the morning or evening.
  From the above conclusions, we can eliminate choices A, B, and C because they violate the rules.
  For choice D, it is possible for both N and O to be shown at some time after M is shown because N and O can be the first and second houses to be shown in the morning, and M can be the fifth house to be shown in the afternoon.
  For choice E, it is possible for both N and P to be shown at some time after K is shown because N and P can be the first and second houses to be shown in the afternoon, and K can be the third house to be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the answer is either D or E.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  If K is shown in the afternoon, then L must also be shown in the afternoon, which means M must be shown in the evening. This leaves N, O, and P to be shown in the morning, which means J cannot be shown in the evening as required.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the evening, which means L must also be shown in the evening and M must be shown in the afternoon.
  This leaves J, N, O, and P to be shown in the morning, and any of them could be shown after K.
  Therefore, A, C, and E could be true.
  D is not possible because both N and O cannot be shown after M since there are only two houses to be shown in the evening.
  B is not possible because L must be shown after K, which means L cannot be shown before J.
  The answer is either A, C, or E.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. - This is not possible since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. - This is not possible since J must be shown in the evening.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. - This is possible since J can be shown in the morning and P can be shown in the evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. - This is not possible since there are only seven houses to be shown.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. - This is not possible since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the answer is C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.

  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  A: K cannot be shown in the morning if J is shown in the evening. Therefore, K cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. A is false.
  B: L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. J cannot be shown before L because J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, L must be shown at some time after J is shown. B is true.
  C: J must be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown at some time after J is shown. C is false.
  D: M must be shown before N and O. Therefore, N and O cannot be shown at some time after M is shown. D is false.

  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  P is the only house that has not been mentioned in any of the rules.
  A cannot be true because K cannot be shown in the morning and J must be shown in the evening.
  B can be true because L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L could be shown after J is shown.
  C cannot be true because J must be shown in the evening and P is not mentioned in any of the rules.
  D cannot be true because it is not possible for both N and O to be shown after M is shown because there are only seven houses to be shown during a single day.
  E can be true because both N and P are not mentioned in any of the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or E.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the rules given to determine which answer option is possible.
  J must be shown in the evening, so it cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, J cannot be one of the first two houses to be shown.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible because L can be shown in the afternoon or evening after J is shown in the evening.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible because P can be shown in the afternoon or evening after J is shown in the evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible because there are only two houses left to show after M, and they must be shown in the evening.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is possible because K can be shown in the afternoon or evening, and N and P can be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.

### Temperature: 3.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade one class 2 building for one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings to get rid of the class 2 building.
  Southco only owns one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp to get a second class 2 building.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, RealProp does not own a class 1 building.
  The Garza Tower is the only class 1 building owned by any of the companies.
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House.
  The answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To get rid of class 2 buildings, Trustcorp can either trade them for class 3 buildings or trade them for a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will own at least one class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building with Southco.
  The only option for Trustcorp is to trade the Meyer Building (class 2) with Southco for the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  After this trade, Trustcorp will own only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (Garza Tower) and two class 3 buildings (Yates House and Zimmer House).
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building (Lynch Building).
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower with Trustcorp for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  After this trade, Trustcorp will own the Meyer Building, RealProp will own the King Building and the Ortiz Building, and Southco will own the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, RealProp owns no class 1 building.
  The answer is NOT A.
  Southco owns two buildings, one class 1 and one class 2.
  Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings.
  The answer is NOT B.
  Southco made a trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C.
  Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  The answer is NOT D.
  Trustcorp does not own the Zimmer House.
  The answer is E.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building or the Meyer Building, then Trustcorp will own a class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade the Ortiz Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp will own only one class 1 building and two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp must trade one of its class 3 buildings for a class 1 building.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Southco must trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade with Trustcorp.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some trades, it must have traded both the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp still owns the King Building.
  RealProp must own the Garza Tower.
  Southco must own the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  The answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only own class 3 buildings after some number of trades.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings for one of RealProp's class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco did not trade any of its class 2 buildings with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded one of its class 2 buildings with RealProp.
  RealProp owns only one class 2 building, the Yates House.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded the Yates House with Southco.
  Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building, the Garza Tower.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that involves class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, which is the Lynch Building.
  Southco has not traded any of its buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco has not made any trades with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then Trustcorp has traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must own at least one class 3 building.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings and one class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings.
  Southco could have traded its class 2 building with Trustcorp for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco may have made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp owns only class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower or the Zimmer House.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp no longer owns any class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp traded a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, then either RealProp or Southco must have traded a class 3 building for a class 2 building.
  If RealProp traded a class 3 building for a class 2 building, then RealProp must have a class 1 building to trade for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is the only trade that can result in Trustcorp owning no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp has made at least one trade of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 1 and class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco has not traded with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade a class 2 building, Trustcorp must receive two class 3 buildings in return.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp trades a class 2 building with RealProp, Trustcorp will own a class 3 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building with Southco, Trustcorp will own a class 1 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building with RealProp to own a class 3 building.
  RealProp must trade a class 3 building with Trustcorp to own a class 2 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Yates House with Trustcorp to own a class 2 building.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower with Southco to own two class 2 buildings.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, Southco must trade the Flores Tower with RealProp to own two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 2 buildings after the trades.

Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot three.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one.
  If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Zircon must perform in slot four, which is not possible.
  If Zircon performs in slot two, then Uneasy must perform in slot four, which is not possible.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Uneasy must perform in slot six.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot one, two, or three.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one, two, or three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot three.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four or five.
  The only option that could be true is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Wellspring must perform in slot four and Zircon must perform in slot five.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite must perform in slot three.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two and Wellspring performs in slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot five or slot six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one or slot two.
  Since Wellspring performs in slot one, Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot two.
  The only possible option is that Uneasy performs in slot six.
  The answer is A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
Action: Answer("A")

Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two in some order.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot three or earlier.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the first four slots must be either Wellspring, Zircon, Vegemite, Xpert or Zircon, Wellspring, Vegemite, Xpert.
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five. This is not possible because Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six. So, this choice is not true.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three. This is possible because Vegemite can perform in slot three or earlier. So, this choice could be true.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three. This is not possible because if Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which means that Vegemite cannot perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. So, this choice is not true.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two. This is possible because if Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one and Vegemite must perform in slot three or earlier. So, this choice could be true.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four. This is not possible because if Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot three, which means that Zircon cannot perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. So, this choice is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Vegemite performs in slot three or D: Zircon performs in slot two.

  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot five or slot six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one or slot two.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands is: Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite, Yardsign, and Uneasy.
  The only option that could be true is A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot six.
  Also, Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six either.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring must perform in slot two or slot three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot one, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot three, and Zircon must perform in slot two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Uneasy performs in slot five.

Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the slots is either Wellspring, Xpert or Xpert, Wellspring.
  According to the constraints, Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Wellspring performs before Xpert, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, the only possible option is if Vegemite performs in slot three.
  The answer is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands must be Wellspring followed by Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, Wellspring must perform in slot five.
  The order of the first four slots must be Vegemite, Yardsign, Wellspring, and Zircon (in some order).
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Zircon cannot perform in slot two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  The only option that could be true is Zircon performs in slot four.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one and two in some order, and Xpert must perform in slot three.
  Yardsign must perform in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot one or slot two.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot four or slot five, which violates the constraint that Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Vegemite.
  If Uneasy performs in slot five, then Zircon must perform in slot six, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one and Xpert must perform in slot three, which satisfies all the constraints.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot one or slot two, which violates the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Zircon performs in slot two.

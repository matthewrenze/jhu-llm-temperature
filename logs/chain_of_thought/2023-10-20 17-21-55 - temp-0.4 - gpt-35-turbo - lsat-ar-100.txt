### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three students review Undulation.
  Therefore, the other two students must have reviewed the same play or plays.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the third student who reviewed Undulation must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must have reviewed all three plays.
  If Megregian reviewed all three plays, then O'Neill must have reviewed Tamerlane and Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill did not review Sunset.
  Therefore, the answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they cannot be part of the three students who review Undulation.
  Therefore, the students who review Undulation are Jiang, Megregian, and Lopez.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, A and C are not true.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so O'Neill cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, B is true.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other, so the two students who review Tamerlane must review the same play as one of the students who review Undulation.
  Therefore, D and E are not true.
  The answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must not review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the two students who reviewed the same play must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must not review the play that the two students who reviewed the same play reviewed.
  If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then the other two students who reviewed the same play would have to be Kramer and O'Neill, but that would mean that Lopez reviewed more plays than Megregian, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation.
  If O'Neill did not review Undulation, then the two students who reviewed the same play would have to be Jiang and Lopez, but that would mean that Megregian reviewed more plays than Lopez, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, O'Neill reviews Undulation.
  The only student who has not been assigned a play yet is Jiang.
  Jiang cannot review Undulation, so Jiang must review Sunset.
  Lopez cannot review Tamerlane, so D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane is false.
  The only remaining answer choice is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then the three students who review Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian. This means that Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, and Jiang does not review Tamerlane. This satisfies all of the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation is either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so if Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, so neither Kramer nor Lopez review Undulation.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he must review Sunset.
  Therefore, the statement that could be true is E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Exactly three of the students review Undulation.
  Therefore, the other two students review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the student who is not reviewing Tamerlane is either Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, if Jiang reviews Undulation, neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must review Sunset too, which violates the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, O'Neill does not review Sunset.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Lopez and Jiang cannot review Undulation either. This means that all three of them must review Tamerlane, which violates the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, Megregian reviews Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill reviews Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviews Undulation, then Kramer must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
  Therefore, Jiang reviews Tamerlane.
  If Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then Lopez reviews Sunset.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the third student who reviews Undulation must be either Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Kramer and Lopez must review Tamerlane and O'Neill must review Sunset. But this would mean that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Undulation.
  O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so he cannot review Undulation. 
  Jiang cannot review Undulation. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  The answer is D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Exactly three students review Undulation.
  Therefore, the other two students cannot review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation must not review Tamerlane.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then Megregian must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then O'Neill must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Megregian cannot review Undulation.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian must review Sunset.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Megregian must review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three students review Undulation.
  Therefore, the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the student who does not review Tamerlane must be one of the three who reviews Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then he must review Tamerlane along with Kramer and O'Neill. This means that Lopez is the only one who reviews Sunset, which violates the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then he must review Sunset along with Lopez. This means that Megregian, Kramer, and Jiang review Tamerlane, which satisfies all the given conditions.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review it. This means that Lopez and Megregian must review Tamerlane along with Kramer and O'Neill. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Megregian cannot review Tamerlane. This means that Megregian must review Undulation along with two others. However, neither Jiang nor Lopez can review Undulation, which violates the given conditions.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Lopez must review Tamerlane along with Megregian, Kramer, and O'Neill. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Undulation cannot be Kramer or O'Neill.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, if exactly three of the students review Undulation, Megregian does not review Undulation.
  The question asks which one of the following could be true, so we need to select the answer choice that is consistent with this reasoning.

  Therefore, the target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is C: a 2-day website target.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- There are six targets in total, so each target can be assigned to two clients.
- A 1-day website target cannot be assigned to both Solide and Truvest since Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- A 2-day voicemail target cannot be assigned to both Image and either Solide or Truvest since Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- A 2-day website target can be assigned to both Solide and Truvest since there is no conflict.
- A 3-day voicemail target can be assigned to both Image and either Solide or Truvest since there is no conflict.
- A 3-day website target can be assigned to both Image and either Solide or Truvest since there is no conflict.
- Therefore, the target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is A: a 1-day website target.

  We need to determine which target can only be set for one client.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  A 1-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target.
Action: Answer("C")

  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are 1 day, 2 days, or 3 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  The target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients must violate one of the conditions above.
  A 1-day website target can be set for more than one of the clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, the answer is E: a 3-day website target.

    - Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 1-day website target cannot be set for Solide or Truvest because their voicemail targets would have to be shorter than 1 day, which is not possible.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all clients because it is longer than the shortest possible target (1 day) and shorter than the longest possible target (3 days).
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Truvest because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all clients because it is longer than the shortest possible target (1 day) and shorter than the longest possible target (3 days).

  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  A 3-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, or Truvest.
  Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target, which can only be set for Solide or Truvest, but not for Image.
  The answer is C: a 2-day website target.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:

  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The targets are set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that Image's voicemail target cannot be 3 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that the website target for Truvest cannot be 1 day.
  Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 1-day website target.
  The answer is A: a 1-day website target.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  There are three possible targets: 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day.
  Two targets are set for each client, one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  If a target is set for one client, it cannot be set for another client if it violates any of the conditions.
  Therefore, we need to check each target to see if it violates any of the conditions.
  A 1-day website target can be set for all clients because it is the shortest target.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all clients because it is not the shortest or longest target.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Image because it violates the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for Image because it violates the condition that Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for Solide because it violates the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is E: a 3-day website target.

  There are three different service targets: 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
  The question asks which target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
  If a target is set for more than one client, it must satisfy the conditions for both clients.
  A 1-day website target cannot be set for Image because its voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 2-day voicemail target cannot be set for Solide because Truvest's website target must be shorter than Solide's website target.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make only one trade, two companies must trade one building each.
  The class of the buildings must match the rules of the three kinds of trades.
  The only possible trade is between RealProp and Southco.
  RealProp can trade Garza Tower (class 1) for Flores Tower (class 1).
  Therefore, RealProp will own Flores Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco will own Garza Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp will own King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trade can only be made between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes as specified in the question.
  Therefore, we need to check each option to see if the trades are valid and can be made.
  Option A is not valid because RealProp is trading a class 1 building for another class 1 building, which is not allowed.
  Option B is not valid because RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Option C is valid because RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 3 buildings, which is allowed.
  Option D is not valid because RealProp is trading a class 1 building for two class 3 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Option E is not valid because RealProp is trading a class 1 building for another class 1 building, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  One trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  In order to make a valid trade, the companies must trade a building for another building of the same class, or a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Let's analyze each option:
    Option A: RealProp has a class 1 building and a class 3 building, but they need to trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building. Southco has only one class 2 building, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Therefore, option A is not possible.
    Option B: RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, but they need to trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building. Southco has only one class 2 building, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Therefore, option B is not possible.
    Option C: RealProp has a class 1 building and a class 3 building, and they can trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings from Trustcorp. Southco has a class 2 building that can be traded for two class 3 buildings from RealProp. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so they cannot make any trade. Therefore, option C is possible.
    Option D: RealProp has a class 1 building and a class 3 building, but they need to trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building. Southco has only one class 2 building, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Therefore, option D is not possible.
    Option E: RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings, but they need to trade the class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building. Southco has only one class 2 building, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Trustcorp has only class 2 buildings, so it is not possible to make a valid trade. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  To make one trade, each company must trade one of its buildings with another company's building.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, the companies must trade buildings of the same class or follow the rules for trading class 1 or class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is for RealProp to trade the Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings.
  The only company that has two class 2 buildings is Trustcorp.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for the King Building and the Ortiz Building.
  After this trade, the companies will own the following buildings:
    RealProp: the Yates House (class 3) and the Zimmer House (class 3)
    Southco: the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2)
    Trustcorp: the Garza Tower (class 1), the King Building (class 2), and the Ortiz Building (class 2)
  The answer is D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp has one class 1 building, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, they must trade one building for another building of the same class, or one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to receive two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 3 building is to receive two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House can only be traded for two class 2 buildings each.
  The Garza Tower can only be traded for one class 2 building or one class 3 building.
  The Flores Tower can only be traded for one class 2 building or one class 3 building.
  The Lynch Building can only be traded for one class 3 building.
  The King Building and the Ortiz Building can only be traded for one class 1 building or two class 3 buildings.
  From the answer choices, only option E has buildings that can be traded according to the rules.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Since there is only one trade, the number of buildings owned by the three companies must remain the same.
  Therefore, the sum of the number of buildings in each class owned by the three companies must remain the same.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  There are three types of trades that can be made, and we need to make only one trade.
  If we trade a class 1 building, we can get two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If we trade a class 2 building, we can get two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If we trade a class 3 building, we can only get a class 3 building in return.
  Therefore, we can only trade the Garza Tower or the Flores Tower.
  If we trade the Garza Tower, we can get two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If we trade the Flores Tower, we can get two class 3 buildings or one class 2 building.
  The buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made could be:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House (class 3)
  Southco: the Flores Tower (class 2)
  Trustcorp: the Garza Tower (class 1)
  Therefore, the answer is not A, not B, not C, not D, and is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Only one trade is made, so each company must trade one building.
  The only way to trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings is if one of the other companies has two class 2 buildings to trade.
  The only way to trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is if one of the other companies has two class 3 buildings to trade.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is RealProp trading the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.

  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp has a class 1 building, which can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  Southco has a class 1 building, which can only be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  Trustcorp has no class 1 building, so it cannot trade for one.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings, which can be traded for three class 1 buildings or six class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade two of its class 2 buildings for four class 3 buildings.
  Southco can trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade its class 1 building for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
  RealProp can trade its class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade its class 1 building for two of Trustcorp's class 2 buildings.
  RealProp has two class 3 buildings, which can be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade both of its class 3 buildings for two class 2 buildings.
  After all trades are made, RealProp will have two class 2 buildings and Trustcorp will have four class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  A trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only trade it for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is RealProp trading the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  After the trade, RealProp owns the Flores Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Lynch Building.
  The answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 3. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 and chapter 7, but this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 7. If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 1 and chapter 7, but this violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  W must be mentioned after T, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapters 2 and 4 in some order.
  R is the only remaining clue. It can be mentioned in chapter 1, 5, or 7.
  Therefore, R can be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is option B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 6, because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, and there are only seven chapters, then S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 4, or 5, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, and X cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Based on the above constraints, R could be mentioned in chapter 1 or 5.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later. Then, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 5, so S must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7. Therefore, C is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, so Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier. Then, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, so S must be mentioned in chapter 1 or 4. Therefore, C is not possible.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Then, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 5 and 7, so S must be mentioned in chapter 1 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, D is possible.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Then, S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 5 and 7, so S must be mentioned in chapter 1 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, E is possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later. Then, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5. Then, S and X cannot be mentioned in chapters 4 and 6, so S must be mentioned in chapter 7 and X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Therefore, B is possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier. Then, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later and W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Then, S and X cannot be mentioned in chapters 4 and 7, so S must be mentioned in chapter 1 and X must be mentioned in chapter 4. Therefore, B is possible.
  Therefore, B, D, and E are possible.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if U is mentioned in chapter 3, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapters 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W cannot be mentioned in chapters 3, 4, or 5.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  Since T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T can only be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3. If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5. If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5 or earlier.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is U in chapter 3, X in chapter 4, T in chapter 2 or 3, W in chapter 6, S in chapter 7, Z in chapter 5, and R in chapter 1 or 5.
  The only choice that could be true is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.

Response 6:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, and W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang can be in the list because they do not review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the list must be either Kramer and O'Neill or Kramer, O'Neill, and one more student.
  The list cannot be just Kramer because the question asks for a list of students who review Tamerlane, and we know that O'Neill also reviews Tamerlane.
  The list cannot be all five students because the question says that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the only possible list is Kramer, O'Neill, and one more student.
  The only option that includes Kramer and O'Neill and one more student is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill are two of the students who review Tamerlane.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who review exactly the same play or plays as Kramer or O'Neill.
- However, neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Therefore, Jiang cannot be the other student who reviews Tamerlane.
- Since Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Lopez or Megregian.
- However, Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Therefore, Megregian cannot be the other student who reviews Tamerlane.
- The only possibility is that the other student who reviews Tamerlane is Lopez.
- Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, O'Neill, and Lopez.
- The answer is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be one of the students who review the same play as one of the other students.
  We know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  We also know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review all three plays.
  If Megregian reviews all three plays, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the third student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Jiang, Kramer, or O'Neill.
  If Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then there would be no two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  If Kramer and O'Neill review Tamerlane, then they are the two students who review the same play as each other.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  Jiang cannot review any play that Lopez or Megregian reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Jiang is not in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  This means that either Kramer or O'Neill must be in the same list as another student.
  The only answer choice that includes Kramer or O'Neill with another student is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  The list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  The answer choices that include Kramer and O'Neill are B, C, and D.
  If the list includes Megregian, then it cannot include Lopez because Megregian reviews fewer plays than Lopez.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane is either B or C or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  The answer must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  From the given conditions, exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the answer must have only two students, and they both review Tamerlane.
  The answer must not include Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang since they do not review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  From the answer choices, only B and C include Kramer and O'Neill.
  If C is correct, then Lopez must also review Tamerlane, which means Megregian cannot review Tamerlane.
  However, the question states that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, C cannot be correct.
  The only possibility is B, which includes Kramer and O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, answer choices that do not include Kramer and O'Neill cannot be correct.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, answer choices that do not include at least two students cannot be correct.
  We can eliminate answer choices A and E because they do not include O'Neill.
  We can eliminate answer choice C because it includes Lopez, who reviews fewer plays than Megregian.
  Answer choice D includes Kramer and O'Neill, and it also includes Megregian, who reviews more plays than Kramer and Lopez. Therefore, answer choice D is the only possible answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane since they either review fewer plays than Megregian or review the same play as Jiang.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Therefore, either Kramer or O'Neill must be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
- If Kramer is included, then Jiang cannot be included since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Therefore, O'Neill must be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
- If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer and Megregian would be the two students who review the same play.
- Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer, Megregian, and O'Neill.

Therefore, the organizer cannot select more than two French novels.
If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.
Therefore, the organizer cannot select both French plays.
Action: Answer("D") 
The organizer must select two French novels.
Response 2:

Response 3:
Thought:
To determine the minimum number of works the organizer must select, we need to consider the most restrictive requirements:
- At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

The group of works consists of:
- Three French novels
- Three Russian novels
- Two French plays
- One Russian play

If the organizer selects the minimum number of novels (three), then they must select at least one French and one Russian novel. If they select four novels, they must select two French and two Russian novels. Since the organizer cannot select more than four French works, they must select at least one Russian novel if they select four novels. Therefore, the organizer must select at least two Russian novels.

If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. Therefore, the organizer can select at most one French play. If they select one French play, they must select at least one Russian novel and one French novel to satisfy the other requirements.

Putting it all together, the organizer must select:
- At least three novels (at least one French and one Russian)
- At least two Russian novels
- At most one French play
- At least one French novel

The minimum number of works the organizer must select is therefore 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 7.

Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 4:
Thought:
To satisfy the requirements:
- At least three but no more than four novels are selected.
- No more than four French works are selected.
- At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
- If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected.

We can select 3 novels and 2 plays or 4 novels and 1 play.
If we select 4 novels, then we can select at most 2 French novels and at least 2 Russian novels.
If we select 3 novels, then we can select at most 2 French novels and at least 1 Russian novel.
If we select 2 plays, then we can select at most 1 French play and at least 1 Russian play.

Answer: 
  From the choices, the only option that satisfies the requirements is D: two French novels.
  Therefore, the organizer must at least select two French novels. Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 works.
  At least 3 but no more than 4 novels must be selected.

  If the organizer selects both French plays, then there can be at most three French novels.
  If the organizer selects one French play, then there can be at most four French novels.
  If the organizer selects no French plays, then there can be at most four French novels.
  The organizer must select at least one French novel and one Russian novel.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or C.
  If the organizer selects one French novel and one French play, then there can be at most two French novels. This does not satisfy the condition that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  If the organizer selects one French novel and one Russian play, then there can be at most three French novels. This satisfies the condition that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, B is the answer.
  If the organizer selects one Russian novel and one French play, then there can be at most three French novels. This satisfies the condition that at least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected. Therefore, C is also a possible answer.
  However, the question asks for the minimum number of works that the organizer must select. Therefore, the answer is B: one French novel and one Russian play.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The organizer must select at least 5 works and at most 6 works from a group of 9 works.
  The organizer must select at least 3 but no more than 4 novels.

  No more than 4 French works are selected.
  At least as many French novels as Russian novels are selected.
  The group consists of 3 French novels, 3 Russian novels, 2 French plays, and 1 Russian play.

Response 7:
Thought:
To satisfy the requirements, we can start by selecting 4 French works (at most) which must include at least one French novel and one French play. Then, we can select 3 or 4 novels which must include at least as many French novels as Russian novels. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. 

Action: Answer("D") 

Explanation:
To satisfy the requirements, the organizer must select at least one French novel and one French play. If we select two French novels, we can only select one French play and one Russian novel. This satisfies the requirement of selecting at least as many French novels as Russian novels. Therefore, the organizer must select at least two French novels. The organizer can select at most four French works, which means the organizer can select one French play and two French novels or two French plays and one French novel. In either case, the organizer must select at least three novels. Therefore, the organizer must select two French novels and at least one Russian novel. If both French plays are selected, then the Russian play is not selected. Therefore, the organizer must select at least five works, which must include two French novels, one French play, and at least one Russian novel. The only option that satisfies this is D: two French novels.

  To satisfy the requirement of at least as many French novels as Russian novels, the organizer must select at least 2 French novels.
  If the organizer selects both French plays, then the organizer must select at least 2 French novels and 1 Russian novel.
  If the organizer selects only one French play, then the organizer must select at least 2 French novels and 2 Russian novels.
  Therefore, the organizer must at least select two French novels.
  The answer is D: two French novels.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The Flores Tower is class 1.
  The Garza Tower is class 1.
  The Lynch Building is class 2.
  The Meyer Building is class 2.
  The King Building is class 2.
  The Ortiz Building is class 2.
  The Yates House is class 3.
  The Zimmer House is class 3.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the Flores Tower can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  A: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1, so it cannot own the Flores Tower, which is also class 1. This cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower, which is class 1, and the Meyer Building, which is class 2. This can be true.
  C: Southco owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1, and the Lynch Building, which is class 2. This cannot be true.

  The Zimmer House is owned by RealProp and is class 3.
  Southco does not own any class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp does not own any class 1 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. - This cannot be true as RealProp only owns the Garza Tower and it is class 1.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building. - This can be true as Southco owns the Flores Tower which is class 1 and the Meyer Building which is class 2.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. - This cannot be true as Southco does not own the Garza Tower.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. - This cannot be true as Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building which is class 2.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. - This cannot be true as Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.

  Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower because it is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to analyze each statement and see if it is possible or not based on the given information.
  A: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building. The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is also a class 1 building. Therefore, it is impossible for the buildings owned by RealProp to be the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. A is not true.
  B: Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building. Neither of these buildings is a class 2 building, so it is impossible for the buildings owned by Southco to be the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building. B is not true.
  C: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building. The Lynch Building is owned by Southco and is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is impossible for the buildings owned by Southco to be the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. C is not true.
  D: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is a class 1 building. The Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp and is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is impossible for the buildings owned by Trustcorp to be the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. D is not true.
  E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is a class 1 building. The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp and is a class 2 building. Therefore, it is impossible for the buildings owned by Trustcorp to be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is A, as it cannot be true that the buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know the current buildings owned by each company.
  We need to determine which options are impossible.
  Option A is impossible because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  Option B is impossible because the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, not Southco.
  Option C is impossible because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Southco.
  Option D is impossible because the Flores Tower is owned by Southco, not Trustcorp.
  Option E is possible because both the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building are owned by RealProp and Trustcorp respectively.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  A trade of one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings is allowed.
  A trade of one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is allowed.
  A trade of one building for one other building of the same class is allowed.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, they can only receive two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building in return.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, they can only receive two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building in return.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, they can only receive two class 3 buildings or one class 2 building in return.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. (Not possible because RealProp only owns one class 1 building, which is the Garza Tower.)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because Southco can trade the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (Not possible because Southco does not own the Garza Tower.)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. (Not possible because Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower.)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because Trustcorp can trade the Ortiz Building for the Garza Tower.)
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp cannot own Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Southco cannot own Garza Tower because it is owned by RealProp.
  Southco cannot own Meyer Building because it is owned by Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp cannot own Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Trustcorp cannot own Garza Tower because it is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Flores Tower is owned by Southco and is class 1, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp or RealProp.
  The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and is class 1, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp or Southco.
  The Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp and is class 2, so it cannot be owned by Southco.
  The Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp and is class 2, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are owned by RealProp and are class 3, so they cannot be traded for a class 1 building.
  Therefore, A, B, and D cannot be true.
  C and E are possible, but we need to check if they can be true.
  If Southco owns the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, then Trustcorp must own the Flores Tower and the Yates House, and RealProp must own the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building. This satisfies the trading conditions.
  If Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building, then RealProp must own the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building, and Southco must own the Yates House and the Ortiz Building. This also satisfies the trading conditions.
  Therefore, C and E can both be true.

Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday and Iturbe must testify on Wednesday.
According to the conditions, exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday. Since Hong cannot testify on Tuesday, then Garcia and Jackson must testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and Hong is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
The only option that satisfies this schedule is D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Hong.
  Hong does not testify on Monday, so Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Monday, which is not possible because at least one witness must testify on Monday.
  Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday.
  Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Franco cannot testify on Wednesday.
  If Franco testifies on Tuesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday and Jackson must testify on Tuesday, which is not possible because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  The only remaining day for Jackson to testify is Tuesday.
  Therefore, Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  The answer is A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.

Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Waite, Trillo, Zinn, or Yoshida.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Waite, Trillo, Zinn, or Yoshida.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must be first or second and Trillo must be third or fourth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must be fifth or earlier and Yoshida must be sixth.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  Checking the remaining answer choices, we can see that only one of them satisfies all the given conditions.
  The answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:

- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Waite's, Kammer's, or Trillo's.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be first, second, or third.
- Based on the above conditions, the possible order of auditions is: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida or Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida, Zinn.
- The first option is not possible because it violates the condition that the fifth audition must be recorded.
- The second option is not possible because it violates the condition that the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
- The third option is possible because it satisfies all the conditions.
- The fourth option is not possible because it violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- The fifth option is not possible because it violates the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
- Therefore, the answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.

Response 2:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the auditions that are not recorded.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it cannot be the fourth audition.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second, and Trillo's audition must be third or fourth.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be fourth or earlier, and Yoshida's audition must be last.
- Based on the above conditions, the possible order of the auditions is: Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either first, second, or third.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices:
    - A: Kammer's audition cannot be fourth, so this order is not possible.
    - C: Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition, so this order is not possible.
    - E: The fourth audition cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's, so this order is not possible.
  We are left with answer choices B and D. Let's check if they satisfy all the conditions:
    - B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
      - The fourth audition is Zinn's, which is not recorded.
      - The fifth audition is Lugo's, which is recorded.
      - Waite's audition is first, which is earlier than the two recorded auditions.
      - Kammer's audition is second, which is earlier than Trillo's audition.
      - Zinn's audition is third, which is earlier than Yoshida's audition.
      - This order satisfies all the conditions.
    - D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
      - The fourth audition is Trillo's, which is not recorded.
      - The fifth audition is Lugo's, which is recorded.
      - Waite's audition is first, which is earlier than the two recorded auditions.
      - Kammer's audition is third, which is earlier than Trillo's audition.
      - Zinn's audition is second, which is earlier than Kammer's audition.
      - This order satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, both answer choices B and D are possible orders.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded. 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Trillo's or Zinn's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be third or earlier.
  Based on these conditions, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E.
  The remaining choices are B and D.
  In choice B, Waite's audition is first, which satisfies the condition that Waite's audition must be earlier than the two recorded auditions. Then Kammer's audition is second, which satisfies the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. The rest of the order also satisfies the conditions. Therefore, the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so Lugo's audition must be the fifth.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Zinn and Yoshida cannot be fourth.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must be first or second and Trillo must be third or fourth.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must be before Yoshida.
  Using the above conditions, we can eliminate choices A and E.
  Let's try to use the remaining conditions to eliminate more choices.
  In choice B, Waite is first, Kammer is second, and Yoshida is third. However, this violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, choice B is not valid.
  In choice C, Waite is first, Lugo is fifth, and Trillo is fourth. This satisfies all conditions, so choice C is valid.
  In choice D, Waite is first, Zinn is second, and Yoshida is sixth. However, this violates the condition that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, choice D is not valid.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the auditions that are not recorded.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.

  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or the sixth audition.
  Based on these conditions, we can eliminate some choices:
  - Choice A: Trillo's audition cannot be the second audition because Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Choice B: This choice satisfies all the conditions.
  - Choice C: Kammer's audition cannot be the third audition because Trillo's audition must take place after Kammer's audition.
  - Choice D: Zinn's audition cannot be the first audition because Yoshida's audition must take place after Zinn's audition.

  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. Therefore, Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  Robertson: #1
  Young: #3 or #4
  Togowa: #5

  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the possible parking space assignments for Robertson are #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E.
  Choice C assigns Togowa to parking space #1, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is choice D.

  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  #1: Robertson; #2: Togowa; #3: Xu; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Young
  The answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the parking spaces #5 and #6 cannot be assigned to Robertson.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above rules, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
  Let's check each option against these rules.
  Option A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
    - Robertson is assigned parking space #4, which is valid.
    - Young is assigned parking space #1, which is invalid.
    - Xu is assigned parking space #6, which is invalid.
    - Therefore, option A is not valid.

  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, the only possible assignment is:
  #1: Robertson; #2: Young; #3: Souza; #4: Togowa; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2 and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2 and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate options A and B.
  The only option that satisfies all the rules is option D.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and neither of these years are available for Tiffany to be assigned to.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan is assigned to one of the years 1921, 1922, or 1924, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1923.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to the project since they are both assigned to a specific year. 
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. But Ryan is already assigned to the project, so Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But Mollie cannot be assigned to the project since Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned to the project. 
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. But Onyx cannot be assigned to the project since Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned to the project. 
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is that Yoshio is assigned to 1922, and the remaining year assignments are Ryan to 1924 and Onyx to 1923. 
  The answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, and Ryan is assigned to a year, then Onyx must be assigned to the year before Ryan's.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is Mollie to 1921, Ryan to 1922, Onyx to 1923, and Tiffany to 1924.
  Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922 because Ryan is assigned to that year.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is Mollie to 1921, Yoshio to 1922, Ryan to 1923, and Tiffany to 1924.
  The answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, but Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. However, both Ryan and Yoshio are already assigned, so Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Ryan and Yoshio must be assigned to 1923 and 1924, but we do not know which student is assigned to which year.
  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922, which means Mollie must be assigned to 1921. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1924, and Yoshio cannot be assigned to any year, which is not possible. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1923, then Louis must be assigned to 1924. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1923, and Ryan and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 and 1922 in some order. Therefore, the following could be true: Yoshio is assigned to 1923 and Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  The answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. But Onyx is already assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Mollie is not assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. But Tiffany is already assigned to the project. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio is the only student left. Therefore, Yoshio must be assigned to 1921.
  The only statement that is true is that Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio could be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  The only remaining year is 1921, which means Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1924.
  Yoshio can be assigned to any year except 1923.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  We know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  We know that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  However, we do not know which day that is.
  Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia.
  Therefore, Lan must lead a session on Wednesday and Olivia on Friday.
  We can determine the schedule of four lab assistants: Julio, Nessa, Lan, and Olivia.
  Therefore, the answer is D: four. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday or Thursday sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, Nessa must lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday morning or Friday morning session.
  There are two lab assistants left, and they must lead the remaining sessions.
  Therefore, for each of the two remaining lab assistants, there is only one session left that they can lead.
  The answer is B: two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  From the given information, we know that:
    - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
    - Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on different days.
    - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means she can only lead the Thursday afternoon session.
    - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, which means his session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then we know that:
    - Nessa cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
    - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Friday.
    - Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Friday, respectively.
    - Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, and Olivia. We cannot determine the sessions led by Nessa and Julio (since we only know the day and time of one of their sessions).
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  From the constraints, we know that:
    - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
    - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
    - Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
    - Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  We can use these constraints to create a table to keep track of the possible assignments.
  We know that Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, so we can fill that in.
  We also know that Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so we can fill in Nessa for the Friday afternoon session.
  We can use the constraint that Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's to narrow down the possibilities for Olivia's session. Since Julio is leading the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia's session must be on Friday. This means that Lan's session must be on Wednesday, since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  We are left with Kevin and Rebecca to assign to the remaining three sessions. Since Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, they must be assigned to either Wednesday or Thursday. There are two possibilities for this assignment: Kevin and Rebecca can lead the Wednesday sessions, or they can lead the Thursday sessions.
  If Kevin and Rebecca lead the Wednesday sessions, then we know that Kevin leads the morning session and Rebecca leads the afternoon session. This leaves Julio to lead the Thursday morning session and Lan to lead the Friday morning session.
  If Kevin and Rebecca lead the Thursday sessions, then we know that Kevin leads the afternoon session and Rebecca leads the morning session. This leaves Lan to lead the Wednesday morning session and Julio to lead the Friday morning session.
  In either case, we can determine the assignments for Lan, Nessa, Julio, and Olivia. Therefore, the answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on different days.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Therefore, Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday.
  Thus, we know the following:
    Wednesday morning: Julio
    Wednesday afternoon: (either Kevin or Rebecca)
    Thursday morning: (either Lan or Olivia)
    Thursday afternoon: Nessa
    Friday morning: (the person who did not lead the Wednesday afternoon session)
    Friday afternoon: (the person who did not lead the Thursday morning session)
  We can determine the lab assistant for the Wednesday morning, Thursday afternoon, and Friday afternoon sessions.
  Therefore, for three of the other lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, neither Lan nor Olivia can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she cannot lead the Thursday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead either the Wednesday or Friday sessions.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session must be on Wednesday or Thursday and Olivia's session must be on Thursday or Friday.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  Lan cannot lead the Wednesday morning session, so she must lead the Friday morning session.
  Nessa must lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab session for all lab assistants except for Lan.
  The answer is B: two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  This means that Lan and Olivia cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead the Wednesday morning and Friday morning sessions in some order.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday afternoon or Friday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they must lead the Wednesday morning and Wednesday afternoon sessions or the Friday morning and Friday afternoon sessions.
  Therefore, we can determine which sessions Kevin and Rebecca lead, which session Nessa leads, and which sessions Lan and Olivia lead.
  This leaves us with two lab assistants, Julio and one other, to assign to the remaining two sessions.
  Therefore, we can determine the lab assistant for two sessions, and the answer is B: two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day. Therefore, one of them leads the Wednesday morning session and the other leads the Friday morning session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Therefore, she leads the Wednesday afternoon or Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session is on Wednesday afternoon and Olivia's session is on Friday morning.
  We can determine the session of all the lab assistants except for one.
  Therefore, the answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session:
  - Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  - Julio's session must be before Olivia's, so his session must be on Wednesday or Thursday morning.
  - Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so her session must be on Wednesday or Friday.
  - Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, but they cannot be on Thursday or Friday.
  - Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday.
  - Therefore, the assignments for Kevin and Rebecca are the only ones that cannot be determined.
  There are four lab assistants whose sessions can be determined: Julio, Lan, Nessa, and Olivia.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead the remaining session on the opposite day that Kevin and Rebecca lead their sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she will lead the remaining afternoon session on the opposite day that Julio leads his session.
  Therefore, we know the lab assistant for all six sessions: 
  Wednesday morning: Lan or Olivia
  Wednesday afternoon: Nessa
  Thursday morning: Kevin or Rebecca
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: Kevin or Rebecca
  Friday afternoon: Lan or Olivia
  We can determine the lab assistant for all of the sessions except for the Wednesday morning session. Therefore, the answer is A: one.

Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.

  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
    If this were true, then wall 1 would have only the works of Franz and Greene. This would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, A cannot be true.
    
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    If this were true, then wall 2 would have only the works of Franz and Hidalgo. This would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, B cannot be true.
    
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
    This is possible, as we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, C could be true.
    
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
    This is possible, as we know that each wall has exactly one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. Therefore, D could be true.
    
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    If this were true, then wall 3 would have only the works of Isaacs and Hidalgo. This would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, E cannot be true.
    
  Based on the above analysis, the answer is A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.

Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on one of the walls other than wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Based on the above conditions, we can determine that Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor or Isaacs's oil.
  A, B, and E are possible scenarios based on the given conditions.
  C is possible because Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.

  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then wall 1 must have both of their paintings. This means that Hidalgo and Isaacs' paintings must be on walls 2 and 3, but neither of them can be on wall 4. This violates the condition that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  
  B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 1 must have both of their paintings. This means that Greene and Isaacs' paintings must be on walls 2 and 3, but neither of them can be on wall 4. This does not violate any of the given conditions. Therefore, B can be true.
  
  C: We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of that same wall. This means that C cannot be true.
  
  D: If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position. This does not violate any of the given conditions. Therefore, D can be true.
  
  E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 1 must have both of their paintings. This means that Franz and Greene's paintings must be on walls 2 and 3, but neither of them can be on wall 4. This violates the condition that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, E cannot be true.

  B cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 2 would have only the work of Franz and Hidalgo.
  C can be true because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, but we don't know the position of Greene's oil.
  D can be true because we don't know the positions of Hidalgo's paintings.
  E cannot be true because we know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.

  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Helen or Irving gives a report on Tuesday, then they must give a report on Wednesday as well.
  If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday and Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Irving gives a report on Monday, then Helen must give a report on Tuesday and Nina must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Irving cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Olivia must give a report on Tuesday and George must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Lenore gives a report on Monday, then Robert must give a report on Tuesday and George must give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Lenore cannot give a report on Monday.
  The only remaining option is that Nina gives a report on Wednesday. If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Olivia must give a report on Tuesday and Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.

  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday, so she must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Tuesday.
  This means that if Helen gives a report, then Irving must give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  Therefore, if Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, then they must give reports on Wednesday.

- There are only two reports given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
- We need to find a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.
- We can start by looking at the students who can give a report on Wednesday, which are George, Olivia, and Robert.
- If Olivia or Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
- If George gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday, so they must give reports on Monday.
- Therefore, the only possible pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are George and Lenore, since George can only give a report on Tuesday and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
- The answer is A: George and Lenore.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:

  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  That means that George cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, George must give a report on Tuesday.
  We can also conclude that Olivia and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday, but we don't know which one will give a report in the morning or afternoon.
  That leaves Lenore and Kyle to give reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday.
  That means that Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then she must give a report on Wednesday.
  Now, we need to find a pair of students who, if they give reports on the same day as each other, must give reports on Wednesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  If Olivia and Robert give reports on Monday and Wednesday, then they cannot give reports on the same day as each other.

  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day.
  Therefore, Helen and Irving must give reports on the same day as Nina if Nina gives a report.
  The only day George can give a report is Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on the same day as Helen and Irving.
  Therefore, if Helen and Irving give reports on the same day, they must give reports on Wednesday.

  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  Let's consider each pair of students:
  - George cannot be paired with anyone because he must give his report on Tuesday.
  - If Lenore gives a report on Monday, then Kyle and Olivia must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Lenore cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  - If Helen gives a report on Monday, then Irving must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, so she must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Kyle and Olivia must give reports on Monday. Therefore, if Helen gives a report on Monday, she must be paired with Nina, who must give a report on Wednesday. So, B is a possible answer.
  - If Irving gives a report on Monday, then Helen must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, so she must give a report on Wednesday. This means that Kyle and Olivia must give reports on Monday. Therefore, if Irving gives a report on Monday, he must be paired with Nina, who must give a report on Wednesday. So, C is a possible answer.
  - If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then Olivia must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Kyle cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Kyle and Olivia must give reports on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, she must be paired with Kyle, who must give a report on Wednesday. So, D is a possible answer.
  - If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Kyle must give a report on Tuesday. This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, which means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia cannot be paired with anyone who must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possible answers are B and C.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 7:

  We know that George cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday, so he must give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must both give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on either Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, we need to find a pair of students who can only give reports on Wednesday, regardless of whether Nina gives a report or not.
  The only pair of students who can only give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:

  - George and Lenore: George can only give a report on Tuesday, so Lenore cannot be paired with George on Wednesday.
  - Helen and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, which cannot be Wednesday because Nina's report must be on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Helen and Nina must give reports on Wednesday.
  - Irving and Robert: We don't have any information about these two students.
  - Kyle and Nina: If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day, which cannot be Wednesday because Nina's report must be on Wednesday. Therefore, if Nina gives a report, then Kyle and Nina must give reports on Wednesday.
  - Olivia and Kyle: We don't have any information about these two students.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden cannot give the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then the only remaining lecture for Jiang is the sculptures lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then the only remaining lecture for Jiang is the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then the only remaining lecture for Garcia is the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Holden cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be the last lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the oil paintings lecture or the lithographs lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the first lecture.
  If Holden's lecture is the first lecture, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures must be the second and the fourth lectures, but we don't know which one is which.
  Farley's lecture must be the second lecture, and the oil paintings lecture must be the third lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  If Holden gives the first lecture, then Garcia's lecture must be the last lecture. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs, then Farley must give the sculptures lecture and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture.
  If the order of the lectures is sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We are given that the watercolors lecture is third.
  We know that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be either the watercolors lecture or the sculptures lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be either the watercolors lecture, the oil paintings lecture, or the sculptures lecture.
  If Farley's lecture is the watercolors lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be second. But this is impossible because the watercolors lecture is third and the lithographs lecture must be last.
  If Farley's lecture is the sculptures lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be second and the watercolors lecture must be first. But this is impossible because the watercolors lecture is third.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the sculptures lecture, and the oil paintings lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be either the watercolors lecture or the sculptures lecture. But the watercolors lecture is already taken, so Holden's lecture must be the sculptures lecture.
  Garcia's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture, and Jiang's lecture must be the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The watercolors lecture is third, which means the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which means Farley's lecture must be either on sculptures or watercolors.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which means Holden's lecture must be on either oil paintings or sculptures.
  If the order of the lectures is oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs, then Farley's lecture must be on sculptures, Holden's lecture must be on oil paintings, and Garcia's lecture must be on lithographs, and Jiang's lecture must be on watercolors.
  Therefore, Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden's lecture must be on sculptures, Farley's lecture must be on watercolors, and Jiang's lecture must be on lithographs.
  Therefore, B could be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be on oil paintings, Farley's lecture must be on watercolors, and Jiang's lecture must be on lithographs.
  Therefore, C could be true.
  If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture must be on oil paintings, Farley's lecture must be on watercolors, and Jiang's lecture must be on lithographs.
  Therefore, D could be true.
  If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley's lecture must be on sculptures, Holden's lecture must be on oil paintings, and Garcia's lecture must be on watercolors.
  Therefore, E could be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  So, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  We can use these constraints to determine which options could be true.
  If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Farley's lecture, which contradicts the constraints.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which is consistent with the constraints.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which is consistent with the constraints.
  If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture, which contradicts the constraints.
  If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the fact that the watercolors lecture is third.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first or second.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be first.
  If Holden's lecture is first, then Farley's lecture must be second and Garcia's lecture must be fourth.
  This leaves Jiang's lecture for the oil paintings lecture and Garcia's lecture for the sculptures lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the sculptures lecture in the first order or the watercolors lecture in the second order.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture in the first order, or the sculptures lecture in the second order.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then in the first order, the order of the lectures must be sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, lithographs.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the sculptures lecture, and Holden's lecture must be the oil paintings lecture.
  Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be the watercolors lecture and the lithographs lecture, but we don't know which order they are in.
  Therefore, it is possible that Garcia gives the lithographs lecture, and Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
  The only option that could be true is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures could be: oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be the watercolors lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Jiang must give the sculptures lecture and Holden must give the watercolors lecture. But this contradicts the fact that the watercolors lecture is third.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture and Holden must give the watercolors lecture. This satisfies all the constraints and is consistent with the fact that the watercolors lecture is third.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture is last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture is first or second.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture is first.
  Based on the above analysis, we can conclude that Holden gives the first lecture and Farley gives the second lecture.
  Therefore, Garcia and Jiang give the third and fourth lectures, but we don't know which one gives which lecture.
  Let's go through the answer choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. This is not possible because we know that the watercolors lecture is third and Farley's lecture is first or second.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. This is possible because we don't know which one gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This is not possible because we know that Garcia gives the third lecture and the third lecture is the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. This is not possible because we know that Holden gives the first lecture and the first lecture is not the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. This is possible because we know that Jiang gives the fourth lecture and the fourth lecture is the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or E.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q or R is selected, then M must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, at most one botanist can be selected if P is the only zoologist selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then the possible combinations are KL, KM, or LM.
  If KL is selected, then only one botanist can be selected, which can be either F, G, or H. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  If KM is selected, then only one botanist can be selected, which can be either F or H. G cannot be selected because K and G cannot both be selected. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  If LM is selected, then only one botanist can be selected, which can be either G or H. F cannot be selected because L and F cannot both be selected. This is not related to P being the only zoologist selected.
  Therefore, none of the choices must be true if P is the only zoologist selected.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If Q is selected, then at least one botanist and one chemist must be selected.
  If R is selected, then at least one botanist and one chemist must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F, G, H, L, and M cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then K, F, G, H, and L cannot be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If G is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If H is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If L is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If Q is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If R is selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then L must be selected to satisfy the condition that at least one botanist is selected.
  If L is selected, then F cannot be selected to satisfy the condition that at most one botanist is selected.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then we know that there is at least one botanist and one chemist selected. 
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, which means that either F or G is selected but not both.
  If K is selected, then F and M cannot be selected. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  We need to determine which of the statements must be true based on the given conditions.
  If K is selected, then G can be selected because there is no condition that forbids it. Therefore, statement A is not necessarily true.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected because there is no condition that forbids it. Therefore, statement B is not necessarily true.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be any of the three chemists. Therefore, statement C is not necessarily true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then it could be KL, KM, or LM. If KL is selected, then F or G must be selected. If KM is selected, then P and R must also be selected. If LM is selected, then F or G must be selected. Therefore, statement D is not necessarily true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then it could be KL, KM, or LM. If KL is selected, then F or G must be selected. If KM is selected, then P and R must also be selected. If LM is selected, then F or G must be selected. Therefore, statement E is not necessarily true.
  None of the statements must be true based on the given conditions.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then R cannot be selected because if M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, Q must be selected to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Since P is the only zoologist selected, at most one botanist can be selected.
  If F is selected, then G and H cannot both be selected because there can be at most one botanist and if F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, then M must be selected to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if L is selected, then F cannot be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be either K, L, or M to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and M to fulfill the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F cannot be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is B: If L is selected, then F cannot be selected. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, which means if F is selected, then P and Q or P and R cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F and M cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then P and R must be selected.
  Let's evaluate each choice:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between K and G. This choice cannot be true.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - There is no direct relationship between L and F. This choice cannot be true.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This statement is not true. If only one chemist is selected, it could be any of the three chemists.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This statement is true. If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, which means two chemists cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This statement is not true. There is no direct relationship between the number of selected chemists and G.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 5:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must have at least one botanist and one chemist.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then neither R nor M can be selected.
  If M is not selected, then the panel can have at most one botanist and one zoologist.
  If K is not selected, then the panel can have at most one chemist and one zoologist.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then G can be selected.
  Therefore, the statement "If L is selected, F cannot be selected" is not necessarily true, and the answer is not B or D.
  The statement "If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K" is not necessarily true, since the panel can have at most one chemist if K is not selected.
  The statement "If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected" is not necessarily true, since G can be selected if L and M are selected.
  The only statement that must be true is "If K is selected, G cannot be selected."
  Therefore, the answer is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be represented by at least one panelist each. 
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, if P is the only zoologist, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. If P is the only zoologist, then M cannot be selected.
  If F and K cannot both be selected, then if K is selected, F cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then there are no restrictions on which botanists or zoologists can be selected.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected because P is the only zoologist selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, if K is not selected, then F can be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected.
  Therefore, B, C, D, and E cannot be true.
  The only possible answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one chemist selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If F and K cannot both be selected, then either F or K must be selected.
  If K and M cannot both be selected, then either K or M must be selected.
  Let's try to eliminate the choices that are false.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true since G can be selected instead of F. So, A is false.
  If L is selected, then F cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true since G can be selected instead of F. So, B is false.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. This is not necessarily true since L can be selected instead of K. So, C is false.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. This is true because if F is selected, then either K or M must be selected which is not possible since only two chemists can be selected. So, D is true.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. This is not necessarily true since L can be selected instead of K. So, E is false.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 9:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then either Q or R must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then at most one botanist can be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If K is selected, then M cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  
  A. If K is selected, then M cannot be selected. There is no information about G. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B. If L is selected, then M must be selected, and P and R must be selected. In this case, F cannot be selected because if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, this statement must be true.
  C. If exactly one chemist is selected, it could be K, L, or M. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  D. If exactly two chemists are selected, then F and G must be selected. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E. If exactly two chemists are selected, then F and G must be selected. There is no information about K. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  
  The only statement that must be true is B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then he/she cannot work with Parra.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then he/she cannot work with Tiao or Udall.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then he/she cannot work with Stuckey or Udall.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as either Stuckey or Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find the sales representative that cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Parra works in Zone 1 or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We have seven sales representatives and three sales zones.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra also works in Zone 1, but this is not possible since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Tiao also works in Zone 2, but this is not possible since either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in a sales zone, Parra must also work in the same sales zone.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 2 and Zone 3, respectively, which contradicts the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  To determine which sales representative Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone with, we need to consider the sales representatives who are not mentioned in any of the above conditions.
  Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in any of the above conditions.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Kim, then Mahr would have to work in the same sales zone as Parra, which is not possible because there is only one sales representative left for Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Mahr, then Stuckey and Udall would have to work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, which is not possible because either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, then Udall would have to work in Zone 1, which is not possible because either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then Udall would have to work in Zone 3, which is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in a sales zone, then Parra must also work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, if we can find a sales representative who must work in the same sales zone as Quinn, we can answer the question.
  From the given conditions, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Stuckey must also work in Zone 3, which means Quinn and Parra must work in Zone 3 as well.
  So, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Therefore, if we can determine the sales zone where Parra works, we can determine the sales zone where Quinn works.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1 with Parra. 
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in the same sales zone as Quinn. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, which means they cannot work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. 
  This means that Udall works in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 3. 
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there are four sales representatives in Zone 3 and three in Zone 2. 
  This means that Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey. 
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in a sales zone, then Parra must also work in that same sales zone.
  If Quinn works in a sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall cannot work in that same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must also work in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2. This would leave only three sales representatives for Zone 3, which is less than Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then Parra must also work in Zone 2, and Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 1. This would leave only three sales representatives for Zone 3, which is less than Zone 2. Therefore, Quinn cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Parra must also work in Zone 3, and Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 1. This would leave only two sales representatives for Zone 2, which is less than Zone 3. Therefore, Quinn can work in Zone 3 with any of the sales representatives.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, or Tiao.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in the same sales zone as Tiao, then both Parra and Udall will be in Zone 3, which will violate the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  We need to find out which of the remaining sales representatives cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 1, and Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3, and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, and Mahr must work in Zone 3, and Kim must work in Zone 3. This is not possible because there are only two sales representatives in Zone 3.

Response 0:
Thought:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday morning or Thursday morning.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively.
  From the above constraints, we can conclude that the Thursday afternoon session can only be led by Julio or Nessa.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Julio, Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session can only be on Wednesday or Thursday, and Nessa's session can only be on Thursday or Friday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they cannot lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she can only lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Julio's session cannot be on Friday.
  Therefore, Julio's session must be on Wednesday, and Olivia's session must be on Thursday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin's session must be on Thursday, and Rebecca's session must be on Friday.
  Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  The answer is C: Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Olivia's session must be on Friday morning.
  Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan's session must be on Wednesday morning.
  The remaining session is Thursday morning, which could be led by either Julio or Nessa.
  Therefore, the lab assistants who could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Kevin, Rebecca, Julio, and Nessa.
  The answer is D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:

  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions must be on Wednesday and Nessa's session must be on Thursday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so neither of them can lead the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the Thursday afternoon session can be led by Julio, Kevin, or Rebecca.
  The answer is D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's, then Kevin's session must be on Thursday afternoon and Nessa's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Since Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Thursday.
  Therefore, Julio and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday and Friday.
  The lab assistants who are available to lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio, Kevin, Nessa, and Rebecca.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Julio, Kevin, Nessa, Rebecca.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Kevin's session is on the day before Nessa's session.
  Nessa's session must be in the afternoon.
  Therefore, Nessa's session is on Friday afternoon.
  Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions must be on the same day.
  Therefore, Kevin's and Rebecca's sessions are either on Wednesday or Thursday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Therefore, Lan's and Olivia's sessions are on Wednesday and Thursday or on Thursday and Friday.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Julio's session is on Wednesday or Thursday.
  If Julio's session is on Wednesday, then Olivia's session is on Friday, which contradicts the given constraints.
  Therefore, Julio's session is on Thursday.
  If Lan's session is on Wednesday, then Olivia's session is on Friday, which contradicts the given constraints.
  Therefore, Lan's session is on Thursday.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four or slot five.
  If Uneasy performs in slot four, then the order of the bands must be Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy, and Xpert.
  If Uneasy performs in slot five, then the order of the bands must be Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, and Uneasy.
  In both cases, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
  Therefore, the answer is B: three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign must perform in either slot two or slot three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, if Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot one, which is not possible because Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot two.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot two and Yardsign must perform in slot one.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  Therefore, Wellspring can perform in slot 2 or 3.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Zircon must perform in slot 1 or 2.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 5 or 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot one, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two, which again contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  The earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, Wellspring cannot perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Wellspring must perform in slot 4 or earlier.
  If Wellspring performs in slot 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.
  The answer is B: three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in one of the slots 4, 5, or 6.
  Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring performs in one of the slots 1, 2, or 3.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert performs in one of the slots 4, 5, or 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in one of the slots 4, 5, or 6.
  From the above constraints, we can conclude that:
    Yardsign performs in slot 1 or 2.
    Zircon performs in slot 4 or 5.
    Wellspring performs in slot 1, 2, or 3.
    Xpert performs in slot 6.
    Uneasy performs in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  If Zircon performs in slot 4, then Wellspring performs in slot 1 or 2.
  If Zircon performs in slot 5, then Wellspring performs in slot 1 or 2.
  If Zircon performs in slot 6, then Wellspring performs in slot 2 or 3.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 1.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy can only perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 4, then the order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy, and Xpert. This means Wellspring would perform in slot 3.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 5, then the order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, and Uneasy. This means Wellspring would perform in slot 2.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 6, then the order would be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, and Uneasy. This means Wellspring would perform in slot 2.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Zircon performs earlier than Yardsign.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert will perform in either slot five or six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy will perform in either slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign will perform in either slot one, two, or three.
  If Zircon performs earlier than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign will perform in either slot two or three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Wellspring can perform in slot three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot three, then Wellspring can perform in slot four.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is B: three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3, and Zircon must perform in slot 2.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 4.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited before Rovero.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters was recruited before Quinn and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was recruited after Peters, Quinn, Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited either before Tao or after the accomplice who was recruited after Tao.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited fifth and Rovero was recruited sixth.
  Therefore, Stanton could not have been recruited immediately before or after Tao, Rovero, or Quinn.
  The only possible position for Stanton is third.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining four accomplices.
  Since Peters was recruited fourth, the order of recruitment would be Quinn, Peters, Rovero, and the remaining four accomplices.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton could have been recruited either before Quinn or after Rovero.
  However, if Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Stanton could not have been recruited before Quinn.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton could not have been recruited before Quinn.
  The answer is B: second.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, the order of the accomplices must be Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining five people.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters must be one of the remaining five people.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be one of the remaining four people.
  Therefore, the remaining four people are Peters, Stanton, Tao, and White.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before Tao, then the order of the four people must be Villas, White, Stanton, and Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited fifth or seventh.
  The only two choices left are B: second and C: third.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of the four people must be Villas, White, Stanton, and Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of the four people must be Villas, White, Tao, and Stanton.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited fifth and Rovero was recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either first, second, third, or seventh.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao was recruited third and the order would be Stanton-Tao-Peters-Villas-White-Quinn-Rovero, which violates the condition that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then Tao was recruited fourth and the order would be Tao-Stanton-Peters-Villas-White-Quinn-Rovero, which satisfies all of the conditions.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited first.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited fifth and Rovero was recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the order of the recruits is Peters, Tao, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Stanton.
  Stanton was recruited last.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited first, second, third, or fifth.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the other four.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment for Stanton is either first, second, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be Stanton, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and Tao. But this violates the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and Tao. This is a valid order of recruitment that satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited second.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the accomplices is:
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited earlier than the fourth position.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn must have been recruited in one of the first three positions.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited in one of the first three positions or one of the last three positions.
  If Quinn was recruited in one of the first three positions, and Stanton was recruited in one of the first three positions or one of the last three positions, then it is possible that Stanton was recruited even if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero.
  Therefore, the answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn was recruited in the third position and Rovero was recruited in the fourth position.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, Peters was recruited after Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton could have been recruited in the first, second, fifth, sixth, or seventh position.
  However, if Stanton was recruited in the first or second position, then he would have been recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited in the fifth, sixth, or seventh position.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment is: 
  (1) Peters, (2) Tao, (3) Villas, (4) White, (5) Quinn, (6) Rovero, and (7) Stanton.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot be recruited 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th.
  The only option left is that Stanton was recruited first or seventh.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited seventh.

  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform a solo at some time after the trumpeter does, which means the saxophonist would perform the sixth solo, but the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the percussionist performs the second solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after the percussionist does and at some time after the trumpeter does, which means the saxophonist would perform either the fifth or the sixth solo.
  If the saxophonist performs the sixth solo, then the keyboard player must perform the fourth solo, but the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the saxophonist performs the fifth solo.
  The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, we can eliminate the options that violate these conditions.
  Greene's oil cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that only Greene's work is displayed on that wall.
  Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that only Isaacs's work is displayed on that wall.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because it would mean that wall 2 has only watercolors displayed on it.
  That leaves us with Franz's oil as a possible option, which could be displayed on wall 2 along with Hidalgo's oil.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Franz's oil.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, Greene's watercolor must also be displayed on wall 2.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  This would mean that wall 2 has only watercolors displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Franz's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  The only option left is that Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be an oil painting displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
  No wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, so there must be a painting by another student displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
  According to the given conditions, no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil is Franz's oil.
  The answer is A: Franz's oil.
Action: Answer("A")

Thought:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Since Hidalgo's oil is already displayed in the lower position of wall 2, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed in the lower position of wall 2.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor could be displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, neither Franz's oil nor Isaacs's watercolor can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then another student's painting must be displayed with Hidalgo's oil on wall 2.
  We know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  We also know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed with Hidalgo's oil on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We know that Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Wall 2 has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's paintings on wall 2 must include an oil painting.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so Hidalgo's paintings on wall 2 must include a painting by another student.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so neither of their paintings can be displayed on wall 2.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so his watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor could be displayed on wall 2, so the answer is D: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, wall 2 must have a painting by another artist.
  No wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, wall 2 must have a painting by another student.
  Wall 2 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Therefore, wall 2 cannot have Franz's oil or Isaacs's watercolor displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.

Response 1:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be bay 4, and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5. Therefore, Bay 4 cannot be holding textiles. 
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be bay 5, and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. Therefore, all options could be true except for option C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 and the bay holding livestock must be bay 4.
  If the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, then the bay holding produce must be bay 5 and the bay holding fuel must be bay 1 or bay 2.
  If the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding grain must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
  Therefore, bay 4 cannot be holding produce because it is holding textiles which is next to the bay holding produce.
  The answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 3, then the bay holding produce is bay 4.
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 4, then the bay holding produce is bay 5.
  Bay 2 cannot be holding fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay 4 cannot be holding produce because the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 can be holding textiles because it is not adjacent to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 5 can be holding grain or machinery because it is not adjacent to the bay holding produce or livestock.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either 3 or 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is 3, then the bay holding produce must be either 4 or 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is 4, then the bay holding produce must be either 3 or 5.
  If the bay holding produce is 4, then bay 3 must be holding textiles, and bay 5 must be holding livestock.
  If the bay holding produce is 5, then bay 3 must be holding livestock, and bay 4 must be holding textiles.
  Therefore, bay 2 cannot be holding fuel because fuel must be in bay 1 if produce is in bay 4.
  The answer is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3.
  Therefore, bay 5 cannot be holding grain or machinery because they would have to be in bays 1 and 2, which are lower than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay 2 can be holding fuel because it is not excluded by any of the given conditions.
  Bay 4 can be holding textiles because it is not excluded by any of the given conditions.
  Bay 5 cannot be holding grain because it would have to be in bay 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either 3 or 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the bay holding produce must be either 2 or 4.
  If the bay holding produce is 2, then the bay holding fuel must be 1, and the bay holding grain must be 6. This violates the condition that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  If the bay holding produce is 4, then the bay holding fuel must be 3, and the bay holding grain must be 5. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the only statement that is not true is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding textiles, and the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So, the bay holding produce must be either bay 4 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3 and the bay holding produce must be bay 4.
  We can use this information to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If bay 2 is holding fuel, then the bay holding produce cannot be bay 4.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding produce cannot be bay 4.
  If bay 5 is holding grain, then the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 3.
  If bay 5 is holding machinery, then the bay holding livestock cannot be bay 3.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce.

  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is in bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 4.
  If the bay holding livestock is in bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be in bay 5.
  If bay 2 is holding fuel, then the bay holding produce must be bay 6, which is not next to the bay holding livestock. Therefore, A is not true.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, which means the bay holding textiles must be bay 5. Therefore, C is possible.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding produce must be bay 6, which is not possible. Therefore, B is not true.
  If bay 5 is holding grain, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 4, which means the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. Therefore, D is possible.
  If bay 5 is holding machinery, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 4, which means the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. Therefore, E is possible.
  The only answer that cannot be true is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding produce must be bay 5.
  If bay 5 is holding grain, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 4.
  If bay 5 is holding machinery, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 4 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3.
  Therefore, each of the options A, B, C, and D could be true, but option E cannot be true because if bay 5 is holding machinery, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 4, which means the bay holding textiles must be bay 3, and therefore the bay holding produce must be bay 2, which contradicts the fact that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.

The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The western begins before the horror film, so it must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the sci-fi film and the western are shown on the same screen, then they must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown at 7 P.M. on the other screen and the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on the remaining screen.
  So, the possible schedule is: 
  Screen 1: 7 P.M. Western, 9 P.M. Sci-fi
  Screen 2: 7 P.M. Mystery, 9 P.M. Horror
  Screen 3: 8 P.M. Romance
  Therefore, the mystery could begin at 9 P.M., so the answer is B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown before the horror film.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the only screen that can show both the western and the sci-fi film is screen 1.
  Since the romance is not shown on screen 2, it must be shown on screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1.
  The only remaining option is that the mystery begins at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the mystery.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The western must be shown before the horror film, so it cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2, and the mystery must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 3. This means that the romance cannot be shown, which contradicts the given conditions.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2.
  This means that the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1, and the mystery must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  Therefore, the following could be true of this evening's schedule:
  The romance is shown on screen 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so neither can be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then the western must be shown on screen 2, and the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 as well. This would mean that the romance is shown on screen 3, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 2, and the western must be shown on screen 1. This means that the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2 as well. The romance is shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the mystery could begin at 9 P.M. (choice B) and the western could begin at 8 P.M. (choice E).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the western and sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens are screen 1 and screen 2.
  The horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 or screen 2 at 7 P.M. because the mystery is shown on a different screen.
  Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it is shown on screen 1.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then the western must be shown on screen 2, but this is not possible because the horror film is shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2 and the western is shown on screen 1.
  The mystery must be shown on screen 3 at 8 P.M., and the romance must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
  Therefore, the mystery begins at 8 P.M. (choice B) and the romance is not shown on screen 3 (not choice C).
  The only possible starting time for the sci-fi film is 9 P.M. (not choice D).
  The western cannot begin at 8 P.M. because the mystery is shown at that time (not choice E).
  Therefore, the answer is A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screen is screen 1 because the other screens have conflicts with the conditions.
  If the western begins before the horror film, then the western cannot begin at 8 P.M. on screen 1 because the horror film is shown after the western.
  The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 1 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The only possible option is that the horror film is shown at 8 P.M. on screen 3.
  Therefore, the mystery begins at 7 P.M. on screen 2.
  The answer is B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must start before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or screen 2, then there must be one screen that shows both the horror film and the mystery.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 2, which means the romance must be shown on screen 3.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 1, which means the romance must be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.

  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1.
  If the western begins at some time before the horror film does, then the western cannot be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2, then the sci-fi film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  If the western begins at 8 P.M., then it cannot be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on the other screen at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 3 at 8 P.M.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2, then the sci-fi film cannot begin at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the mystery must begin at 9 P.M. on screen 2.
  The only choice that could be true is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the top shelf and the bottom shelf are left for the other books.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so they are either both on the top shelf or both on the bottom shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we know that H is on the bottom shelf and L is on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the top shelf either.
  Therefore, K and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  If F is on the bottom shelf, then M is also on the bottom shelf.
  This means that G and H must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the same shelf as H or L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they cannot be on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf and H must be on the top shelf.
  G cannot be on the same shelf as F, M, or H, so it must be on the same shelf as K or O.
  Therefore, the only choice that must be true is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then there are two possibilities: L is placed on the top shelf and H is placed on the bottom shelf, or L is placed on the middle shelf and H is placed on the bottom shelf.
  If L is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, which is not possible. Therefore, L must be placed on the middle shelf and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf, and F must be placed on the middle shelf. Also, since F is placed on the same shelf as M, M must be placed on the middle shelf as well.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, O must be placed on the top shelf.
  Now, we have K and O on the top shelf, I on the middle shelf, and F, L, and M on the bottom shelf.
  From the remaining books, G and H must be placed on the same shelf, and they can only be placed on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M.
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be placed on the same shelf as L.
  Therefore, the only option left is that H and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be placed on the bottom shelf, and H cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  This means that L and H must be placed on the middle shelf together.
  If L and H are placed on the middle shelf together, then M and F must be placed on the bottom shelf together, since F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, G and K must be placed on the top shelf together, since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, and more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  This means that O must be placed on the middle shelf, since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and there are already two books on the top shelf.
  Therefore, K and O cannot be placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The only answer choice that must be true is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be on the top shelf.
  If L is on a shelf higher than H, then H must be on the bottom shelf and L must be on the middle or top shelf.
  If L is on the top shelf, then O must also be on the top shelf, which cannot be true because O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf and H must be on the bottom shelf.
  If H is on the bottom shelf, then G must also be on the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If G is on the bottom shelf, then F cannot be on the same shelf as G because K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B.
  If H is on the bottom shelf, then M cannot be on the bottom shelf because F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, H and M must be placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The only choice that matches this condition is C.
  Therefore, the answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then:
  - H cannot be placed on the top shelf because that would mean L is placed on the same or lower shelf than H.
  - H cannot be placed on the middle shelf because I is already placed on that shelf.
  - Therefore, H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  - Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then L must be placed on the bottom shelf as well.
  - If F is placed on the same shelf as M and L is placed on the bottom shelf, then F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf.
  - Therefore, K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  - The only answer choice that matches this conclusion is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then there are two possible cases:
  Case 1: L is placed on the top shelf, and H is placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Case 2: L is placed on the middle shelf, and H is placed on the bottom shelf.
  In either case, F and M must be placed on the same shelf, and I must be placed on the middle shelf.
  A, B, and D do not have any information related to L and H.
  C is not necessarily true because there is no restriction on the placement of H and M.
  E is also not necessarily true because there is no restriction on the placement of K and O.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be on the top shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf and H cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, L and H must be on the middle shelf together.
  If L and H are on the middle shelf together, then G cannot be on the middle shelf because there are already three books on that shelf (I, L, and H).
  Therefore, G must be on the top or bottom shelf.
  If G is on the top or bottom shelf, then F and K must be on the other shelf because K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, O must be on the same shelf as K.
  The only answer choice that must be true is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the middle shelf.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf, and H cannot be on the top shelf.
  If H is not on the top shelf, then F and K cannot be on the top shelf either.
  We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so they cannot both be on the top shelf either.
  Therefore, F, K, and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf, and O must be on the top shelf.
  G cannot be on the top shelf because there are already three books on that shelf (O, L, and I).
  If G is on the middle shelf, then H must be on the bottom shelf, which means L must be on the top shelf, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, G must be on the bottom shelf, and F and K must be on the middle shelf.
  If F and K are on the middle shelf, then H and M must be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 32 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either
Choices:
  A: F or else K
  B: F or else M
  C: K or else M
  D: M or else Q
  E: P or else Q
Response 0:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there must be at least one botanist and one zoologist.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then F cannot be selected because there can be at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then K and M cannot both be selected because F cannot be selected and there must be at least one botanist.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, the panel must include either K or M.
  The answer is C: K or else M.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then F cannot be selected because at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected.
  If F is not selected, then K or M must be selected to fulfill the condition of at least one scientist of each type.
  If K is selected, then M cannot be selected because K and M cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include M.
  The answer is D: M or else Q.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then there are two possibilities:
  1. One botanist is selected, and at most one zoologist is selected.
  2. Two botanists are selected, and no zoologist is selected.
  From the first possibility, we can conclude that either F or K must be selected. 
  From the second possibility, we can conclude that M cannot be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K. 
  The answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then the panel must include one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected.
  If K is selected, then at most one zoologist can be selected, so either P or R must be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or else M.
  The answer is B: F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then there must be at least one botanist on the panel.
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If K is selected, then P and R cannot both be selected. Therefore, M must be selected to satisfy the condition that both P and R must be selected if M is selected.
  If M is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, K must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at most one zoologist if more than one botanist is selected.
  If M is not selected, then either F or K must be selected to satisfy the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else M.
  The answer is B: F or else M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then there must be at least one botanist on the panel.
  If at most one zoologist is selected when more than one botanist is selected, then there must be at most one botanist on the panel.
  Therefore, either F or K must be selected.
  If F is selected, then there must be at most one zoologist on the panel. Therefore, M cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then both P and R must be selected if M is selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
  The answer is A: F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:

  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include either F or K or both.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Hence, the panel must include either K or M or both.
  If K is selected, then the panel must include either F or M or both.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or K or both, and either M or P and R.
  The answer is A: F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected and F is not selected, then the panel must include K.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected and F is not selected, then the panel cannot include both P and R.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected and F is not selected, then the panel cannot include M.
  If both G and H are among the scientists selected and F is selected, then the panel can include any other scientist(s) except K and M.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.
  The answer is A: F or else K.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If F is not selected, then either K or M must be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  We need to find an option that includes the sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - At most one of Parra and Tiao works in Zone 1, and at least one of them works in Zone 3.
  - At most one of Tiao and Udall works in Zone 2, and at least one of them works in Zone 3.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, which could be Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, which could be Zone 1, Zone 2, or Zone 3.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that:
  - If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3, and Quinn works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, so option A is not possible.
  - If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3, and Quinn works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, so option B is not possible.
  - If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 3, and Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3. Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, so option C is not possible.
  - If Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 1, then Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2, and Tiao works in Zone 3. This means that Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3, so option D is possible.
  - If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 2. This means that Stuckey works in Zone 3, and Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3, so option E is not possible.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall works in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 1 with Parra.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  The complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must be Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall.
  Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1 and Zone 2, respectively.
  Quinn is in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not include any of the sales representatives who are known to work in Zone 3.
  Option D includes three sales representatives in Zone 3, which is possible given the information we have.
  Option E includes all seven sales representatives, which is not possible given the information we have.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Since there are seven sales representatives in total, and we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. 
  From the given conditions, we know that neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 3, and neither Tiao nor Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must be Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, Quinn, or some combination of these four. 
  However, we also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Therefore, if any one of these four sales representatives works in Zone 3, then the other one from their pair must also work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall. 
  Answer: E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall. 

Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, there must be at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 and Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  This means that Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, so Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, so both work in Zone 3.
  This means that Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work in Zone 1, leaving only Stuckey and Udall to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since Udall works in Zone 3, Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so Quinn must work in Zone 1.
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 3 because if Tiao worked in Zone 3, then there would be more sales representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which is not possible.
  Also, Parra cannot work in Zone 3 because if Parra worked in Zone 3, then Tiao would have to work in Zone 1, which is not possible because Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because if they did, then there would be fewer sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, the sales representatives working in Zone 3 must be Kim, Mahr, and either Parra or Tiao.
  Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not include at least three sales representatives.
  Choice B is incorrect because Tiao works in Zone 2, not Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a table to organize the days of the week and the types of cookies.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possible combination is oatmeal cookies on Monday and sugar cookies on Wednesday.
  If oatmeal cookies are on Monday, then peanut butter cookies must be on Tuesday and Wednesday.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  The only statement that could be false is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  We know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of one kind of cookie must be made on Wednesday, and the third batch of another kind of cookie must be made on Wednesday.
  We can use this information to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. Therefore, A is true.
  If the third batch of another kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. Therefore, D is true.
  Since A and D are true, we can eliminate those answer choices.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, C is false.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. Therefore, B is true.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. Therefore, E is true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  Let's use the given information to determine which batches are made on which days.
  Since there are three batches of each kind of cookie, we know that there are a total of nine batches of cookies made each week.
  Let's start with the given information that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Monday, since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday or later.
  We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, which means that the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday.
  This also means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Now, let's consider the statement that one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  The only possible combination for this statement is if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday (since the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday).
  This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday or Friday.
  Now, let's consider each statement to see which could be false:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. - This statement must be true since we know that one batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, one batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday or Friday, and one batch of sugar cookies and one batch of oatmeal cookies are made on Thursday and Friday.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. - This statement must be true since we know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday or Friday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. - This statement is false since we know that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. - This statement must be true since we know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday and the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. - This statement must be true since we know that the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the statement that could be false is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use this information to determine which batches are made on the same day.
  We can then check each statement to see if it could be false based on the schedule we created.
  If a statement could be false, then the answer is that statement.
  If no statement could be false, then the answer is "None of the above".
  
Schedule:
Monday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1, sugar 1
Tuesday: oatmeal 2, sugar 2, peanut butter 2
Wednesday: sugar 3, oatmeal 3, peanut butter 3
Thursday: peanut butter 4, oatmeal 4, sugar 2
Friday: sugar 4, oatmeal 2, peanut butter 5

The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, so the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday. 
Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday.
The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.

If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies, then the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies is also made on Wednesday.
This means that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, so statement B is not false.

At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so statement A is not false.

Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so statement C is false.

Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so statement D is not false.

Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so statement E is not false.

Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The first batch of each kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  The second batch of each kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday.
  The third batch of each kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
  oatmeal 1st and sugar 3rd (Wednesday)
  peanut butter 1st and oatmeal 3rd (Wednesday)
  sugar 1st and peanut butter 3rd (Thursday)
  If oatmeal 1st and sugar 3rd are made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (either peanut butter or oatmeal), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (oatmeal 1st and sugar 3rd), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (peanut butter 1st and oatmeal 2nd), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar 2nd).
  If peanut butter 1st and oatmeal 3rd are made on Wednesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (either peanut butter or oatmeal), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (peanut butter 1st and oatmeal 3rd), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (oatmeal 1st and sugar 2nd), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar 3rd).
  If sugar 1st and peanut butter 3rd are made on Thursday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (either peanut butter or oatmeal), at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday (oatmeal 2nd and sugar 1st), exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (peanut butter 1st and oatmeal 3rd), and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday (sugar 3rd).
  Therefore, the only statement that could be false is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  To solve this problem, we need to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made. 
  From the conditions given, we know that:
  - There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  - Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  We can use these conditions to create the following schedule:
  
  Monday: oatmeal 1, peanut butter 1, sugar 1
  Tuesday: oatmeal 2, peanut butter 2, sugar 2
  Wednesday: oatmeal 3, peanut butter 3, sugar 3
  Thursday: oatmeal 4, peanut butter 5, sugar 4
  Friday: oatmeal 5, peanut butter 4, sugar 5
  
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of either oatmeal or sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is also made on Wednesday. Therefore, we can eliminate choice D, "Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday," since no batches of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.
  
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on a different day than the first batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of the one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday and the third batch of the other kind of cookie is made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  If the third batch of the other kind of cookie is made on Tuesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  If the third batch of the other kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then at least one batch of cookies is not made on Friday.
  Therefore, the statement that could be false is E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a schedule of when each batch of cookies is made.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can use the schedule to determine which batches are being referred to.
  For example, if oatmeal's first batch is made on the same day as sugar's third batch, then we know that oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday (since that's when sugar's third batch is made).
  We can then use this information to determine which statements could be false.
  If there are two batches of cookies made on Wednesday, then we know that peanut butter's first batch must be made on Wednesday (since that's the only day left with two batches of cookies to be made).
  Using this logic, we can determine that statement D (Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday) could be false.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We also know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then we can infer that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday or Tuesday, but on Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday as well. This means that no batches of cookies are made on Monday, which contradicts the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Wednesday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday or Friday, then the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday or Tuesday, respectively. This means that no batches of cookies are made on Monday, which again contradicts the condition that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  Now we can determine the schedule of batches for each kind of cookie:
  Monday: at least one batch
  Tuesday: oatmeal (2nd), peanut butter (1st), sugar (1st)
  Wednesday: oatmeal (3rd), peanut butter (2nd), sugar (2nd)
  Thursday: oatmeal (1st), peanut butter (3rd), sugar (3rd)
  Friday: at least one batch
  From this, we can see that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday (C) and exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday (D). Therefore, the answer is B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
Response 9:
Thought:
  We are given that the bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookies.
  Three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
    - Oatmeal 1 and Sugar 3 are made on the same day.
    - Peanut Butter 1 and Oatmeal 3 are made on the same day.
    - Sugar 1 and Peanut Butter 3 are made on the same day.
  We need to determine which statement could be false based on the given conditions.
  If Oatmeal 1 and Sugar 3 are made on the same day, then:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False)
    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True)
  If Peanut Butter 1 and Oatmeal 3 are made on the same day, then:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (True)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False)
    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True)
  If Sugar 1 and Peanut Butter 3 are made on the same day, then:
    - At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days. (True)
    - At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. (False)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. (False)
    - Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. (True)
    - Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. (True)

The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Veqemite performs in slot three, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than zircon
  C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy
  D: Yardsign performs in an earlier slot than, wellspring
  E: Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  This means that Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots one, two, or three.
  If Wellspring and Zircon perform in slots one, two, or three, then Xpert must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, then it must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
  The answer is C: Xpert performs in an earlier slot than Uneasy.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Wellspring must perform in slot three and Xpert must perform in slot five or six.
  If Zircon performs in slot five, then Wellspring must perform in slot three or four and Xpert must perform in slot six.
  If Zircon performs in slot six, then Wellspring must perform in slot three, four, or five and Xpert must perform in slot four or five.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  If Uneasy performs in slot four, five, or six, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, then Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  The answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot five or six.
  If Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, then Wellspring must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  If Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, then Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot three, since Vegemite is already performing in that slot.
  So, Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Wellspring must perform in slot two, and Xpert must perform in slot three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot one, and Xpert must perform in slot three.
  In either case, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, five, or six, then Wellspring must perform in slot two or three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two or three, then Xpert must perform in slot one or two.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  If Xpert performs in slot one, then Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  Therefore, if Vegemite performs in slot three, then Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  The answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Vegemite performs in slot three.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot four, five, or six.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert performs in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four or five or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot one or two or three.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot two or three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Wellspring performs in slot one, which violates the constraint that Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot three, then Wellspring performs in slot one, which means Zircon performs in slot four.
  Therefore, Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  The correct answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then slots one and two must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring, in some order.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four or five.
  If Uneasy performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in slot five and Uneasy in slot six.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 37 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth and the accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of the accomplices is: Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either first, second, fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of the accomplices is: Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of the accomplices is: Villas, Quinn, White, Rovero, Peters, Stanton, Tao.
  Therefore, it is possible that Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Peters was recruited fourth and the accomplices were recruited one at a time.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of these three accomplices must be White, Rovero, and Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited before White as well.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the order of the first four accomplices is Quinn, Peters, Villas, and White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, or sixth.
  The only option that works is C: Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, and the accomplices were recruited one at a time, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, A, B, C.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order is Peters, X, Y, Z, A, Villas, White.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be first or second.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order is Peters, X, Y, White, Rovero, Tao, Z.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited sixth.
  The answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn must be recruited either first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton must be recruited either first, second, fifth, or sixth.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters].
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is: [Villas, Quinn, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters].
  Therefore, B and D are possible.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment must be Peters and three others, then Villas and White, and then Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruitment must be Peters, someone, someone, someone, Villas, White, someone, then Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, someone, someone, someone, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, and Stanton.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be first.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, X, Y, Z, Villas, White, and Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth and White sixth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited third and Rovero second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must have been recruited first and X must have been recruited fourth.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment must be: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be recruited either first or second.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment is: [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters] or [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Peters].
  The only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Peters was recruited fourth and the accomplices were recruited one at a time, so Peters must have been recruited after the first three but before the last three.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must have been recruited fifth.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn cannot be recruited later than third.
  Therefore, Quinn must be recruited first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Stanton cannot be recruited second because Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn must be recruited second and Stanton cannot be recruited second.
  If Quinn was recruited second, then Rovero must be recruited third and Tao must be recruited sixth.
  Therefore, Rovero was recruited third and Tao was recruited sixth.
  The only option that is consistent with this information is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited last.
  Since Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, Stanton was recruited third or fifth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could not be recruited fifth.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero was recruited third and Stanton was recruited fifth. But this is impossible because Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited second, and Rovero was recruited third.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited fifth and Villas was recruited sixth.
  The only possible answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be: Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited before the 6th accomplice.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either first or second.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then Tao would have to be recruited 7th, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited second.
  The only remaining option is that Rovero was recruited third.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Rovero was recruited third.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than on the top shelf. Therefore, there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  We know that F is on the same shelf as M. Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that there are at least two books on each shelf. Therefore, the remaining books (besides F, M, K, O, and I) must be on the top or middle shelf.
  From the given options, the only possible combination of books that could be on the bottom shelf is F, H, and M. Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that K and O are on higher shelves than F and M, so they cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only books that could be on the bottom shelf are G, H, and L.
  The answer is E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We can use these two conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  A: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  B: F and M are on the same shelf, so this cannot be the bottom shelf.
  C: There are no books on the bottom shelf, so this cannot be the correct answer.
  D: This is a possibility because F and M can be on the bottom shelf, and G and O can be on the top shelf.
  E: There are no books on the bottom shelf, so this cannot be the correct answer.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, and K is on a higher shelf than F.
  We also know that I is placed on the middle shelf and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and E because they do not include any of the books that we know are on the middle shelf.
  We can also eliminate choice D because it includes O, which we know is not on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is A, which includes F and M, the two books that we know are on the same shelf.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the top shelf must have only two books.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so the top shelf must not have I.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that at least two books are placed on each shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least two books.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that the bottom shelf has either FH or HM.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be at least 3 books on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is also on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is also on the bottom shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F and M are on the same shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf with L.
  Therefore, the only books that could be on the bottom shelf are G, H, and L.
  The answer is E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  We do not know the exact number of books on each shelf, but we can eliminate choices that do not meet the conditions.
  Choice A cannot be correct because there must be more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Choice B cannot be correct because it does not include K, which must be on a higher shelf than F.
  Choice C cannot be correct because it does not include any of the books that are known to be on the middle shelf.
  Choice D could be correct because it includes all of the books except H that are not known to be on the middle shelf.
  Choice E cannot be correct because it does not include any of the books that are known to be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf. Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, if F is on the bottom shelf, then K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, if L is on the bottom shelf, then O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that each shelf has at least two books. Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and B since they only have two books on the bottom shelf.
  We can eliminate choice C since it does not include any of the books that are placed on the same shelf as F.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that M and F are on the same shelf and that shelf is not the bottom shelf because more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I is not on the top or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  From the above conditions, we can infer that the bottom shelf must have at least two books.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is B: F, H, M.

  Option A does not have the same effect because it does not mention N.
  Option B does not have the same effect because it mentions P instead of N.
  Option C does not have the same effect because it mentions P instead of N and it is the opposite of the original condition.
  Option D has the same effect because it mentions N and it is the opposite of the original condition.
  Option E does not have the same effect because it mentions N and O instead of M and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that would have the same effect on the schedule as the original condition.
  This means that we need to find a condition that would prevent M and N from being published in the same season.
  Choice A does not have the same effect because it does not involve M and N.
  Choice B does not have the same effect because it involves N and P, not M and N.
  Choice C does not have the same effect because it involves M and P, not M and N.
  Choice D has the same effect as the original condition because it involves M and N.
  Choice E does not have the same effect because it involves O and N, not M and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Therefore, we need to find a condition that would have the same effect as this.
  Option A talks about L and M, which is not relevant to the given condition.
  Option B talks about N and P, which is also not relevant to the given condition.
  Option C talks about M and P, which is already given in the initial conditions.
  Option D talks about N and M, which is the same as the given condition.
  Option E talks about O and N, which is not relevant to the given condition.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of wall 2.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 1 and Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 1.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that can be displayed in the upper position of wall 1 is Greene's oil.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then:
  - Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would violate the condition that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1 because it is the only painting left that has not been placed yet and it must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  - Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because that would violate the condition that no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. 
  We know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2. 
  We know that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3. 
  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know that Isaacs's oil is not on wall 4 because Isaacs cannot have both his oil and Franz's oil on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, we know that Greene's watercolor is on wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, we know that there must be an oil painting on wall 1.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, we know that the painting on wall 1 must be painted by either Hidalgo or Greene.
  Hidalgo's oil is not on wall 3 because we know that Franz's oil is on wall 3.
  Therefore, the only option left is that Greene's oil must be on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 1.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of wall 1.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and watercolor must be displayed on walls 3 and 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 4.
  But Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, then wall 1 must have a painting by Greene or Hidalgo.
  But wall 1 cannot have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, wall 1 must have a painting by Greene or Hidalgo that is not painted by Isaacs.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is Hidalgo's watercolor.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's paintings are on walls 2 and 4.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Franz's paintings are on walls 3 and either 1 or 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's watercolor is on wall 2.
  Hidalgo's paintings are not on walls 2, 3, or 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings are on wall 1.
  Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1 because no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  And we know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3, since Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Also, we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1, since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  The answer is A: Franz's watercolor.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the only possible project leader is Ruiz.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the only possible project leader is Ruiz.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the only possible project leader is Ruiz.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the only possible project leader is Smith.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the only possible project leader is Smith.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find a condition that completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. This means that Wells cannot be a project member since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be if Wells is a project member. However, we still have three workers left: Ruiz, Verma, and Xue, and we need to select three workers. Therefore, this condition does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected. This means that we cannot select Taylor since Smith must be selected if Taylor is selected. Therefore, we can only select two workers: Wells and either Ruiz or Verma. We cannot determine who the project leader will be. Therefore, this condition does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we must select Smith, Taylor, and either Wells or Ruiz. If we select Wells, then we cannot select Ruiz since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be if Wells is a project member. Therefore, Ruiz must be the project leader. If we select Ruiz, then we cannot select Wells or Verma. Therefore, Xue must be the project leader. Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we must select Smith, Taylor, and either Quinn or Ruiz. If we select Quinn, then Quinn must be the project leader. If we select Ruiz, then Ruiz must be the project leader. Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we must select Smith, Taylor, and either Wells or Ruiz. If we select Wells, then we cannot select Ruiz since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be if Wells is a project member. Therefore, Ruiz must be the project leader. If we select Ruiz, then we cannot select Wells or Verma. Therefore, Xue must be the project leader. Therefore, this condition completely determines the selection for the project.
  
  The only conditions that completely determine the selection for the project are C and E.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  We need to determine which option will completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, since Smith is a member.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, since Taylor must be a member.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have multiple possibilities for the project members and leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we still have multiple possibilities for the project members and leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be a member, and Smith and Taylor must also be members. Since Wells cannot be the leader, either Quinn or Ruiz must be the leader. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, option A is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. This violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, option B is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, there are still four candidates left for three positions. We cannot determine the selection based on this information. Therefore, option C is not the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be selected. However, this still leaves three candidates for two positions, and we cannot determine the selection based on this information. Therefore, option D is not the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Wells must be selected. This means that Smith and Taylor must also be selected, leaving only Quinn and Xue as the remaining candidates. Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, this means that Ruiz must be the project leader, and Quinn and Xue are the other project members. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected. This means that only one person, Wells, can be selected and he cannot be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected. This means that only one person, Wells, can be selected and he cannot be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are still 5 people to choose from for the 3 spots. However, we still don't know who the project leader will be. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then either Quinn or Taylor must be the project leader. We know that Smith must be selected if Taylor is selected. Therefore, if Taylor is selected, then Smith must also be selected. This leaves only one spot for Verma, Xue, or Quinn. If Taylor is not selected, then Smith cannot be selected, but we still have 3 people to choose from for the 2 spots. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader. However, we know that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member. This means that only one person, Wells, can be selected and he cannot be the project leader. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three workers will be selected to be project members.
  We also know that exactly one of these project members will be the project leader.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  To determine the selection for the project, we need to check all the options and see which one of them will help us to select the three workers and the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we can select Taylor as the project leader and Wells as the third member. However, we cannot select the second member as we cannot select Quinn or Ruiz without the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we can select Smith as the project leader and Wells and Xue as the other two members. However, we cannot select the second member as we cannot select Taylor without Smith.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we can select Smith as the project leader and Wells and Taylor as the other two members. However, we cannot select the second member as we cannot select Xue without Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we can select Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members. However, we cannot select the third member as we cannot select Wells without selecting either Ruiz or Verma.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can select Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as the other two members. Then, we can select either Wells or Xue as the third member.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, A is not true.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, B is not true.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, it is possible to select Smith, Taylor, and Wells as project members. However, it is not clear who the project leader will be, as Quinn and Ruiz are the only ones who can be project members and leaders. Therefore, C is not true.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, it is possible to select any three of the remaining workers as project members, and any one of them as the leader. Therefore, D is true.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, it is possible to select Smith, Taylor, and Wells as project members, and Wells as the leader. Therefore, E is not true.
  The selection for the project is completely determined if D is true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, this option is not possible.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith can't be a project member, which violates the constraint that if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. So, this option is not possible.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are only five workers left, and we need to select three of them. Since Quinn and Xue are not selected, the only possible leader would be Ruiz. However, if Ruiz is the leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz would have to be a project member, which violates the constraint that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. So, this option is not possible.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then Verma must be a project member. However, if Verma is a project member, then Wells cannot be, which violates the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, this option is not possible.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then there are only five workers left, and we need to select three of them. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, the only possible leader would be Quinn. In this case, we can select Taylor and Wells as the other two project members, and all the constraints will be satisfied. So, this option is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz if either of them is a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  We need to check which of the options will allow us to select three project members and one project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we cannot select a project leader from them. So, this option is not valid.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we cannot have Quinn or Ruiz as a project leader. So, this option is not valid.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we can have Quinn or Ruiz as a project leader and select two other members. So, this option is valid.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we can have Quinn as a project leader and select two other members. So, this option is valid.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can have Quinn as a project leader and select two other members. So, this option is valid.
  Options C, D, and E are valid. 
  We need to select the option that will completely determine the selection for the project. 
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we can have Quinn or Ruiz as a project leader and select two other members. So, this option is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  To determine the answer, we need to check which constraint will allow us to select exactly three workers and a project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which means Smith cannot be selected. Therefore, we cannot select exactly three workers and a project leader. This option is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected. Therefore, we cannot select exactly three workers and a project leader. This option is not correct.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we can select any three workers from the remaining five workers. We can then select one of the three workers as the project leader. This option is correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we can select Quinn and Taylor, along with one of the remaining three workers as the third project member and leader. This option is not correct.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we cannot select Wells as a project member. Therefore, we cannot select exactly three workers and a project leader. This option is not correct.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Also, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone as well.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, if Parra works in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then it is possible that both of them work in Zone 3.
  The only answer choice that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Udall must work in the other zone, which is Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only seven sales representatives, and Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall are already assigned to zones.
  Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 3, which means there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Parra must work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  The only remaining sales representative is Mahr, who can work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  Therefore, A, B, C, and E are possible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which means that at least 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3. Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 3. So, Parra and Tiao both work in Zone 1. 
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1. Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are only three sales representatives in Zone 2 and Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone. Therefore, Kim works in Zone 3. 
  The only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  The only remaining option is Kim working in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Quinn works in Zone 1.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there are three sales representatives in Zone 3 and two sales representatives in Zone 2.
  Kim is the only sales representative left to assign to a zone. Therefore, Kim works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Udall must work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey are working in Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is impossible for Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey to all work in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, and the other one must work in Zone 2. This means that Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey are working in Zone 1 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, it is possible for Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey to all work in Zone 3. Therefore, Udall works in Zone 3, and Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey are working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  Parra must work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao already works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra.
  Kim is the only sales representative who has not been assigned to a sales zone.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim must work in Zone 3.
  The only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Parra works in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 3.
  Kim works in Zone 2 because Tiao works in Zone 2 and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  If either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Quinn works in Zone 1 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Since there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey because Udall already works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Udall must work in a different sales zone than Mahr and Stuckey.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so either Mahr or Stuckey must work in Zone 3.
  If Mahr works in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  However, there are only two sales representatives left to work in Zone 2, which is not possible because Udall and Tiao cannot both work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey works in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn must also work in Zone 3 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are only two sales representatives left to work in Zone 2, so Udall must work in Zone 2.
  Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because Udall already works in Zone 2 and either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra must work in Zone 1 and Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall already works in Zone 2.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  From the constraint, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  From the constraint, T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  From the constraint, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 4 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  From the constraint, W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Also, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4 because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 and X must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  This leaves R to be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: R is mentioned in chapter 3 or D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, the only possible order for chapters 1 and 2 is X, U.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, the possible order for chapters 1 through 4 is X, U, T, R or X, U, T, S.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4, so W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or later.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X must be mentioned in chapter 1, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  Therefore, the only possible order for chapters 5 and 7 is R, Z or Z, R.
  Therefore, the only possible order for chapters 1 through 7 is X, U, T, S, R, W, Z.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 because R must be mentioned after S.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: R is mentioned in chapter 3 or B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 6 or chapter 7.
  R can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: R is mentioned in chapter 7 or E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later, and Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4, and T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  There must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 5.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S and Z must be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, 6, or 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 2, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 7.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 6.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 7.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 6, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 6.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3, which is not possible.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and S must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 3, and R must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  The answer is E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1 and U is mentioned in chapter 2, then R and S cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Thus, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  The only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1 and U is mentioned in chapter 2, then the only possible order of clues is:
  Chapter 1: X
  Chapter 2: U
  Chapter 3: R or S or Z
  Chapter 4: S or R or Z
  Chapter 5: T
  Chapter 6: W
  Chapter 7: Z or R or S
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7, S could be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, Z could be mentioned in chapter 3 or 7, and T could be mentioned in chapter 5.
  The only option that fits is B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.

  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, if Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that R is mentioned in chapter 7.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by photographers other than Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Based on the above information, the only possible scenario is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes. One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes. One photograph in the Sports section is by Hue and one photograph in the Sports section is by a photographer other than Gagnon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of them can be in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the section that includes Gagnon's photographs must be in either the Lifestyle section or the Metro section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the other section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the other section cannot be by Hue.
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue. - Not possible because at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. - Possible because both photographs in the other section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - Not possible because both photographs in the section that includes Gagnon's photographs must be in either the Lifestyle section or the Metro section.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. - Not possible because neither of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - Not possible because the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
Answer: Answer("B")

Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro sections.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
  This leaves us with two possibilities:
    1. Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Fuentes and Hue.
    2. One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the two photographs by Gagnon must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon, then there would be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes, then there must be one photograph in the Sports section by Hue.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be different from the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there would be no photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Gagnon, then there would be no photograph in the Sports section by Hue, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one section are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section are not by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes or Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if both photographs in one section are by Gagnon, then both photographs in the Sports section are not by Gagnon.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section are by Fuentes and Hue.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue or Fuentes.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B")

  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon, then there will be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, A is not true.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there will be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, B is not true.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there will be no photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, C is not true.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there will be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, D could be true.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. However, we do not know how many photographs Fuentes has in the Sports section, so we cannot determine if this is true. Therefore, E is not necessarily true.
  
Action: Answer("D")

Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Gagnon's photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections must be 1 or 2.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and the other must be by Hue.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, this is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there would be no photograph by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, this is not possible.

  - The other photographer who has photographs in that section cannot be Gagnon.
  - The other photographer who has photographs in that section cannot be Fuentes.
  - The other photographer who has photographs in that section can be Hue.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Therefore, the only possible section where Gagnon could have two photographs is the Lifestyle section.
  - If Gagnon has two photographs in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section.
  - Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section and one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  Let's use the process of elimination to determine which answer could be true.
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the sundial is auctioned before the mirror.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the sundial is auctioned before the vase.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is not possible because the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st and the lamp would have to be auctioned after the harmonica.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica could be auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.

Answer: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase.
  We need to find a possible date for one of the antiques.
  
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. If the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 6th, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd.
  
  Therefore, the mirror could be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd.
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd to June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the mirror and the vase are auctioned on June 3rd to June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror are auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd to June 6th.
  Based on the above reasoning, the following could be true:
    - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (Possible)
    - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. (Possible)
    - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. (Not possible)
    - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. (Not possible)
    - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. (Possible)
  Therefore, the answer is A, B, and E. 
Action: Answer("A, B, E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  
  Let's use the process of elimination to determine which statement could be true:
  - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This cannot be true since the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and the sundial is auctioned before the mirror.
  - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This cannot be true since the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, and we don't know the order of the harmonica and the lamp.
  - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This cannot be true since the sundial is auctioned before the vase.
  - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This could be true if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, the table is auctioned on June 2nd, the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, the vase is auctioned on June 5th, and the mirror is auctioned on June 6th.
  - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This cannot be true since the mirror must be auctioned before the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, and we don't know the order of the harmonica and the lamp.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find a possible auction date for one of the items.
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some options.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. So, the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th, and the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  Based on the above conditions, we can eliminate options A, C, and E.
  The only remaining options are B and D.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd. This satisfies all the given conditions, so option B could be true.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This violates the condition that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, option D cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of the auctions.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd or later, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Using these conditions, we can create a schedule:
  
  June 1st: Table
  June 2nd: Sundial, Harmonica or Mirror
  June 3rd: Mirror or Harmonica, Vase
  June 4th: Lamp
  June 5th: Vase or Mirror
  June 6th: Lamp or Harmonica
  
  Now we can check each choice against the schedule:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is possible.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is not possible. The lamp is auctioned on June 4th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is not possible. The vase is auctioned on June 3rd or June 5th.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. - This is not possible. The lamp is auctioned on June 4th.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. - This is possible.
  
  Therefore, the answer is either A or E. However, we can't be sure which one is true, so we will select the most likely answer, which is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it is auctioned on one of the days from June 2nd to June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. Therefore, the mirror and the vase are both auctioned on one of the days from June 3rd to June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, as the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th, as both the harmonica and the vase could be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.

  From the given conditions, we can create a chart to keep track of the possible order of the auctions:
  
| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|     | S | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
  
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  
| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|     | S |   |   |   |   |   |
  
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  
| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|     | S | T |   |   |   |   |
  
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp and the mirror must be auctioned on June 6th.
  
| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|     | S | T | H | L | M | V |
  
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  
| Day | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| --- | - | - | - | - | - | - |
|     | S | T | H | L | M | V |
  
  Therefore, the only possible order of the auctions is: June 1st - table, June 2nd - sundial, June 3rd - harmonica, June 4th - lamp, June 5th - mirror, June 6th - vase.
  From the given choices, the lamp could be auctioned on June 3rd.
  Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  From the conditions, we know that:
  - Sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - Sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - Table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
    - This violates the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    - Therefore, A is not true.
    
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st.
    - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st.
    - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    - The vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
    - This satisfies all the conditions, so B could be true.
    
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
    - If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
    - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    - This violates the condition that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
    - Therefore, C is not true.
    
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
    - If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
    - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
    - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
    - The vase must be auctioned on June 5th or later.
    - This satisfies all the conditions, so D could be true.
    
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
    - If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
    - The table must be auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, which means the table must be auctioned on June 1st or 2nd.
    - The sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase, which means the sundial must be auctioned on June 3rd or later.
    - The vase must be auctioned on June 4th or later.
    - This violates the condition that the harmonica and the lamp are auctioned on June 6th.
    - Therefore, E is not true.
    
  Based on the above analysis, B and D could be true.
  
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We need to check which of the given options is consistent with these conditions.
  Option A is not possible because the mirror cannot be auctioned before the harmonica.
  Option B is not possible because the lamp cannot be auctioned before the harmonica.
  Option C is not possible because the vase cannot be auctioned before the sundial.
  Option D is possible because the lamp can be auctioned after the harmonica and before the mirror.
  Option E is not possible because the mirror cannot be auctioned after the table.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know which buildings are owned by each company and their respective classes.
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, no matter how many trades are made.
  We can eliminate options A and D because they mix up the buildings owned by different companies.
  Option B is impossible because it would mean Southco owns a class 1 and a class 2 building, but Southco only owns one class 1 or class 2 building.
  Option C is impossible because it would mean Southco owns three buildings, but Southco only owns two buildings.
  This leaves us with option E, which is the answer.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be of exactly one of the three kinds.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because RealProp does not own any of them.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco can be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building because they are of different classes and can be traded using the second kind of trade.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because Southco does not own the King Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Flores Tower and the Yates House because they are of different classes and cannot be traded using any of the three kinds of trades.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building because they are of different classes and cannot be traded using any of the three kinds of trades.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  A trade of class 1 building can only be made for two class 2 buildings or one class 1 building.
  A trade of class 2 building can only be made for two class 3 buildings or one class 1 building.
  A trade of class 3 building can only be made for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, it is not possible for RealProp to own the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, which is option A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We can start by looking at the buildings owned by each company and their respective classes.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  We need to determine which option is impossible, regardless of the trades made.
  Option A is impossible because the buildings owned by RealProp are all either class 1 or class 3, while the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2.
  Option B is possible because Southco owns the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Meyer Building (class 2).
  Option C is impossible because the buildings owned by Southco are either class 1 or class 2, while the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2.
  Option D is impossible because the Yates House is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp.
  Option E is impossible because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, not Trustcorp.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House.
  Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  Trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes as specified.
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, no matter how many trades are made.
  A: RealProp cannot own buildings that are owned by Trustcorp.
  B: Southco cannot own both Garza Tower and Meyer Building because they are of different classes and cannot be traded.
  C: Southco cannot own buildings that are owned by Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp cannot own both Flores Tower and Yates House because they are of different classes and cannot be traded.
  E: Trustcorp cannot own buildings that are owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  The Yates House and the Zimmer House are both class 3 buildings owned by RealProp.
  The only way to trade a class 3 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the Yates House and the Zimmer House can only be traded for two other class 3 buildings.
  The Garza Tower is the only class 1 building.
  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the Garza Tower can only be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Lynch Building is the only remaining class 2 building.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the Lynch Building can only be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Based on the above analysis, we can eliminate options A, B, C, and E.
  The only option left is D.
  It is impossible for Trustcorp to own the Flores Tower and the Yates House because the Flores Tower is a class 1 building and the Yates House is a class 3 building.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  We cannot trade a class 1 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Garza Tower (class 1) cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  So, Garza Tower (class 1) must be traded for either a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  The Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3) can be traded for two class 2 buildings or two class 3 buildings.
  Flores Tower (class 1) can be traded for either a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  Lynch Building (class 2) can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2) can be traded for one building of the same class or two class 3 buildings.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own King Building.
  D cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own Yates House.
  E can be true because Trustcorp owns Lynch Building and RealProp owns Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We can start by identifying the buildings owned by each company and their respective classes.
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  We can also determine that a class 1 building can be traded for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true since RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This cannot be true since Southco does not own Garza Tower.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This cannot be true since Southco does not own King Building or Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This can be true since Trustcorp can own these buildings, but it is not explicitly stated.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This cannot be true since Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).

  The only way to trade a class 1 building is to trade it for two class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, it is impossible for a company to own both a class 1 and a class 3 building.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of these buildings.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. - This can be true because Southco can trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for the Garza Tower (class 1) and the Yates House (class 3) for the Meyer Building (class 2).
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. - This cannot be true because Southco does not own any of these buildings.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. - This can be true because Trustcorp can trade the King Building (class 2) for the Yates House (class 3) and the Ortiz Building (class 2) for the Flores Tower (class 1).
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. - This cannot be true because Trustcorp does not own either of these buildings.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays
Response 0:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available - Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate options C, D, and E as they do not assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  Option A violates the constraint that Gonzalez and Lai cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  Option B assigns Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies all the constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  We need to find a complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony that satisfies all the constraints.
  
  If Frost and Heideck are assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then Gonzalez must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Since Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, Mays cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Mays must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. Finally, Knutson cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so he must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. This assignment satisfies all the constraints.
  
  The complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is: Frost, Gonzalez, Mays, and Knutson.
  
  Therefore, the answer is A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
  Exactly six photographers are available.
  We need to assign photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  From the given choices, we can see that choice A, B, and D have Frost and Heideck assigned to the Silva University ceremony. 
  However, choice A has four photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which violates the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  Choice B has three photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  Choice D has two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  Choice C and E do not have Gonzalez assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  Let's go through each of the choices to see which one could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
    Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so they can't both be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
    If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez can't be assigned without Lai.
    If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson can't be left out.
    Therefore, this is not a possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
    
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
    Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies, so they can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony together.
    If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez can't be assigned without Lai.
    Therefore, this is a possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
    
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
    If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez can't be assigned without Lai.
    Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson can't be left out.
    Therefore, this is not a possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
    
  D: Heideck, Lai
    Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies, so Frost can't be left out.
    If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez can't be assigned without Lai.
    Therefore, this is not a possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
    
  E: Knutson, Mays
    If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson can't be left out.
    Therefore, this is not a possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony.
    
  The only possible assignment for the Silva University ceremony is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:

  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option C since it only assigns two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option D since it does not assign Frost to the ceremony.
  We can eliminate option E since it does not assign Heideck to the ceremony.
  Option A assigns Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, and Knutson to the ceremony, but we cannot assign Frost and Heideck together to the Silva University ceremony, so we can eliminate this option.
  Option B assigns Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck to the ceremony, and this satisfies all the constraints given in the problem.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, and five other accomplices.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton must be either the first or the last of the five other accomplices.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be either the second or the third accomplice.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be either the fourth or the fifth accomplice.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters cannot be the second or the third accomplice.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment is: Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited third, the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, Rovero, Stanton, and White.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Stanton, and Rovero, which violates the rule that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, the order would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, White, Stanton, Villas, and Rovero, which violates the rule that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited third, the order would be Peters, Tao, White, Quinn, Villas, Stanton, and Rovero, which violates the rule that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, the only possible order is Peters, Tao, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton.
  The answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was not recruited third or first.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first, second, or third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, if White was recruited sixth, then Villas was recruited fifth.
  Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, Quinn, ?, ?, ?, ?.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, ?, ?, Rovero, ?, ?.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, ?, ?, ?, Stanton, ?.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, ?, ?, ?, Villas, White.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is Peters, Tao, White, ?, ?, ?, ?.
  Therefore, the answer is E: White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Tao was recruited second.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn was not recruited after Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas was not recruited after White.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be Tao, Quinn, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, and Stanton.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn must have been recruited third.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:

  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1. unknown
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. unknown
  6. unknown
  7. unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment could be:
  1. Quinn
  2. Tao
  3. unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Rovero
  6. Villas
  7. White
  If this is the order, then Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Villas was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, White was recruited fifth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited either first, second, or third.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then Rovero must be recruited sixth.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then Stanton must be recruited sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then Villas must be recruited seventh.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, 3, Peters, 5, 6, 7].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn could be recruited third or earlier.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White could be recruited seventh or earlier.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, Quinn, Peters, 5, 6, 7]. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, 3, Peters, Quinn, Rovero, 7]. This violates the condition that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, 3, Peters, Quinn, Stanton, 7]. This violates the condition that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, 3, Peters, Quinn, Villas, White]. This satisfies all the given conditions.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1, Tao, White, Peters, Quinn, 6, 7]. This violates the condition that Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, A and D could be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao was not recruited immediately before Peters.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White and Peters was recruited third, then Villas was not recruited immediately before Peters.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Quinn was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first or fourth.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then Rovero was recruited fifth, and Stanton was recruited sixth.
  If Quinn was recruited fourth, then Rovero was recruited sixth, and Stanton was recruited fifth.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then White was recruited seventh.
  Therefore, the only plausible option is A: Quinn was recruited third.

  7. unknown
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be recruited third.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be recruited sixth.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Rovero cannot be recruited fifth.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")

  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Unknown
  4. Peters
  5. Unknown
  6. Unknown
  7. Unknown
  From the given information, we know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, and Peters was recruited fourth. Therefore, the order of recruitment must be one of the following:
  1. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Rovero, Villas, White or
  2. Quinn, Tao, Peters, Unknown, Villas, Rovero, White
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then the order of recruitment must be the second option.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Villas was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the first three recruits is unknown.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be third.
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then White must be recruited seventh, so Villas cannot be sixth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Stanton was recruited either third, fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton cannot be third.
  Therefore, Stanton was either fourth, fifth, or sixth.

Thought:
  Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, Truvest's voicemail target is longer than its website target.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target, which is already shorter than Truvest's voicemail target.
  This means that Solide's voicemail target must be at least 2 days, as it cannot be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y and therefore must be first, second, or third.
  Q cannot be first or second because S must be earlier than Q.
  If Q is third, then G must be first and J must be second.
  R must be sixth because G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, H must be fifth and J must be third.
  The only statement that must be true is that J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Q cannot be second because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  Therefore, Q must be first or third.
  If Q is first, then R must be fifth and G must be sixth, which means J must be seventh. But this is not possible because S must be earlier than Y.
  Therefore, Q must be third.
  If Q is third, then S must be first or second.
  If S is first, then R must be fourth, G must be fifth, and J must be sixth, which means Y must be seventh. But this is not possible because S must be earlier than Y.
  Therefore, S must be second.
  If S is second, then R must be fourth, G must be fifth, and J must be sixth, which means Q must be first and Y must be seventh.
  Therefore, J is sixth.
  The only answer choice that is true is E: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles is Q, R, S, Y, ?, ?, ?.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, R must be either sixth or seventh.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. Therefore, the sixth article must cover wildlife.
  The order of the articles is Q, R, S, Y, ?, ?, W.
  S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, W must be either G or H.
  If W is G, then J must be second, and H must be fifth. This violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  Therefore, W is H, and J is third.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles is either SQHJGRY or QSHJGRY.
  J must be earlier than G, so the order is SQHJGRY.
  G must be earlier than R, so the order is SQHJGRY.
  S must be earlier than Y, so the order is SQHJGRY.
  Therefore, Q must be third.
  The only option that is true is D: Q is third.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y and therefore S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. This is not possible because Q and R cannot be consecutive articles.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means R must be sixth and G must be seventh. This is not possible because Q and R cannot be consecutive articles.
  If S is third, then Q can be first or second. If Q is first, then R must be fourth, G must be fifth, and J must be seventh. This satisfies all the conditions, and therefore Q is first and J is seventh.
  Therefore, the answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  Since Q can only be third if S is earlier, then Q cannot be third.
  Therefore, Q must be either first or second.
  If Q is first, then R must be sixth and G must be fifth.
  If Q is second, then R must be fifth and G must be sixth.
  Since J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, then J must be either first or second.
  If J is first, then H must be fifth and G must be sixth.
  If J is second, then H must be sixth and G must be fifth.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J must be either first or second.
  The answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  Since Q can only be third if S is earlier than Q, then Q must be fourth, fifth, or sixth.
  Since G must be earlier than R, then G cannot be seventh. Therefore, G must be first, second, or third.
  Since the articles are edited one at a time and consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, the order must be: S, G, Q, Y, H, R, J.
  Therefore, J is either second or third.
  The only option that is consistent with this order is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, but this would violate the condition that S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  If S is second, then Q must be first, which would mean that G and R would have to be fourth and fifth, but this would violate the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, S must be third.
  If S is third, then Q must be first, and G and R must be fourth and fifth, but we don't know the order of H and J yet.
  However, we do know that J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be fifth.
  Therefore, J must be second or third.
  If J is second, then H must be sixth and Y must be seventh, but this would violate the condition that S must be earlier than Y.
  Therefore, J is third.
  If J is third, then G must be fourth and R must be fifth.
  Therefore, Q is first.
  The only remaining answer choice that could be true is E, which says that R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y and cannot be fourth.
  Therefore, S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. This violates the rule that S must be earlier than Q if Q is third. Therefore, S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. This satisfies the rule that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S is second and Q is third.
  If S is third, then Q must be first or second. This violates the rule that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S cannot be third.
  Since S is second and Q is third, the next article must be an article on finance. G must be earlier than R, so G must be fourth. Therefore, the order of the articles is SQG followed by three articles on nutrition, and Y is last.
  Therefore, J must be earlier than G and G must be earlier than R. Since G is fourth, J must be second and R must be fifth.
  The only answer that is true is E: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which violates the rule that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  Therefore, S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means the first article must be either G or H.
  If S is third, then Q can be either first or third, which means the first article can be either G or H.
  If Y is fourth and S is third, then the order of the articles must be: SQHGJRY.
  Therefore, J is earlier than G, which means J cannot be second.
  If J is third, then G must be fourth, which violates the rule that G must be earlier than R.
  Therefore, J cannot be third.
  If J is first, then G must be second, which means the order of the articles must be: JGHQRSY.
  Therefore, Q is third.
  The answer is D: Q is third.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?

  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery
  C: the western, the horror film
  D: the western, the mystery
  E: the western, the sci-fi film
Response 0:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
  The answer is A: the sci-fi film, the horror film.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1, either at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M.
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1.
  If the western is shown at 9 P.M. on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown at 7 P.M. on screen 2.
  Therefore, the list of movies that CANNOT be shown on screen 1 is the one that includes the horror film and the western at the same time.
  The answer is C: the western, the horror film.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  If the western is shown on screen 1, then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the western cannot be shown on screen 1 with the horror film.
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 with the sci-fi film.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - Possible.
  C: the western, the horror film - Possible.
  D: the western, the mystery - Possible.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film - The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 with the western.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the sci-fi film, the horror film.

Response 3:
Thought:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. and the mystery on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  The only option that violates this condition is B: the sci-fi film, the mystery.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. because it must be shown before the horror film, which cannot be shown on screen 1. So, the answer is C: the western, the horror film.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the possible movies that can be shown on screen 1 are the western, the horror film, and the mystery.
  If the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  If the western is shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M., then the horror film must be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.
  Therefore, the only possible accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening are:
    - the western, the horror film
    - the horror film, the western
  Choice B, C, D, and E can all be accurate lists of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening.
  Therefore, the answer is A: the sci-fi film, the horror film.
Action: Answer("A")

  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The western cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot both be shown on screen 1.
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - The western must be shown before the horror film, so this is possible.
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - The western must be shown before the horror film, so this is possible.
  C: the western, the horror film - This is possible, as the western can be shown on screen 1 and the horror film on screen 2.
  D: the western, the mystery - This is possible, as the western can be shown on screen 1 and the mystery on screen 2.
  E: the western, the sci-fi film - This is possible, as the western can be shown on screen 1 and the sci-fi film on screen 2.
  All of the choices seem possible.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the horror film and the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 together.
  The western must be shown on screen 1 before the horror film.
  Therefore, the western and the mystery cannot be shown together on screen 1.
  Choice A is possible because the sci-fi film and the horror film can be shown on screen 1 together.
  Choice B is possible because the sci-fi film and the mystery can be shown on screen 1 together.
  Choice C is possible because the western and the horror film can be shown on screen 1 together.
  Choice D is possible because the western and the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 together.
  Choice E is not possible because the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the answer is E: the western, the sci-fi film.

  To determine which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, we need to use the given conditions.
  Screen 1 and Screen 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.

  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 1, then neither the horror film nor the mystery can be shown on screen 1 as they need to be shown on different screens.
  Therefore, the only possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening is the western and either the horror film or the mystery.
  Choice B: the sci-fi film, the mystery cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening as the mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 with the sci-fi film.

Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can infer the following:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (Not mentioned in the given conditions)
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Not possible as there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2)
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Possible)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Possible)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (Not mentioned in the given conditions)
  
  Therefore, the answer is either A or E. But as we need to select the option that must be false, the answer is A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. 
  
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  According to the given conditions:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Let's try to eliminate the options:
  Option A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible as there are seven sales representatives and only three sales zones.
  Option B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible as there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. This is not possible as Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible because we know that there are seven sales representatives and three sales zones. However, this is not a must be true statement. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is not possible because we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, B must be false.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, E must be false.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  From the given conditions:
    Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
    Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
    Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
    Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
    There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We can make the following deductions:
    If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
    If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
    If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 3.
    If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall works in Zone 1 and Parra works in Zone 3.
    If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2 or Udall works in Zone 2.
    If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2 or Udall works in Zone 2.
    If Stuckey works in Zone 3, then Udall works in Zone 3, and Tiao and Parra work in either Zone 1 or Zone 2.
    If Mahr works in Zone 3, then there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  Using these deductions, we can evaluate each statement:
    A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (This is possible if Parra works in Zone 2, Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false.)
    B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is not possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, this statement must be false.)
    C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible if there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false.)
    D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (This is possible if there are at least two sales representatives working in Zone 3. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily false.)
    E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (This is not possible because Parra works in either Zone 1 or Zone 3, and Stuckey works in either Zone 2 or Zone 3. Therefore, this statement must be false.)
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1. This contradicts the first condition. Therefore, A must be false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao). This contradicts the first condition. Therefore, B must be false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao). This contradicts the first condition. Therefore, C must be false.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1 (either Parra or Tiao). This contradicts the first condition. Therefore, D must be false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2. This contradicts the second condition. Therefore, E must be false.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This means that there is no sales representative who works in both Zone 1 and Zone 2. Also, we know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible because there are seven sales representatives and only three sales zones. 
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. This is not possible because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in a different sales zone. 
  The answer is E. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  From the given conditions:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A must be false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Therefore, B must be false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, C must be false.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there would be no sales representative left to work in Zone 2, which contradicts the given condition that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, D must be false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one sales representative left to work in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, E must be false.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.

  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (Possible)
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (Possible)
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. (Parra works in Zone 1, so this is possible.)

  Therefore, the answer is either C or D. 

Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  From the given conditions:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. 
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there will be only one sales representative left for Zone 3, which is less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2. So, A is not false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, B can be true.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, C can be true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, D can be true.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there will be only one sales representative left for Zone 3, which is less than the number of sales representatives working in Zone 2. So, E is not false.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  - More representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Let's evaluate each choice:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1, and neither Kim nor Stuckey are mentioned as working in any other zone.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible, as there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are seven representatives in total.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible, as there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are seven representatives in total.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible, as there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there are seven representatives in total.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is not possible because only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1, and Stuckey is mentioned as working in the same zone as Udall.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:

  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  Therefore, Image's website target is 1 day.
  Solide's website target is 2 days.
  Solide's voicemail target cannot be 2 days because it is longer than Image's voicemail target.
  Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is (C) Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find the option that is false given that none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then Image's voicemail target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target cannot be 3 days.
  Solide's voicemail target cannot be 3 days as none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days.
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 1 day. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days.
  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, the option that is false is A: Image's website target is 1 day because Image's website target can be 2 days if its voicemail target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.

  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Solide's website target is 1 day.
  Truvest's website target can be either 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's website target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Solide's voicemail target must be 1 day, which violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, Image's voicemail target is 1 day.
  If Solide's website target is 1 day, then Truvest's website target must be 2 days, which satisfies the condition that Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, Solide's website target is 2 days and Truvest's website target is 3 days.
  The only statement that is not necessarily true is statement A: Image's website target is 1 day. It is possible that Image's website target is 2 days.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  We need to determine which of the following could be true.
  From the given conditions, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then he must also have a photograph in the Metro section.
  If Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then he may or may not have a photograph in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then he must also have a photograph in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon cannot have both photographs in the Metro section.
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. - This cannot be true because Fuentes has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, so he cannot have both photographs in the Metro section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. - This cannot be true because none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so he must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. - This could be true because Hue may or may not have a photograph in the Metro section, but if he does, he can only have one.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. - This cannot be true because Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. - This could be true because Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section, and the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, if Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section, then Hue cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  
Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Response 1:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has no photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is already by Fuentes.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon or Hue.
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Gagnon.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue,
  then there are no photographs in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon.
  Also, there must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  If the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes is accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes,
  then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be equal to the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section, which is one each.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Gagnon.
  If the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue is accompanied by a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes,
  then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be equal to the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section, which is one each.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Gagnon.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section could be by Fuentes or Gagnon, or exactly one photograph in the Metro section could be by Hue.
  Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
  The answer is either A, B, or C.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue and Fuentes.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  The other photograph in the Metro section can be by any of the three photographers.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section can be by Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
  Choice A and B are not necessarily true.
  Choice C is possible.
  Choice D is true.
  Choice E is not true.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph by the same photographer in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  Also, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes, and the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes, and both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Metro section cannot be determined from the given information.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one must be by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, so either Fuentes or Hue must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is one.
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is one.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Metro section, and it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  However, we cannot determine which photographs are in the Metro and Sports sections, so we cannot determine whether A, B, D, or E are true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the third photographer, Gagnon, must have both photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Gagnon.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  The other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one of the photographers must have two photos in the Metro section.
  Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the only possibility is that both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  The answer is B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Since each section has exactly two photographs, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has no photographs in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's two photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Hue's one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be matched with Fuentes' one photograph in the Sports section.
  We have two cases:
  Case 1: Fuentes has one photograph in the Metro section.
    In this case, Gagnon must have one photograph in the Lifestyle section, and the other photograph in the Metro section.
    Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section are not by Fuentes.
    The answer is B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  Case 2: Fuentes has two photographs in the Metro section.
    In this case, Gagnon must have two photographs in the Lifestyle section.
    Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
    Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 58 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable selection of scientists for the panel?
Choices:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q
  B: G, H, K, L, M
  C: G, H, K, L, R
  D: H, K, M, P, R
  E: H, L, M, P, Q
Response 0:
Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  Option A includes two botanists and only one zoologist, which violates the second condition.
  Option B includes no botanist, which violates the first condition.
  Option C includes two chemists and no botanist, which violates the first condition.
  Option D satisfies all the conditions and includes one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  Option E includes no botanist and violates the first condition.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: H, K, M, P, R.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we need to choose at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, we can choose at most one botanist and at least one zoologist.
  F and K cannot both be selected. Therefore, if we select F, we cannot select K, and vice versa.
  K and M cannot both be selected. Therefore, if we select M, we cannot select K.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, if we select M, we must also select P and R.
  Now, let's check each option:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q - violates the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  B: G, H, K, L, M - violates the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.
  C: G, H, K, L, R - satisfies all conditions. We have one botanist (G), two chemists (K and L), and two zoologists (H and R).
  D: H, K, M, P, R - satisfies all conditions. We have one botanist (H), two chemists (K and M), and two zoologists (P and R).
  E: H, L, M, P, Q - violates the condition that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  Therefore, the acceptable selection of scientists for the panel is either C: G, H, K, L, R or D: H, K, M, P, R.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  Option A: Includes only one botanist and no zoologist. Not acceptable.
  Option B: Includes one botanist, one zoologist, and one chemist. Acceptable.
  Option C: Includes one botanist and one zoologist. Not acceptable.
  Option D: Includes one botanist, one zoologist, and one chemist. Acceptable.
  Option E: Includes one zoologist and no botanist. Not acceptable.
  
  Therefore, the acceptable selections are B and D.
Action: Answer("B or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
- If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
- F and K cannot both be selected.
- K and M cannot both be selected.
- If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.

Checking each option:
- Option A: It has two botanists and no zoologist. This option does not satisfy the first condition. Discard it.
- Option B: It has one scientist of each type. It satisfies the first condition. It has only one botanist, so it satisfies the second condition. It does not have F and K together, so it satisfies the third condition. It does not have K and M together, so it satisfies the fourth condition. It does not have M without P and R, so it satisfies the fifth condition. This option is acceptable.
- Option C: It has one scientist of each type. It satisfies the first condition. It has two chemists and no botanist. This option does not satisfy the second condition. Discard it.
- Option D: It has one scientist of each type. It satisfies the first condition. It has M and P and R, so it satisfies the fifth condition. It has no botanist. This option does not satisfy the second condition. Discard it.
- Option E: It has one scientist of each type. It satisfies the first condition. It has two chemists and no botanist. This option does not satisfy the second condition. Discard it.

Therefore, the answer is B: G, H, K, L, M. 

Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Option A includes two botanists and no zoologist. So, it is not an acceptable selection.
  Option B includes no botanist. So, it is not an acceptable selection.
  Option C includes two chemists and no botanist. So, it is not an acceptable selection.
  Option D includes one botanist, one chemist, and two zoologists. If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, option D is an acceptable selection.
  Option E includes one botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist. If L is selected, then more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, option E is not an acceptable selection.
  The answer is D: H, K, M, P, R.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we need one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, so we can have at most one botanist and at most one zoologist.
  F and K cannot both be selected, so we can have either F or K, but not both.
  K and M cannot both be selected, so we can have either K or M, but not both.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected, so if M is selected, we must have P and R.
  Let's check each option:
  A: F, G, K, P, Q - violates "If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected."
  B: G, H, K, L, M - satisfies all the conditions.
  C: G, H, K, L, R - violates "The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types."
  D: H, K, M, P, R - satisfies all the conditions.

  The panel must include at least one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  Choice A has two botanists, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Therefore, choice A is not acceptable.
  Choice B has no zoologist, which violates the rule that the panel must include at least one zoologist. Therefore, choice B is not acceptable.
  Choice C has all three types of scientists and only one botanist, which satisfies all the conditions. Therefore, choice C is acceptable.
  Choice D has two chemists and only one botanist, which violates the rule that the panel must include at least one chemist and one botanist. Therefore, choice D is not acceptable.
  Choice E has no chemist, which violates the rule that the panel must include at least one chemist. Therefore, choice E is not acceptable.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 59 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
  B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1924.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1921.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, if Mollie is assigned to 1922, then the assignments will be:
  Mollie - 1922
  Yoshio - 1921
  Onyx - 1923
  Ryan - 1924
  Only Louis is left, and he will be assigned to 1921.
  The answer is A: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1921.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Louis is not assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to 1923, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, if Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921.
  The answer is B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Mollie must be assigned to 1922 if Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  We need to find the condition that forces Mollie to be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923 and Tiffany must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Yoshio must be assigned to 1921.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, if Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  The answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, or Yoshio can be assigned to 1921.
  If Louis is assigned to 1921, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Ryan must be assigned to 1922 and Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to 1922, then Onyx must be assigned to 1921 and Mollie must be assigned to 1921.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922 and Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means Onyx must be assigned to 1922, and Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, which contradicts the condition.
  Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  The only option left is Onyx being assigned to 1921, which means Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  The answer is B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, or Yoshio can be assigned to the remaining years.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1921, then Ryan must be assigned to 1922, which is not possible.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which is not possible.
  If Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Onyx is assigned to 1921.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  We need to find the statement that makes Mollie's assignment definite.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924 or Onyx is assigned to 1921 or Onyx is assigned to 1924 or Tiffany is assigned to 1923 or Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie's assignment is not definite.
  Therefore, the answer is none of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 because that would violate the condition that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1924.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1924, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1924 because that would violate the condition that each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it.
  Therefore, Louis must be assigned to 1921.
  The only remaining year is 1923, which means Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 60 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: If bay 4 is holding produce, then for exactly how many of the six bays is the type of cargo that bay is holding completely determined?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is 3, then the bay holding livestock is 2 and the bay holding grain is 1.
  If the bay holding textiles is 5, then the bay holding livestock is 6 and the bay holding grain is 1.
  In either case, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, and 6 is completely determined by the given conditions.
  Therefore, for exactly 4 of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock is bay 2 and the bay holding grain is bay 1. The bay holding livestock is bay 5 and the bay holding grain is bay 6 if the bay holding textiles is bay 5.
  If the bay holding produce is bay 4, then the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2. The bay holding fuel is bay 5 if the bay holding textiles is bay 3, and the bay holding fuel is bay 3 if the bay holding textiles is bay 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined for four bays: bays 1, 2, 4, and 6.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6 and the bay holding grain must be bay 1.
  In both cases, the bay holding fuel must be bay 2 and the bay holding machinery must be bay 3 or bay 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3 or 5, 4, and 6 is completely determined.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then we know that the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock is bay 2 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is bay 6 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  In either case, the bay holding fuel must be bay 2, and the bay holding machinery must be bay 6.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined for 4 bays: bays 1, 2, 4, and 6.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The remaining bays must hold fuel, machinery, and livestock in some order. 
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The remaining bays must hold fuel, machinery, and livestock in some order.
  In either case, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding is completely determined, as well as the type of cargo in the bay holding grain, livestock, and produce. 
  Therefore, for exactly four of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. Then the bay holding fuel must be bay 6, and the bay holding machinery must be bay 4. This means 3 bays are completely determined (1, 2, 3).
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. Then the bay holding fuel must be bay 2, and the bay holding machinery must be bay 4. This means 4 bays are completely determined (1, 4, 5, 6).
  Therefore, the answer is either A: two or D: five.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then textiles must be in bay 3.
  Therefore, livestock must be in bay 2 and grain must be in bay 1.
  Fuel must be in bay 5.
  Machinery can only be in bay 6.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that each bay is holding is completely determined.
  For all six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is 3, then the bay holding livestock must be 2 and the bay holding grain must be 1, which violates the rule that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Therefore, the bay holding textiles must be 5, and the bay holding livestock must be 4. 
  The bay holding grain must be 2, and the bay holding fuel must be 1.
  Therefore, the only bay left is bay 6, which must be holding machinery.
  So, for exactly 6 bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  The answer is E: six.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then:
  - The bay holding textiles must be either 3 or 5.
  - The bay holding produce must be 4.
  - The bay holding fuel must be either 1 or 2.
  - The bay holding livestock must be either 2 or 1.
  - The bay holding grain must be either 5 or 6.
  - The bay holding machinery must be either 6 or 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined for 4 bays: 1, 2, 4, and 5.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 5 must be holding textiles.
  Therefore, bay 6 must be holding livestock, and bay 3 must be holding fuel.
  Bay 1 and bay 2 must be holding grain and machinery, but it is not clear which one is holding which.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that bay 4 is holding is completely determined, along with the types of cargo that are being held in bays 3, 5, and 6.
  For exactly four of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  The answer is C: four.

Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a possible selection of employees for the team?
Choices:
  A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson
  B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre
  C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre
  D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre
  E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson is not possible because both Paine and Thomson cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre is not possible because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre is possible because Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be, and none of the constraints are violated.
  D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre is possible because Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be, and none of the constraints are violated.
  E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre is not possible because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Therefore, the possible selection of employees for the team is either C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre or D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Starting with option A:
    Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
    Schmidt is on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
    But Paine cannot be on the team, so option A is not possible.
  Moving to option B:
    Ortega is on the team, so neither Myers nor Yoder can be on the team.
    Schmidt is not on the team, so there are no additional constraints.
    This selection satisfies all the constraints.
    Therefore, option B is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  Moving to option C:
    Wong is not on the team, so there are no additional constraints.
    This selection satisfies all the constraints.
    Therefore, option C is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  Moving to option D:
    Wong is not on the team, so there are no additional constraints.
    This selection satisfies all the constraints.
    Therefore, option D is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  Moving to option E:
    Wong is on the team, so both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
    But Myers cannot be on the team, so option E is not possible.
  Therefore, the possible selections of employees for the team are B, C, and D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
- Myers cannot be on the team if Ortega or Paine is on the team.
- Schmidt must be on the team if Paine and Thomson are on the team.
- Wong must be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team.
- The team must have at least four employees.
- We need to find a selection of employees that satisfies all the given conditions.
- Let's check each option:
  - Option A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Schmidt is also on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. This means we cannot have Myers, Paine, and Thomson on the team at the same time. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  - Option B: Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team. However, Myers is not on the team in this option, so Ortega and Paine can be on the team. Schmidt is not on the team, so we don't need to have Paine and Thomson on the team. Zayre is on the team, but we still need at least one more employee. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option C: Schmidt is not on the team, so we don't need to have Paine and Thomson on the team. Wong is not on the team, so we don't need to have Myers and Yoder on the team. Paine, Yoder, and Zayre are on the team, but we still need at least one more employee. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  - Option D: Schmidt is on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. Wong is not on the team, so we don't need to have Myers and Yoder on the team. This option satisfies all the given conditions and has at least four employees. Therefore, this is a possible selection of employees for the team.
  - Option E: Wong is on the team, so both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. Thomson is on the team, but we still need at least two more employees. Therefore, this option is not possible.
- Option D is the only possible selection of employees for the team.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers cannot be on the team with Paine.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  Based on the above conditions, the possible selection of employees for the team is:
  Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers cannot be on the team with Paine.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must all be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must all be on the team together.
  The team must include at least four employees.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that the possible selection of employees for the team is:
  Schmidt, Paine, Thomson, and Yoder or
  Wong, Myers, Yoder, and Zayre.
  Therefore, the answer is either C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre or D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  The possible selections of employees for the team should satisfy all the given conditions.
  Let's evaluate each option:
    - Option A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, option A is not possible.
    - Option B: Ortega and Paine are both on the team, which contradicts the condition that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, option B is not possible.
    - Option C: This option satisfies all the given conditions. Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre can be on the team. Therefore, option C is possible.
    - Option D: This option satisfies all the given conditions. Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre can be on the team. Therefore, option D is possible.
    - Option E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. However, Myers is not on the team, which contradicts the condition. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Thus, options C and D are possible selections of employees for the team.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to select at least four employees from the given eight employees.
  Let's check each option one by one.
  Option A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Paine is in the team, which is not possible. So, option A is not valid.
  Option B: Ortega is in the team, which is fine. But neither Myers nor Wong is in the team, which is not possible. So, option B is not valid.
  Option C: Paine and Yoder are in the team, which is fine. But neither Myers nor Wong is in the team, which is not possible. So, option C is not valid.
  Option D: Schmidt, Thomson, and Yoder are in the team, which is fine. But Myers is not in the team, which is not possible. So, option D is not valid.
  Option E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre are in the team, which is fine. Myers is not in the team, which is also fine. So, option E is valid.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, if Ortega or Paine is on the team, Myers cannot be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, if Paine or Thomson is not on the team, Schmidt cannot be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, if Myers or Yoder is not on the team, Wong cannot be on the team.
  From the given options, option A violates the first condition. Option B violates the third condition. Option C violates the second condition. Option D satisfies all the conditions. Option E violates the first and third conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team must include at least four employees from the given eight employees.
  A: Myers, Paine, Schmidt, and Thomson cannot be the answer because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre cannot be the answer because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  C: Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre can be the answer because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Paine, Schmidt, Yoder, and Zayre can be on the team.
  D: Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre can be the answer because if Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre can be on the team.
  E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre can be the answer because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre can be on the team.
  
Answer: Answer("C"), Answer("D"), and Answer("E") are possible selections of employees for the team.
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The team must include at least four employees.
  We need to check which selection satisfies all the given conditions.
  
Solution:
  Option A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Paine is included in the selection. This option violates the given condition. So, A is not a possible selection.
  Option B: Ortega is included in the selection, so Myers cannot be on the team. Schmidt is not included in the selection, so the condition related to Schmidt is satisfied. This option satisfies all the given conditions. So, B is a possible selection.
  Option C: Paine is included in the selection, so Myers cannot be on the team. Schmidt is not included in the selection, so the condition related to Schmidt is satisfied. But Wong is not included in the selection, so this option violates the given condition. So, C is not a possible selection.
  Option D: Schmidt is included in the selection, so both Paine and Thomson must also be. But neither of them is included in the selection. This option violates the given condition. So, D is not a possible selection.
  Option E: Wong is included in the selection, so both Myers and Yoder must also be. But neither of them is included in the selection. This option violates the given condition. So, E is not a possible selection.
  
Conclusion:
  The only possible selection that satisfies all the given conditions is option B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre.
  Therefore, the answer is B. Answer("B")

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 62 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3 and at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3 and at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, so Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1, so Parra must work in Zone 3 and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  In either case, there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, none of the given choices could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 1 or 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other one works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then the other one works in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then they cannot both work in Zone 2 because there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then they cannot both work in Zone 1 because there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2 or Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Quinn work in Zone 2.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 1, which contradicts the given condition that more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 2, then Tiao works in Zone 1, and Udall works in Zone 3. Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Quinn work in Zone 1, 2, and 3 (in some order), and all the conditions are satisfied.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We also know that if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then either one or two sales representatives work in Zone 1.
  If one sales representative works in Zone 1, then the other sales representative who works in the same sales zone as Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  If two sales representatives work in Zone 1, then the other sales representative who works in the same sales zone as Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 because that would mean that Udall also works in Zone 1, which would contradict the fact that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  The only option that could be true is that Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1.
- From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3. This means that Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall work in Zone 2 or Zone 3. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then at least two of them work in Zone 3. This leaves only one sales representative to work in Zone 2, which is impossible since either Mahr or Kim must work in Zone 2.
- Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2. Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall work in the same sales zone as Parra, which is Zone 1. This means that there are at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1. Since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then at most two of them work in Zone 2. This leaves at least one sales representative to work in Zone 3, which could be Udall or Mahr.
- So, the only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  From the conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, which means there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3 (Parra, Stuckey, and Udall), which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. 
  From the conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Since there are at least 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, the remaining sales representatives Kim, Mahr, and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Kim and Mahr work in Zone 3, and Quinn works in Zone 1.
  The only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 2 or 3 sales representatives in Zone 2.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then either Parra or Udall works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  If there are 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Kim works in Zone 3.
  If there are 4 sales representatives in Zone 1, then Kim works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim could work in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there must be at least 3 sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be at least 4 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. And either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, which would make the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 at least 4 (Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall). This would contradict the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey, and Quinn works in the same sales zone as Parra. Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, and at least one of them must work in Zone 3.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Mahr must work in Zone 3, which would make the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 equal to 3. This would contradict the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Mahr works in Zone 2, then Kim must work in Zone 1, which would make the number of sales representatives in Zone 1 equal to 4. This satisfies the given condition that there are more sales representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives in Zone 3.
- If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall must work in Zone 2.
- Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1.
- Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey works in Zone 2.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then either one or two sales representatives work in Zone 3. If two sales representatives work in Zone 3, then five sales representatives work in Zone 1 and Zone 2. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there are at least two sales representatives in Zone 3.
- If two sales representatives work in Zone 3, then Parra and Tiao work in Zone 1 and the remaining five sales representatives work in Zone 2. This is not possible because Parra and Quinn must work in the same sales zone as each other.
- Therefore, only one sales representative works in Zone 3.
- If only one sales representative works in Zone 3, then either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and the other works in Zone 2.
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2. This means that Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone as each other, which contradicts the given conditions. Therefore, Parra does not work in Zone 1.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2, and Quinn, Udall, and Stuckey work in Zone 1. This satisfies all the given conditions.
- Therefore, Tiao could work in Zone 1.
- The answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 1 should have at least 3 sales representatives.
  Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn also works in Zone 1.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, and Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 1, and at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  The only option that could be true is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We know that more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it is possible that only one sales representative works in Zone 3.
  If only one sales representative works in Zone 3, then it is not possible for Parra to work in Zone 3 because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  If Parra does not work in Zone 3, then Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 1.
  If Parra and Quinn work in Zone 1, then either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. However, if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left to assign to sales zones.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day, so Yuki must test F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day. So, Seamus must test F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must test H on one of the days, so she must test F, G, or J on the other day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G, H, or J on the second day.
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that Seamus cannot test J on the first day because Yuki tests J on the second day.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki cannot test J on the first day. So, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus will test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day. So, Seamus will test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. So, Reynaldo will test either F or G on the second day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because Theresa is already testing H on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus will test either F or G on the first day.
  So, the possible scenarios are:
    1. Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus tests G on the first day, and Reynaldo tests H on the second day.
    2. Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus tests F on the first day, and Reynaldo tests H on the second day.
    3. Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus tests G on the first day, and Yuki tests F on the second day.
    4. Theresa tests J on the first day, Seamus tests F on the first day, and Yuki tests G on the second day.
  Therefore, A, B, and D are not true. C and E could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test J on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test F on the first day.
  This means that Seamus cannot test F on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test G on the first day.
  This means that Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test H on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki must test F on the second day.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests G on the first day.
  Seamus tests H on the first day.
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Yuki tests F on the first day.
  On the second day, Seamus must test J.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
  Therefore, Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
  The only possible option is that Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  Therefore, A is true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo cannot test J on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Therefore, Yuki must test F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus will test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  If Seamus tests J on the second day, then Yuki must test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus will test either F, G, or H on the second day.
  If Seamus tests H on the second day, then Yuki must test G on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus will test either F or G on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo will test G on the second day.
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa will test either F or G on the first day.
  If Theresa tests F on the first day, then Seamus will test H on the first day, which contradicts the condition.
  Therefore, Theresa tests G on the first day.
  If Seamus tests F on the second day, then Yuki must test H on the first day, which contradicts the condition.
  Therefore, Seamus tests G on the second day.
  The only option that could be true is E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
  Yuki must test a different bicycle on the first day and Seamus must test the same bicycle on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Reynaldo must test F on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because Theresa is testing J.
  Therefore, Seamus must test F or G on the first day.
  If Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo must test G on the second day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Seamus tests G on the first day.
  Reynaldo tests F on the first day and G on the second day.
  Yuki tests H on the first day and J on the second day.
  Theresa tests J on the first day and G on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test J on the second day, and Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day. 
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, but she is testing J on the first day. Therefore, Reynaldo or Seamus must be the tester for H on the first day. 
  If Reynaldo tests H on the first day, then Seamus must test G on the first day, but that means Reynaldo will have to test F on the second day, which is not possible because Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Therefore, Seamus must test H on the first day. 
  Yuki tests J on the second day, and Seamus tests the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is not H. 
  Theresa cannot be the tester for G because she is testing J on the first day. Therefore, the only option left is that Theresa is the tester for F on the second day.
  The only option that satisfies all the conditions is Seamus tests H on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo can test G or H on the second day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is not J.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus cannot test J on the second day.
  The only option that satisfies all the conditions is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G, H, or J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so Seamus must test either F, G, or J on the first day.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day.
  If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test either F or G on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G or J on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests G on the second day is possible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G, H, or J.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test either F, G, or H.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which means Seamus cannot test F.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test F, G, or J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the first day.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since two reports are given each day, we know that exactly two of these six students must give reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  We can use the conditions given to eliminate some possibilities and narrow down the answer choices.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday and Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Tuesday.
  Therefore, George must give a report with either Olivia or Robert on Monday morning, and Helen must give a report with either Olivia or Robert on Wednesday morning.
  This leaves Irving, Nina, and either Olivia or Robert to give reports on Monday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so it must be Irving and Nina who give reports on Monday afternoon and Wednesday afternoon.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports.
  We need to determine which students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively.
  We can use the conditions given to eliminate some options and determine the correct answer.
  
Elimination:
  Option A: If George gives a report on Tuesday, then neither Helen nor Nina can give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option B: If Irving gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Robert must give reports on Tuesday, but George cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option C: If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but George cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  Option D: If Irving gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Robert must give reports on Tuesday, but George cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Final Thought:
  The only option left is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
  If Robert, George, and Helen give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then all the conditions are satisfied.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports.
  Tuesday is the only day George can give a report, so he must give his report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Let's consider the case where Nina does not give a report.
  Then, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  There are only three students left who can give reports: Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, they must give their reports in the morning.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, Helen, and Olivia.
  The answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively.
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the only students left to give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Let's consider each option:
  A: If Helen, George, and Nina give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give his report in the morning, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If Irving, Robert, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George cannot give his report in the morning, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If Nina, Helen, and Olivia give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George must give his report in the afternoon, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If Olivia, Robert, and Irving give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George must give his report in the afternoon, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, then on Tuesday, George gives his report in the morning, which satisfies the given condition. Therefore, E is possible.
  Thus, the answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give oral reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  From the given conditions, George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Monday or Tuesday, then on the next day (Tuesday or Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day.
  Therefore, the possible morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, are:
  - If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then on the next day (Tuesday or Wednesday), Helen and Irving must both give reports. Thus, Helen and Irving cannot give reports on Monday. The remaining students who have not given reports yet are George, Nina, and Robert. Among them, only George can give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Nina, George, and Robert. This eliminates choices A, B, and E.
  - If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then there is no requirement for Helen and Irving to give reports on the next day. The remaining students who have not given reports yet are George, Helen, and Olivia. Among them, only George cannot give a report in the morning. Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, Olivia, and Irving. This eliminates choice C.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which three students can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We can eliminate choices A and C because they both include Nina, who may or may not give a report.
  We can eliminate choice D because it includes Olivia and Robert, who cannot give an afternoon report.
  We are left with choice B and E.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, which means that Robert and George must give reports on Wednesday. This satisfies choice E.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We are given that exactly six students will give oral reports over three days.
  We are also given that Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  We are also given that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left who can give reports: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We need to find a combination of three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
  We know that George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give morning reports.
  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But since we know that George must give his report on Tuesday, Nina cannot give her report on Monday.
  Therefore, Nina must give her report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives her report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  This means that Olivia and Robert must give morning reports on Monday and Wednesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Olivia, Helen, and Robert.
  The answer is D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Therefore, George gives a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, they both give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. But George already gives a report on Tuesday, so Nina's report must be on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  Since each student gives one report, the remaining reports are given by Helen, Irving, and Robert.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We are given that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  We are also given that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We are given that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We are given that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  We are given that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We are asked to determine the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we know that they cannot be part of the morning reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be part of the morning reports on Monday or Wednesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give the morning reports.
  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day. If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on Thursday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then she cannot be part of the morning reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then she must be part of the morning reports on Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina. (Choice A)
  The other choices do not satisfy the given conditions.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we can determine the placement of all the books.
  Therefore, the answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can eliminate choices A, B, and E since they don't mention I's placement.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can eliminate choice D since it mentions M being placed with H.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so we can eliminate choice C since it mentions F being placed with L.
  The only condition left is O being placed on a higher shelf than L. If we know where O is placed, we can determine which shelf L is on, and then we can determine which shelf the remaining books are on based on the other conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O and L are placed on different shelves from each other. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we can determine the shelves for F, K, L, and O based on the given conditions.
  If we know that K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the shelves for I, F, L, and O based on the given conditions.
  If we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the shelves for I, K, and O based on the given conditions.
  If we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the shelves for I, F, K, L, and O based on the given conditions.
  If we know that H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the shelves for I, F, K, L, and M based on the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined which shelf each of the books is placed on.
  If any of the following is true, it will not fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other. (We already know that I and F are placed on different shelves, and F is placed on the same shelf as M, so this does not fully determine the placement of the books.)
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other. (We already know that K is placed on the top shelf and G is placed on the bottom shelf, so this does not fully determine the placement of the books.)
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. (We already know that F is placed on the middle shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf, so this does not fully determine the placement of the books.)
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other. (We already know that M is placed on the middle shelf and H is placed on the bottom shelf, so this does not fully determine the placement of the books.)
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other. (We already know that H is placed on the bottom shelf and O is placed on the top shelf, so this does not fully determine the placement of the books.)
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M. 
  Therefore, F and M must be on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the top shelf, which is already occupied by K.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf, but we already know that F and M are on the middle shelf.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the middle shelf, which is already occupied by F and M.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then that shelf must be the top shelf, which is already occupied by K and O.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start by placing I on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F and M are placed on the same shelf, so we can place F and M on the same shelf as I.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so G and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, if M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  The answer is D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M are placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is placed on the top shelf and L is placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, H, G, and I are placed on the bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that H and G must be placed on the bottom shelf, and L must be placed on the top shelf. This fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can use that as a reference point.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they must be either both on the top shelf, both on the middle shelf, or both on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then we know that F must be on the same shelf as well. From there, we can determine the placement of K, O, G, H, and L.
  None of the other options provide enough information to fully determine the placement of the books.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf and F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G, H, and I must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined the placement of all the books based on the given conditions.
  Therefore, the statement that fully determines which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other, then we know that F is placed on the same shelf as M and H. This would mean that F, M, and H are all on the same shelf, which is impossible because at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other, we do not know where the other books are placed.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other, we do not know where the other books are placed.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other, we do not know where the other books are placed.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other, we know that F must be on the top shelf, M must be on the middle shelf, and I must be on the bottom shelf. This is because we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, and F cannot be on the bottom shelf because it is on the same shelf as M. We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the middle or top shelf. O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.

  Theresa tests G on the second day.
  Theresa must test H on one of the days.
  Therefore, Theresa tests H on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki tests F on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so Seamus tests J on the second day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so Reynaldo tests H on the first day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests J on the second day.
  The only remaining bicycle is G, which Seamus tests on the first day.
  Therefore, if Theresa tests G on the second day, then Theresa tests H on the first day.
  The answer is C: Theresa tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then on the first day, G must be tested by either Reynaldo, Seamus, or Yuki.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either H or J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test either F, H, or J on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, so he must test either F or J on the first day.
  Theresa must test H on one of the two days.
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus cannot test G on the second day, so Seamus must test J on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo tests H on the first day.

If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the second day.
If Theresa tests H on the first day, then Yuki cannot test H on the second day.
Therefore, Reynaldo tests J on the first day.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests G on the second day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day, which is not J.
  Therefore, Seamus must test either F, H, or G on the first day.
  If Seamus tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo must test G, and Yuki must test H on the first day.
  But this would mean that Theresa tests J on the first day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test F on the first day.
  If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Reynaldo must test either F or J, and Yuki must test G on the first day.
  But this would mean that Theresa tests J on the first day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test G on the first day, which means Yuki must test H on the first day.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Theresa tests G on the second day.
  Therefore, Seamus tests H on the second day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki tests F on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus tests J on the first day.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, but we don't know which order they are in. Then, the last four articles must be G, J, H, and Y, but we don't know which order they are in either. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If H is sixth, then the first five articles must be Q, R, S, G, and J, but we don't know which order they are in. Then, the last two articles must be H and Y, but we don't know which order they are in either. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and R in that order. Then, the fourth article must be either G or J, but we don't know which one. Then, the fifth article must be either G or J, whichever one was not chosen for the fourth article. Then, the sixth article must be H, and the last article must be Y. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and R in that order. Then, the fourth article must be either G or J, whichever one was not chosen for the third article. Then, the fifth article must be either G or J, whichever one was not chosen for the fourth article. Then, the sixth article must be H, and the last article must be Y. Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G in that order. Then, the fifth article must be J, and we don't know which articles are sixth and seventh. Therefore, the order is not fully determined.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We can start by using the given conditions to create a partial order.
  J < G < R
  S < Q < H
  S < Y
  We can use the partial order to eliminate choices that are not possible.
  If H is fourth, then Q and S must be second and third in some order, which contradicts the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, H cannot be fourth.
  If H is sixth, then Q and S must be fourth and fifth in some order. But this still leaves G, J, and R to be edited consecutively, which is not possible. Therefore, H cannot be sixth.
  If R is fourth, then G and J must be first and second in some order, which leaves Q and S to be edited consecutively, which is not possible. Therefore, R cannot be fourth.
  If R is seventh, then G and J must be fifth and sixth in some order, which leaves Q and S to be edited consecutively, which is not possible. Therefore, R cannot be seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first or second, which contradicts the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, Y cannot be fifth.
  This leaves us with no possible choices, which means that the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined by any of the given conditions.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Let's start with the given conditions:
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  
  We know that there are 3 finance articles, 3 nutrition articles, and 1 wildlife article.
  We also know that S must be earlier than Y, so we can place S and Y in the order S _ Y.
  Since Q must be third if S is earlier than Q, we can place Q in the third position: S _ Q _ Y.
  We also know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, we can place these articles in the order J _ G _ R.
  Now, we have the order J _ G _ R _ S _ Q _ Y, which satisfies all the given conditions.
  Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if Y is fifth.
  The answer is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is earlier than Q, then Q must be third.
  There are three finance, three nutrition, and one wildlife article.
  If H is fourth, then G and J must be first and second, respectively.
  If H is sixth, then G and J must be fifth and fourth, respectively.
  If R is fourth, then G and J must be sixth and seventh, respectively.
  If R is seventh, then G and J must be fourth and fifth, respectively.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first and Q must be third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third and R must be sixth or seventh.
  If Q is third, then S must be second and R must be sixth or seventh.
  If R is sixth, then G and J must be fourth and fifth, respectively.
  If R is seventh, then G and J must be fifth and fourth, respectively.
  If G and J are fourth and fifth, respectively, then H must be first and the nutrition articles must be sixth and seventh.
  If G and J are fifth and fourth, respectively, then H must be seventh and the nutrition articles must be first and second.
  Therefore, the only statement that fully determines the order of the articles is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The order in which the articles are edited is subject to some conditions.
  We need to check each option and see which one will determine the order.
  If H is fourth, we don't know anything about the first three articles, so we can't determine the order.
  If H is sixth, we still don't know anything about the first three articles, so we can't determine the order.
  If R is fourth, we know that G must be first, J must be second, and H must be third. Then, we can't have R as fifth because it would be consecutive with G. Therefore, we must have Q as fifth, S as sixth, and Y as seventh. So, the order is determined.
  If R is seventh, we don't know anything about the order of the first six articles, so we can't determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, we know that S must be first, then Q must be second, then we must have either R or G as third, then J as fourth, then H as sixth, and finally Y as seventh. So, the order is determined.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - If R is seventh, then G must be earlier than R, which means G is sixth or earlier. This means that H cannot be sixth, so H cannot be seventh either. Therefore, R cannot be seventh. Eliminate (D).
  - If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S is fourth or earlier. This means that Q cannot be third, so S cannot be earlier than Q. Eliminate (E).
  - If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition group, and the next three must be from the finance group. However, we still don't know the order within each group, so this is not enough to fully determine the order. Eliminate (A).
  - If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be from the nutrition group, and the next three must be from the finance group. In addition, we know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. The only remaining article from the finance group is H, so we know that the order within the finance group must be JGH. Therefore, the order of the articles is fully determined. The answer is (B).
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can start by placing the articles that have fixed positions.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  We can represent this as J-G-R.
  S must be earlier than Y. We can represent this as S-?-?-?-Y.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. We can represent this as Q-?-S-?-?-Y.
  We know that there are three articles on finance and three articles on nutrition. Therefore, the only possible order is QRS and GHJ.
  If H is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles is QRS. However, we cannot determine the order of the finance articles. We cannot determine the order of Y either. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the nutrition articles is QRS. The order of the finance articles is GHJ. Y must be last. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then we know that G must be second and J must be first. We cannot determine the order of the nutrition articles. We cannot determine the order of Y either. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then we know that G must be fifth and J must be sixth. We cannot determine the order of the nutrition articles. We cannot determine the order of Y either. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then we know that S must be first and Q must be third. We cannot determine the order of the finance articles. We cannot determine the order of R. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is not fully determined if Y is fifth.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We know that S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be fifth or later.
  We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. So, J must be first or second, and R must be sixth or seventh.
  If R is seventh, then G must be sixth, and J must be fifth. This means that H, Q, and S must be second, third, and fourth, but this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Q if Q is third. So, R cannot be seventh.
  If R is sixth, then G must be fifth, and J must be first or second. If J is first, then H, Q, and S must be third, fourth, and seventh, respectively. This means that Y must be sixth, which violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, J cannot be first, and J must be second. This means that H, Q, and S must be first, third, and fourth, respectively. Since S cannot be fifth or later, S must be third. This means that Q must be fourth, and Y must be seventh. Therefore, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if R is sixth.
  The answer is D: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to find a statement that gives us enough information to determine the order of the articles.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If H is fourth, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles.
  B: If H is sixth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, R, and S (in some order), and the last article must be Y. However, we don't know the order of G, H, and J, so there are multiple possible orders.
  C: If R is fourth, we know that the first three articles must be Q, S, and either G or J (since J must be earlier than G). We also know that the last article must be Y. The only remaining articles are H and R, which must be fifth and sixth (in some order). Therefore, the order is fully determined.
  D: If R is seventh, we don't know anything about the order of the other articles.
  E: If Y is fifth, we know that the fourth article must be either G or J (since J must be earlier than G), and the last two articles must be H and R (in some order). However, we don't know the order of the first three articles, so there are multiple possible orders.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that:
  - Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance.
  - Three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition.
  - The remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  - S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  - S must be earlier than Y.
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  - We need to find the statement that fully determines the order of the articles.
  If H is fourth, we don't know anything about the order of the articles before H or after H.
  If H is sixth, we still don't know anything about the order of the articles before H or after H.
  If R is fourth, we can determine the order of the articles as follows:
    - The first article must be S (because S must be earlier than Q).
    - The second article must be Q (because it's the only nutrition article left).
    - The third article must be H (because it's the only finance article left).
    - The fourth article must be R (because it's the only nutrition article left).
    - The fifth article must be G (because G must be earlier than R).
    - The sixth article must be J (because J must be earlier than G).
    - The seventh article must be Y (because it's the only article left).
  If R is seventh, we don't know anything about the order of the articles before R.
  If Y is fifth, we don't know anything about the order of the articles before Y.
  Therefore, the answer is C: R is fourth.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then only one book can be placed with it.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so G cannot be placed with I.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, if G is placed on the top shelf, then H and I must be placed on the middle shelf.
  The answer is A: H, I.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O are placed on the bottom and middle shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so F, H, K, L, M, and O are placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K is on the middle shelf and F is on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O is on the top shelf and L is on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I and L.
  The answer is B: I, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf must have at least three books, and the middle shelf must have at least two books.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so the middle shelf must have at least one more book.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they must both be on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, L.
  The answer is B: I, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be placed on the top or bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be placed on the middle shelf if F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be placed on the top shelf if O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then they must be placed on the top or bottom shelf.
  Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, F and M cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Since G is placed on the top shelf, H, I, K, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  The only choice that includes H and I and does not include K or L is A: H, I.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the top or bottom shelf.
  We also know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  If O is placed on a higher shelf than L, and G is on the top shelf, then there must be at least three books on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible combination for the middle shelf is I and L.
  The answer is B: I, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, and I must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so F and H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L must be placed on the middle or bottom shelf.

Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least four books.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they must be on the same shelf.
  If K is placed on a higher shelf than F, then K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible list of books placed on the middle shelf is H, I, and L.
  The answer is C: H, I, L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then there must be at least two books on the middle shelf and at least three books on the bottom shelf.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned after the mirror and the vase.
  We also know that the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. However, this contradicts the condition that the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. This means that the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This condition is consistent with the condition that the mirror must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the table is auctioned on June 5th, and the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The only choice that could be true is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on a date later than both the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The only option that could be true is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the lamp cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is already auctioned on June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica can be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp can be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica can be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the lamp can be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the table is not auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the sundial cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the table because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, if the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the following could be true:
  The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which contradicts the condition that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This satisfies all the given conditions, so it could be true.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. This satisfies all the given conditions, so it could be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on earlier dates than the table.
  From the given conditions, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and we don't know the exact dates of the auctions, so we cannot determine the order of the sundial and the table.
  The order of the mirror and the vase is also not determined.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  The answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the harmonica and the vase are both auctioned on dates that are earlier than the date on which the table is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. So, it could be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  The harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 6th because it would be auctioned on a later date than the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd because it would be auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase could be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd in any order, and the mirror, sundial, and vase could be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th in any order.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, then the harmonica and the vase could be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd in any order, the sundial could be auctioned on June 3rd, and the mirror and vase could be auctioned on the remaining two days in any order.
  Therefore, the following could be true:
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned earlier than the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase, then the harmonica must be auctioned before the table.
  Therefore, the harmonica, the lamp, and the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd, but not necessarily in that order.
  If the table is auctioned later than the mirror and the vase, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  Choice A is impossible because the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st.
  Choice B is impossible because the table must be auctioned after the lamp.
  Choice C is possible because the sundial can be auctioned on June 1st and the table can be auctioned on June 2nd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Choice D is impossible because the vase must be auctioned after the mirror.
  Choice E is impossible because the sundial must be auctioned before the lamp.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We are given that the table is auctioned on a later date than the dates of the mirror and the vase. 
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than either the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a later date than the vase and the mirror, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, but we don't know which is which.
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  We know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. 
  We can create a table to organize the information:
  
| Day | Item | 
| --- | --- |
| June 1st | Vase or Mirror |
| June 2nd | Vase or Mirror |
| June 3rd-6th | Sundial |
| ? | Table |
| ? | Lamp |
| ? | Harmonica |

  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. 
    - We know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
    - We don't know the order of the table and the lamp, so this could be true.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
    - We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
    - We know that the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd, but we don't know which is which. Therefore, this could be true.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
    - We don't know the order of the sundial and the lamp, so this could be true.
    
  Therefore, the possible true statements are B, D, and E.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible because the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible because the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, which is possible.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, which is possible.
  Therefore, either the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase or the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, and the table is auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  The only option that could be true is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. However, the question states that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. However, the question states that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the vase is auctioned. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, but this is not possible because the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd and June 4th, but this is not possible because the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th and June 5th, but this is not possible because the table must be auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th. Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We must evaluate each statement to determine if it is true or not.
  (A) There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
      We can have a multicolored rug with forest and another color that is not turquoise.
      This statement is not true.
  (B) There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
      Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow. 
      Therefore, if we use turquoise, it must be a solid color.
      This statement is true.
  (C) Peach is used in one of the rugs.
      According to the rules, olive must be used with peach. 
      Therefore, if we use olive, we must use peach.
      This statement is true.
  (D) Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
      According to statement (B), if we use turquoise, it must be a solid color.
      This statement is not true.
  (E) Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
      There are no rules that prevent us from using yellow.
      This statement is true.
  
Answer: Answer("B") and Answer("C") and Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  To determine which one of the following must be true, we can check each option against the given rules.
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
    - There are no rules that forbid the use of forest in multicolored rugs.
    - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, but this does not apply to solid colored rugs.
    - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
    - Turquoise and forest are not used together in a rug, but this does not apply to multicolored rugs.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, but this does not apply to solid colored rugs.
    - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
    - Olive is used in one of the rugs, and peach must also be used in that rug.
    - Therefore, this statement is true.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
    - Turquoise and forest are not used together in a rug, but this does not apply to multicolored rugs.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, but this does not apply to solid colored rugs.
    - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
    - There are no rules that forbid the use of yellow in any of the rugs.
    - Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  Based on the above analysis, the only statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use the process of elimination to solve this problem.
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
     This statement is not true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
     This statement is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is true because peach is used in any rug in which olive is used, and olive is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug and there is no solid rug in which turquoise is used.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not necessarily true because yellow may or may not be used in any of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, they can be used in different rugs.
  If peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, they can be used in different rugs.
  If peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, they can be used in different rugs.
  If white is used in a rug, two other colors are also used, which means a multicolored rug.
  If olive is used in a rug, peach is also used in the same rug.
  If forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, they can be used in the same rug.
  If there are three rugs, and each color is used in only one rug, then there are two multicolored rugs and one solid color rug.
  Therefore, the following must be true:
    - C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  To determine which statement must be true, we can go through each one and eliminate the false statements.
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used. - This statement is not necessarily true. There could be a multicolored rug that uses forest and other colors.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. - This statement is not necessarily true. There could be a multicolored rug that uses turquoise and other colors.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs. - This statement is true because the rule states that if olive is used, peach must also be used. Since olive is one of the available colors, peach must be used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs. - This statement is not necessarily true. Turquoise cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow, but it could be used with olive or white. Therefore, turquoise may or may not be used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs. - This statement is not necessarily true. Yellow could be used in a rug, but it is not a requirement for any of the rules. Therefore, yellow may or may not be used in one of the rugs.
  The only statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use process of elimination to solve this problem.
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
     This statement is not true because it is possible to have a multicolored rug with forest.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
     This statement is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is true because peach is used in a rug where olive is used.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug and it cannot be used with peach.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not necessarily true because yellow may or may not be used in a rug.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to analyze each answer choice to see which one must be true.
  A: It is possible that forest is used in a multicolored rug, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, it cannot be used with forest or peach. Therefore, this statement must be true.
  C: There is no rule that requires peach to be used in one of the rugs, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  D: There is a rule that prohibits turquoise from being used with forest and peach, but there is no rule that requires it to be used in a rug. Therefore, this statement is not necessarily true.
  E: There is no rule that requires yellow to be used in a rug, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  The only statement that must be true is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find a statement that must be true.
  From the given rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  We also know that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  We know that if olive is used, then peach must also be used.
  We know that if white is used, then two other colors must also be used.
  From the given rules, we cannot determine whether there are any multicolored rugs or not.
  We cannot determine whether forest is used or not.
  We cannot determine whether turquoise is used or not.
  However, we know that peach is used in one of the rugs because if olive is used, then peach must also be used.
  We cannot determine whether yellow is used or not.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can use the process of elimination to solve this question.
  Choice A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug with colors other than turquoise.
  Choice B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug due to the rule that peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  Choice C is true because peach must be used in a rug that contains olive.
  Choice D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  Choice E is not necessarily true because yellow may not be used in any of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  To determine which statement must be true, we can go through each statement and eliminate the ones that are not necessarily true.
  A: It is possible that forest is used in a multicolored rug, so this statement is not necessarily true.
  B: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, so it is possible that turquoise is not used in a multicolored rug. This statement could be true.
  C: Peach is used in any rug in which olive is used, and olive is one of the available colors. Therefore, it is possible that peach is used in one of the rugs. This statement could be true.
  D: Turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach, but it is possible that turquoise is used in a solid-colored rug. This statement is not necessarily true.
  E: Yellow is one of the available colors, and it is possible that yellow is used in one of the rugs. This statement could be true.
  Therefore, the statement that must be true is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.

The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then Farley's lecture is not earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which violates one of the constraints. Therefore, A is not true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which means that Holden's lecture must be earlier than the sculptures lecture. However, the sculptures lecture is not one of the lectures that must be given earlier than the lithographs lecture, which means that the sculptures lecture can be given after the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B can be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture, which means that Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture. However, the watercolors lecture is one of the lectures that must be given earlier than the lithographs lecture, which means that the watercolors lecture must be given before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, C is not true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which means that Farley's lecture must be earlier than Holden's lecture. However, Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, which means that Holden's lecture must be the first lecture. Therefore, D is not true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture, which means that Holden's lecture must be earlier than the watercolors lecture. However, the watercolors lecture is one of the lectures that must be given earlier than the lithographs lecture, which means that the watercolors lecture must be given before the lithographs lecture. Therefore, E is not true.
  The only choice that cannot be true is D.

Response 1:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures, each on a different topic.
  Therefore, there are only four possible orders for the lectures.
  We can eliminate the orders that violate the constraints.
  The remaining order is the valid sequence of lectures.
  The answer is the option that cannot be true in any of the valid sequences of lectures.
  Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture because his lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture because Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture.
  Garcia cannot give the watercolors lecture because the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture because Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.

Thought:
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  There are four art historians and four topics, so each historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This violates the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This means that Holden's lecture must be the first lecture, but the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. This violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This means that Holden's lecture must be the first lecture, which is allowed by the constraints. Therefore, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, which is allowed by the constraints. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture and Garcia's lecture. This means that Holden's lecture must be the first lecture, which is allowed by the constraints. Therefore, E can be true.

Thought: 
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can create a timeline to help visualize the constraints.
  Farley's lecture must be first, then Holden's lecture, then Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  From the constraints, we know that the order of the lectures must be: Farley, Holden, Garcia, Jiang.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and C since they violate the order of the lectures.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Jiang must give the watercolors lecture, which is allowed by the constraints. So, we can eliminate choice B.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture, which violates the constraint that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. So, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.

Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then he must give his lecture after the oil paintings lecture, which contradicts the given constraints. So, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden must give the watercolors lecture and Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture. But, the oil paintings lecture must be given before the lithographs lecture, which contradicts the given constraints. So, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden must give the sculptures lecture and Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture. This is possible and does not violate any constraints. So, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley must give his lecture after the oil paintings lecture, which contradicts the given constraints. So, D cannot be true.

Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  Also, T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. So, T must be mentioned in either chapter 3 or 4.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that U is mentioned in chapter 1, and X is mentioned in chapter 2.
  So, the answer is D: U is mentioned in chapter 1. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and X must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be in chapter 6 or 8.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U and X must be in chapters 4 and 5 or chapters 5 and 6.
  If T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and must be mentioned before W, then T must be in chapters 2, 3, or 4.
  If there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T and W must be in chapters 2 and 5 or chapters 3 and 6.
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then W and X must be in chapters 3 and 5 or chapters 4 and 6.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R must be in chapters 1, 2, 3, or 4.
  From the above constraints, the only possible sequence is:
  Chapter 1: U
  Chapter 2: T
  Chapter 3: R
  Chapter 4: X
  Chapter 5: W
  Chapter 6: S
  Chapter 7: Z
  Therefore, the answer is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so U cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T can only be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 5, which satisfies all the constraints.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T can only be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or earlier.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 2, but it can be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, so it can be mentioned in chapter 1, chapter 3, chapter 5, or chapter 6.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 1, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 6, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 5.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, S could be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, T could be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  Therefore, X could be mentioned in chapter 5.
  The answer is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If S is not mentioned in chapter 6, then S must be mentioned in either chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.

  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, but X cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, but W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4, but T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and T must be mentioned in either chapter 2 or 3.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and must be mentioned before W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Since S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 3, 5, or 6.
  Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 5.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4.
  Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 1, 3, 5, or 6.
  Since R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z are each mentioned exactly once, and we have determined the positions of T, W, S, X, and Z, we can determine the positions of R and U.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 4, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  The only choice that satisfies all of these conditions is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, there will be only one student left for the year 1923. Since only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, if Mollie is assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, there will be only one student left for the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Since Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then there will be two students left for the years 1921 and 1922. Since only one student can be assigned to each of these years, Louis and Yoshio must be assigned to these years. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924. 
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then there will be four students left for the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Since only one student can be assigned to each of these years, Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, and Onyx must be assigned to these years. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, there will be two students left for the years 1921 and 1922. Since only one student can be assigned to each of these years, Louis and Yoshio must be assigned to these years. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923. However, if Ryan is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  The only option that could be true is A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned, then the remaining five students will be assigned to the project.
  From the given conditions, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned, then Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, Ryan, and Onyx will be assigned to the project.
  Louis or Tiffany will be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Onyx could be assigned to 1922.
  The only statement that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only 5 students are available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then only Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, either Louis is not assigned to the project or Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then either Louis is not assigned to the project or Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  The answer is either A: Louis is not assigned to the project or B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only 5 students available for the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan is not assigned to the project, which violates the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project."
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that either Louis or Tiffany will be assigned to 1923, which violates the condition "Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923."
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which violates the condition "If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project."
  Therefore, the only possible option is A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find a possible scenario where Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then we have five students available: Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  From the conditions, we know that only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis could be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Mollie could be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project. Therefore, Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  We have Louis assigned to 1923, Mollie assigned to 1921 or 1922, and Onyx assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx could be assigned to 1922.
  The only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be only five students available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. Therefore, only four years will be left for the remaining four students.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. Therefore, if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only 5 students are available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. This means Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. This means Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Mollie must be assigned to 1922. This means Louis must be assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis is assigned to 1921, Mollie is assigned to 1922, Tiffany is assigned to 1923, Ryan is assigned to 1924, and Onyx is assigned to 1923. This means the answer is E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which statement could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan or Louis, Mollie, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923, which means Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. This means that Ryan must be assigned to the project and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Louis is assigned to the project, then the students assigned to the years are Louis-1921, Mollie-1922, Onyx-1923, and Ryan-1924. If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which means Ryan must be assigned to the project and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Louis is not assigned to the project, then the students assigned to the years are Tiffany-1923, Mollie-1921 or 1922, Onyx-1922 or 1923, and Ryan-1924. This means that D: Onyx is assigned to 1922 could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students who could be assigned to the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then he cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Louis is assigned to the project, then the only possible arrangement is:
  Louis - 1921
  Mollie - 1922
  Tiffany - 1923
  Ryan - 1924
  Onyx - 1923
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Louis is not assigned to the project, then the only possible arrangement is:
  Mollie - 1921
  Yoshio - 1922
  Tiffany - 1923
  Ryan - 1924
  Onyx - 1923
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then it could be true that:
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("BCD")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be five students available for the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there will be four students left. This means that either Tiffany or Louis will be assigned to 1923, which is not possible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project because if Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Ryan must not be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible because if Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, which is not possible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so either 0 or P must be shown first or second.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so either 0 or P must be shown in the afternoon.
  Based on the above rules, the order of the houses could be: 
  [0 or P], [0 or P], K, L, M, N, J. 
  Therefore, the answer is C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: K, _, _, L, M, _, J.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so the first house must be either 0 or P.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so the last house must be either 0 or P.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so the third and fifth houses must be N and either 0 or P, in some order.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: K, P/N, N/P, L, M, P/0, J.
  The only answer choice that follows this order is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first house to be shown.
  From the given options, only option B has L shown after K and before M.
  Therefore, the answer is B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate answer choices A and E.
  In answer choice B, N is shown first, but K cannot be shown in the morning, so answer choice B is incorrect.
  In answer choice C, K is shown second, but K cannot be shown in the morning, so answer choice C is incorrect.
  In answer choice D, K is shown fifth, L is shown fourth, and J is shown seventh, which satisfies all the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  From the rules, we can deduce that J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so it must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the first and second houses must be shown in the morning, and the sixth and seventh houses must be shown in the evening.
  The order of the houses that satisfies the rules is: K, O, L, N, M, P, J.
  The answer is A: K, O, L, N, M, P, J.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or the seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so neither J nor K can be the first or second house shown.
  Therefore, the first and second houses shown must be either L, M, N, 0, or P.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so neither J nor K can be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  Therefore, the third, fourth, and fifth houses shown must be either L, M, N, 0, or P.
  Therefore, the only possible order is 0, P, K, L, N, M, J.
  The answer is C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the afternoon, and L must be shown before M in the afternoon.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so 0 and P must be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, N must be shown in the afternoon.
  The only order that satisfies all of the rules is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, the first and second houses cannot be L, M, N, 0, or P.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon. Therefore, the third, fourth, and fifth houses cannot be J.
  Based on the above rules, we can conclude that the order of the houses is as follows:
  [Morning] - [Afternoon] - [Afternoon] - [Afternoon/Evening] - [Afternoon/Evening] - [Evening] - [Evening]
  The only option that follows this pattern is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so the first and second houses cannot be J or K.
  The only choice that satisfies all the rules is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be either the sixth or the seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be either the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Since K cannot be shown in the morning, K must be either the sixth or the seventh house.
  If K is the sixth house, then L must be the seventh house, which means that M must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  If K is the seventh house, then L must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house, which means that M must be the sixth house.
  If J is the seventh house, then P must be the sixth house, which means that N must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  If J is the sixth house, then P must be the seventh house, which means that N must be either the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  Therefore, the only possible order is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.

  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K cannot be published in the fall with M.
  This leaves us with two options: L and P.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other, so if M is published in the fall, P must be published in the spring. Therefore, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is L and 0.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, K and O must both be published in the fall.
  This means that either L or P can be published in the fall along with M, K, and O.
  However, P cannot be published in the same season as M. Therefore, the only option is to publish L in the fall with M, K, and O.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and O.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then the order of the first three compositions must be either F, H, and L or L, H, and F.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth. Therefore, the first composition must be O.
  P is performed at some time before S, which means P cannot be performed first. Therefore, the second composition must be either F or L.
  If the second composition is F, then the third composition must be H. If the second composition is L, then the third composition must be H as well.
  Therefore, the possible accurate lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, are:
  - O, F, H (because P cannot be performed before F)
  - O, L, H (because P cannot be performed before L)
  The answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We do not know the exact order of the compositions yet.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S.
  If O is performed fifth, then at least one composition is performed after O and before S.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some answer choices.
  If O is performed first, then answer choices C, D, and E are eliminated.
  If L or H is the eighth composition performed, then answer choice B is eliminated.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or D.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S. Since S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed second and third in some order. Therefore, the answer is A: F, H, P.
  If O is performed fifth, then at least one composition is performed after O and before S. Since S is performed fourth, then F and R must be performed first and second in some order. Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions that could be performed before S are O, F, H, L, R, and T.
  From the conditions given, we know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then F and R must be performed consecutively. This means that the compositions that could be performed before S are H, L, and T.
  If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed consecutively. This means that the compositions that could be performed before S are H, L, and T.
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so if O is performed first, then H must be the eighth composition performed. If O is performed fifth, then L must be the eighth composition performed.
  From the conditions given, we know that P is performed at some time before S. This means that P must be either the first, second, or third composition performed.
  If P is performed first, then the compositions that could be performed second and third are H, L, R, and T.
  If P is performed second, then the compositions that could be performed first and third are H, L, R, and T.
  If P is performed third, then the compositions that could be performed first and second are H, L, R, and T.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S, so P must be performed either first, second or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first, second or third.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed first or second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed sixth or seventh.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third. But in answer choices A, B, and E, P is performed before O, which is not possible.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first, second or third. But in answer choice C, R is performed before P, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth. 
  The eighth composition performed is either L or H, so we cannot determine which one will be performed.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if S is performed fourth, then O is performed first.
  At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Since S is performed fourth, then at least one composition is performed after O and before S. 
  P is performed at some time before S, so P is performed second.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. Since S is performed fourth, then T cannot be performed immediately before F. Therefore, T must be performed immediately after R.
  At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Since T is performed immediately after R, then at least two compositions are performed after R and before F. 
  The only choice that satisfies all the conditions is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The order of performance must satisfy the following conditions:
  - T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  - At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  - O is performed either first or fifth.
  - The eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  - P is performed at some time before S.
  - At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
  
  If S is performed fourth, we know that P must be performed before S. Therefore, O must be performed first or fifth. If O is performed first, then P must be performed after O and before S. If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed after S and before O. In either case, we know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. If S is performed fourth, then T cannot be performed immediately before F, so T must be performed immediately after R. This means that at least two compositions are performed after R and before F. We can eliminate choices A and B because they do not satisfy this condition. Choice C is a possible order of performance if O is performed first. Choice D is a possible order of performance if O is performed fifth. Choice E is not possible because T cannot be performed immediately before F. Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  If P is performed first, then the only composition that can be performed second is R.
  If P is performed second, then the only composition that can be performed first is either O or L/H.
  If P is performed third, then the only composition that can be performed first is either O or L/H, and the only composition that can be performed second is R.
  Therefore, the possible accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - If P is performed first, then the list is: P, R, T.
  - If P is performed second, then the list is: O, P, R or L/H, P, R.
  - If P is performed third, then the list is: O, L/H, P, R.
  The answer is either D: O, P, T or E: P, R, T.

Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P must be performed first, second, or third.
  We know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, either F or R must be performed second or third.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, L or H must be performed last.
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if F or R is performed second, then T must be performed third.
  If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth and L or H must be performed eighth.
  If P is performed second, then either O or T must be performed first, and L or H must be performed eighth.
  If P is performed third, then either O or T must be performed first, and L or H must be performed eighth.
  Therefore, the possible combinations are:
  - P, O, F, T, R, S, H, L
  - P, T, O, F, R, S, L, H
  - P, O, T, F, R, S, L, H

Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  We also know that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then P cannot be performed first, because P must be performed before S.
  Therefore, if O is performed first, then P must be performed second or third.
  If O is performed fifth, then P can be performed first, second, or third.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, if O is performed first, then the eighth composition must be either L or H.
  If O is performed fifth, then the eighth composition can be either L or H, but it could also be one of F, R, or T.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, if T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed fifth, and if T is performed immediately after R, then F must be performed fifth.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  Therefore, if F is performed first, then R must be performed fifth, and if R is performed first, then F must be performed fifth.
  If O is performed first, then the only possible compositions that can be performed second and third are P and either L or H.
  If O is performed fifth, then the only possible compositions that can be performed first are either L or H, and the only possible compositions that can be performed second and third are P and either F or R.
  Therefore, the only possible accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is D: O, P, T.

  We know that S is performed fourth.
  We also know that P is performed at some time before S.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second or third.
  If P is performed first, then O must be performed fifth.
  If P is performed second, then O must be performed first.
  If P is performed third, then O must be performed first or fifth.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  Therefore, the eighth composition cannot be P or S.
  If the eighth composition is L, then H must be performed before P.
  If the eighth composition is H, then L must be performed before P.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If T is performed immediately before F, then O must be performed fifth, and P must be performed first or second.
  If T is performed immediately after R, then O must be performed first, and P must be performed second or third.
  We also know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If O is performed first, then F and R must be performed together, and the only possible order is F, R.
  If O is performed fifth, then F and R must be performed together, and the only possible order is R, F.
  If O is performed first, then the only possible order for P and S is P, S.
  If O is performed fifth, then the only possible order for P and S is S, P.
  Therefore, the only possible list of compositions performed first, second, and third if S is performed fourth is O, P, T.

  Bay 4 is adjacent to the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding textiles has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Therefore, livestock cannot be held in bay 5.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Therefore, fuel cannot be held in bay 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Therefore, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, livestock cannot be held in bay 5.
  The remaining choices are machinery and produce.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, produce cannot be held in bay 4.
  The answer is D: produce.
Action: Answer("D")

  We know that there are six bays numbered 1 through 6 and each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  We need to find a cargo type that cannot be held in bay 4.
  Bay 4 is next to bay 3 and bay 5.
  Bay 3 cannot hold produce because produce has a higher number than fuel, which is held in bay 1 or 2.
  Bay 5 cannot hold livestock because livestock has a higher number than textiles, which is held in bay 6.
  Bay 4 cannot hold grain because grain has a higher number than livestock, which is held in a bay with a higher number than 4.
  Bay 4 cannot hold textiles because textiles is next to produce, which is held in a bay with a higher number than 4.
  Bay 4 can hold machinery.
  Therefore, the cargo type that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is D: produce.

  Bay 4 is between Bay 3 and Bay 5.
  Bay 3 cannot hold produce or textiles because they are next to Bay 4.
  Bay 5 cannot hold grain or livestock because they must be in a lower-numbered bay than the bay holding grain or livestock.
  Therefore, Bay 4 cannot hold machinery, which is the only remaining option.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Bay 4 is located in the middle of the dock.
  Textiles is next to Produce, so they must be in bays 3 and 5, but we don't know which one is which.
  Produce has a higher number than Fuel, so Fuel must be in bays 1 or 2.
  Livestock has a higher number than Textiles, so Livestock must be in bays 1 or 2.
  Grain has a higher number than Livestock, so Grain must be in bay 1 if Livestock is in bay 2, or in bay 2 if Livestock is in bay 1.
  Therefore, Machinery cannot be in bay 4 because it is the only option left, and each bay can hold only one type of cargo.
Action: Answer("C")

  Bay 4 is not holding the type of cargo that violates any of the given conditions.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain cannot be in bay 5 or 6.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock cannot be in bay 5 or 6.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so produce cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1, 3, 4, or 6.
  Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 cannot be produce.
Action: Answer("D")

  We know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  We know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  We know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Bay 4 is next to bay 5 and bay 3.
  If bay 4 held grain, then bay 5 would have to hold livestock, which would violate the rule that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  If bay 4 held livestock, then bay 3 would have to hold textiles, which would violate the rule that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  If bay 4 held produce, then bay 5 would have to hold textiles, which would violate the rule that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If bay 4 held fuel, then bay 5 would have to hold textiles, which would violate the rule that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  If bay 4 held textiles, then bay 3 would have to hold livestock, which is allowed by the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is E: textiles.

  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have only the work of two students displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  So, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position on the same wall.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible configurations: 
  1. Optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 1 or 3.
  2. Optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5 or 7.
  In both configurations, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store cannot be next to the optometrist.
  Thus, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair must be a restaurant and the pharmacy.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible locations for the optometrist-shoe store pair: spaces 1 and 2 or spaces 6 and 7.
  If the optometrist is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 2 and the veterinarian must be in space 3 or space 7. This violates the constraint that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 6, the shoe store must be in space 5, and the veterinarian must be in space 4.
  The pharmacy can be in space 1 or space 7, and the two restaurants must be in spaces 2 and 3 or spaces 4 and 5.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7. If the pharmacy is in space 7, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements: optometrist on the left and shoe store on the right or vice versa.
  If the optometrist is on the left and the shoe store is on the right, then the pharmacy must be on the left end and one of the restaurants must be on the right end. 
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the other restaurant cannot be next to the optometrist and the shoe store.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist and the veterinarian must be next to the toy store.
  This means that the toy store must be next to a restaurant, and the other restaurant must be next to the shoe store.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")

  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist cannot be at either end of the row.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant that is not at the end must be separated from the other restaurant by at least two businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist and the veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it must be next to the restaurant that is not at the end.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist and the shoe store must occupy spaces 2 and 3 in some order.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must occupy space 1 or space 7.
  One of the restaurants must be at the other end of the row, so it must occupy space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants cannot occupy space 1 and space 2.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the optometrist occupies space 2, then the pharmacy must occupy space 1 and the veterinarian must occupy space 4.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store cannot occupy space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the veterinarian, in some order.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible locations for the optometrist and shoe store pair: spaces 1 and 2 or spaces 6 and 7.
  If the optometrist and shoe store are in spaces 1 and 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 3 or 7. However, if the pharmacy is in space 3, it cannot be next to the optometrist or veterinarian, which violates one of the constraints. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7, which means one of the restaurants must be in space 1. This satisfies the constraints and leaves spaces 4, 5, and 6 for the remaining businesses.
  The only possible pair of businesses that can be immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store, since the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist must be in either space 2 or space 6.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the shoe store must be in space 3.
  If the optometrist is in space 6, then the shoe store must be in space 5.
  In either case, the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then one of the restaurants must be in space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then one of the restaurants must be in space 1.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the restaurant that is not at the end must be in either space 3 or space 5.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, if the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the veterinarian must be in space 4.
  If the optometrist is in space 6, then the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the veterinarian must be in space 4.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, if the optometrist is in space 2, then the toy store must be in space 5 and the two restaurants must be in spaces 3 and 7.
  If the optometrist is in space 6, then the toy store must be in space 3 and the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 5.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair are a restaurant and the toy store.
  The answer is D: a restaurant and the toy store. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements:
  1. optometrist-shoe store-?-?-?-?-pharmacy
  2. pharmacy-?-?-?-?-optometrist-shoe store
  The pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be at either end of the row.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants cannot be next to the optometrist and the shoe store.
  The only possible arrangement is that the pharmacy is at one end of the row and one of the restaurants is at the other end.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist-shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and the toy store.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the order of the businesses in the row could be:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist], [shoe store], [restaurant], [restaurant], [toy store], [veterinarian]
  or
  [veterinarian], [optometrist], [shoe store], [restaurant], [restaurant], [toy store], [pharmacy]
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be either at space 1 or space 7.
  The restaurant must be at the other end of the row, so it must be either at space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant at the end of the row must be separated from the other restaurant by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is at space 1, the optometrist must be at space 2 and the veterinarian must be at space 7. If the pharmacy is at space 7, the optometrist must be at space 6 and the veterinarian must be at space 1.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be at either space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store must be the pharmacy and the restaurant.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are three possible scenarios:
  1. Optometrist is in space 1 and shoe store is in space 2.
  2. Optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 3.
  3. Optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5.
  
  In scenario 1, the pharmacy can only be in space 3 or space 7. However, if the pharmacy is in space 3, then the optometrist is next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. This means that a restaurant must be in space 1 and the toy store must be in space 2. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  
  In scenario 2, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7. However, if the pharmacy is in space 7, then the two restaurants cannot be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1. This means that a restaurant must be in space 7 and the toy store must be in space 6. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  
  In scenario 3, the pharmacy can only be in space 1 or space 7. However, if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist is next to the veterinarian, which is not allowed. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 7. This means that a restaurant must be in space 1 and the toy store must be in space 2. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and a restaurant in all three scenarios.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 82 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the first and second batches of sugar cookies must have been made on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there are only three batches of oatmeal cookies made each week, and the first and second batches are already made on Monday and Wednesday.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Friday, then we know that the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday because that would mean two batches of sugar cookies are made on the same day. 
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because we know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the question states that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, and we don't know when the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because that would mean the second batch of peanut butter cookies would have to be made on Friday, which is not possible since only one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Friday.
  The answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If only one batch is made on Friday, then there are two batches made on Thursday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on another day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday, because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, because all three kinds of cookies must be made on Friday and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, because then the first batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Tuesday, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Since there are three kinds of cookies, and three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week, there are a total of 9 batches of cookies made each week.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there are 8 batches of cookies left to be made from Tuesday to Friday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so each day, exactly one batch of each kind of cookie is made.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, which means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then one batch of each kind of cookie must have been made from Monday to Thursday. Therefore, the only batch that could be made on Friday is the third batch of oatmeal cookies.
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies could be made on Friday, as explained above. This is a possible scenario.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made before the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches of cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because there must be at least one batch of cookies made on Monday.
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there are only three batches of oatmeal cookies made each week, and the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because there must be two batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  The answer is A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that three batches of each kind of cookie are made from Monday to Thursday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. This means that no batches of peanut butter cookies can be made on Wednesday or Thursday, which contradicts the given conditions. So, A is not true.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, B is true.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, C is true.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, D is not true.
  If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, E is not true.
  Therefore, the possible true statement is B or C.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can determine which batches were made on each day of the week.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so there are either one or two batches made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then there are no batches of sugar cookies made on Thursday or Friday, which is not possible.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which means there are two batches of oatmeal cookies made on Friday, which is not possible.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday. The first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, which means the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. The first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday, which means the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. This satisfies all the conditions and is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can try to deduce which batches were made on which days.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Tuesday or Wednesday.
  Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot have been made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  Since the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, we know that the first batch of either oatmeal or peanut butter cookies must have been made on Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so if the first batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Friday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must also have been made on Friday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot have been made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  That leaves us with only one possibility: the first batch of peanut butter cookies was made on Monday.
  This means that the second batch of oatmeal cookies was made on Monday as well.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot have been made on Monday.
  The only remaining possibility is that the third batch of oatmeal cookies was made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that there are three kinds of cookies and three batches of each kind are made each week.
  Also, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, there are only two possible scenarios for the batches made on Friday: one batch of oatmeal, one batch of peanut butter, and one batch of sugar or three batches of the same kind of cookie.
  If there is one batch of sugar cookies made on Friday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Thursday. This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then there would be no batches of sugar cookies left to make on Wednesday or Friday, which contradicts the given information.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Friday, which contradicts the given information.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies would have to be made on Wednesday, which contradicts the given information.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of sugar cookies would have to be made on Monday, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This means that the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on Monday and the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Wednesday.
  The answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that one batch of one of the three kinds of cookies was made on Friday.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. This cannot be true because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday. This cannot be true because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday. This cannot be true because only one batch was made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. This could be true because it does not conflict with any of the given conditions.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. This cannot be true because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.

Thought:
  Screen 2 shows two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Therefore, the horror film and the mystery cannot be both shown on screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The list of movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, cannot be (B) the sci-fi film, the mystery, because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The answer is B: the sci-fi film, the mystery.

  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Let's check each option to see which one is not possible.
  Option A: The western is not shown on screen 2, so this option is possible.
  Option B: The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so this option is possible.
  Option C: This option is possible because the western can be shown before the horror film on screen 2.
  Option D: This option is possible because the western can be shown before the horror film on screen 2.
  Option E: This option is not possible because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
  D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
  E: The shoe store is next to the veterinarian.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the two restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7.
  The pharmacy must be at either space 1 or space 7 and must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7 and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, a restaurant must be in space 2 or space 6.
  If the restaurant is in space 2, then the optometrist is next to the other restaurant, which violates the constraint that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 6 and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the veterinarian must be in space 7, which means that the pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 and the optometrist must be in space 6, which means that the pharmacy must be in space 7 and must be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")

  If the pharmacy is in space 1 or 7, then the optometrist or veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
  If the optometrist or veterinarian is in space 2 or 6, then the restaurant that is not at the end must be in space 4 or 5.
  If the restaurant that is not at the end is in space 4 or 5, then the other restaurant must be in space 7 or 1.
  If the other restaurant is in space 7 or 1, then the toy store cannot be in space 6 or 2, so it must be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the toy store must be next to a restaurant.
  The answer is C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy cannot be in space 1 or 7 because it must be at one end of the row.

  Also, the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the restaurant cannot be in space 2 or 6.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 1 or 7.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and the veterinarian must be in space 1.
  If the pharmacy is in space 6, then the optometrist must be in space 5 and the veterinarian must be in space 7.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so if the veterinarian is in space 1, then the toy store must be in space 3 or 5.
  If the veterinarian is in space 7, then the toy store must be in space 3 or 5 as well.
  If the restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 4 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  If the restaurant is in space 7, then the veterinarian must be in space 4 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, if the shoe store is in space 4, then the optometrist is next to a restaurant.

  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store.
  The only option left is that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.

Response 4:
Thought:
  The shoe store is in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  If the pharmacy is at one end of the row, it cannot be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be at the other end of the row and next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  If the pharmacy is at the other end of the row and next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or space 6.
  If the veterinarian is in space 2, the optometrist must be in space 1 and the pharmacy must be in space 7.
  If the veterinarian is in space 6, the optometrist must be in space 7 and the pharmacy must be in space 1.
  In either case, a restaurant must be in space 3 or space 5.
  Therefore, a restaurant is next to the shoe store.
  The shoe store is not next to the toy store.

  Therefore, the restaurants must be in spaces 1 and 7, and the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist must be in space 2 and the veterinarian in space 3.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist must be in space 6 and the veterinarian in space 5.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in either space 2 or 6.
  If the toy store is in space 2, then the optometrist is next to a restaurant.
  If the toy store is in space 6, then the veterinarian is next to a restaurant.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.

  If the shoe store is in space 4, then we can place the pharmacy and one of the restaurants at spaces 1 and 7 (in either order).
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the other restaurant cannot be in space 2 or 6.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6, and the optometrist must be in space 3 or 5.
  If the optometrist is in space 3, then the restaurant must be in space 7, and the toy store must be in space 6, which violates the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the optometrist is in space 5, and the restaurant is in space 1.
  This means that the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian, so B is true.
  The shoe store is not next to the toy store or the veterinarian, so D and E are false.
  The optometrist is not next to a restaurant, so A is false.
  The only statement that must be true is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If the shoe store is in space 4, it means that spaces 3 and 5 are occupied by other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. If the pharmacy is at one end, it means that the restaurant must be at the other end. Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 1 or 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. If the restaurant is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2, and the other restaurant must be in space 4 or 5. However, if the other restaurant is in space 5, then the pharmacy cannot be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 7, and the other restaurant must be in space 4.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the restaurant is in space 7, then the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6 and the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 5 or 7.

  Therefore, the colors of those two rugs cannot include any two colors that cannot be used together in a rug.
  The colors that cannot be used together in a rug are forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow.
  Therefore, the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be forest and peach (because forest is not used in a single-colored rug), peach and turquoise (because they cannot be used together), or peach and yellow (because they cannot be used together).
  The answer is A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")

  If yellow is used in one of the solid rugs, then peach cannot be used in the same rug. Therefore, yellow cannot be used with peach.
  If forest is used in one of the solid rugs, then yellow cannot be used in the same rug. Therefore, forest cannot be used with yellow.
  If peach is used in one of the solid rugs, then turquoise cannot be used in the same rug. Therefore, peach cannot be used with turquoise.
  If yellow is used in one of the solid rugs, then turquoise cannot be used in the same rug. Therefore, yellow cannot be used with turquoise.
  The colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug are forest and peach, forest and yellow, peach and turquoise, and yellow and turquoise.

  Using these rules, we can eliminate the answer choices that violate these rules.
  The answer is B: forest and yellow.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of those rugs must have only one color.
  If a solid rug contains forest, then the other solid rug cannot contain peach because peach is used with olive, and olive is not used with forest.
  If a solid rug contains yellow, then the other solid rug cannot contain peach because peach and yellow are not used together.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach or peach and yellow.
  The answer is A: forest and peach.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Verma could be the project leader if the constraints are satisfied.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member if Verma is the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, Taylor must be a project member if Smith is a project member and Verma is the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member if Verma is the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, then only Wells, Smith, Taylor, and Xue can be project members.
  If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then either Wells or Taylor must be selected.
  If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Smith must be selected.
  Therefore, either Smith or Xue must be selected if Verma is the project leader.
  The only choice that satisfies this condition is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, the possible combinations of project members are:
  1. Smith, Taylor, Verma
  2. Smith, Taylor, Wells
  3. Smith, Wells, Quinn
  4. Smith, Wells, Xue
  If Verma is the project leader, then Verma must be a project member.
  Therefore, the only possible combination is 1.
  The answer is A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  If Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member and Taylor must also be a project member.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be the project leader.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We want to find a scenario where Verma can be the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. So, Wells cannot be selected.
  Exactly one of the project members will be the project leader. So, three workers will be selected, and one of them will be the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be the project leader and either Quinn or Ruiz can be the project member.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  If Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member, and neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members. Also, if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  Let's check each choice:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member if leading the project.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be the project leader. Quinn, Smith, and Verma can be the project members.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because if Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member, and if Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because if Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because if Verma is the project leader, then Wells cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, the only choice that works is B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  For Verma to be the project leader, we need to ensure that at least one of Quinn or Ruiz is a project member.
  Option A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we cannot select Quinn as the project leader. Incorrect.
  Option B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then we cannot select Ruiz as the project leader. Incorrect.
  Option C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then we can select Smith as the project leader, and Verma and Wells can be the other two members. Incorrect.
  Option D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then we can select Xue as the project leader, and Verma and Wells can be the other two members. Incorrect.
  Option E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then we can select Verma as the project leader, and Smith and Xue can be the other two members. Correct.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Verma could be the project leader only if she is selected as a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is a project member, then Wells cannot be.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is a project member, then Smith must also be.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Therefore, if Verma is a project member, then she cannot be the project leader.
  The answer is None of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  To satisfy the above conditions, the only possible combination of project members and the leader is:
    - Verma (leader), Smith, and Taylor
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  From the answer choices, the only combination that includes both Smith and Taylor is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Verma could be the project leader if the other two project members do not include Ruiz and/or Taylor and Wells is not selected.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, Smith and Taylor must be selected together.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, Wells cannot be selected if Verma is to be the project leader.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must be the project leader. Therefore, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected unless they are the project leader.
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the only possible combination of project members that would allow Verma to be the project leader is Smith, Verma, and Xue.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells must not be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith must be a project member and Taylor must also be a project member.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because Quinn must be a project member if he is not the project leader.
  B: If neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because Ruiz must be a project member if he is not the project leader.
  C: If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because Smith must be a project member and Taylor must also be a project member.
  D: If neither Smith nor Xue is selected, then Verma cannot be the project leader because Smith must be a project member.
  E: If neither Taylor nor Wells is selected, then Verma can be the project leader because Smith and Taylor can be project members, and either Quinn or Ruiz can be the third project member.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  To find the answer, we need to determine who can perform the third solo based on the given restrictions.
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so they must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist must perform a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The violinist can perform the first or second solo.
  Based on these restrictions, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the saxophonist because they must perform a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Therefore, the answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  There are six members, so each member must perform exactly one solo.
  The third solo is performed after the first two solos, so we can use the given restrictions to eliminate the choices that cannot perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo if the percussionist performs the first solo and the trumpeter performs the second solo. In this case, the third solo must be performed by either the keyboard player or the violinist.
  Therefore, the answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to determine who can perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Therefore, the saxophonist must perform either the second or the third solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  Therefore, the keyboard player must perform either the first or the second solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform either the first or the second solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the guitarist must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  The remaining two soloists are the trumpeter and the violinist.
  From the above analysis, we can see that the violinist cannot perform the third solo because the saxophonist and the keyboard player must perform before the guitarist, who does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the answer is E: violinist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  Therefore, the third solo must be performed by the saxophonist or the violinist.
  So, none of the above cannot perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  Therefore, the only member who could perform the third solo is the percussionist. 
  This means that all the other members cannot perform the third solo.
  Therefore, the answer is D: trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  We need to determine who can perform the third solo.
  If the percussionist performs before the keyboard player, then the violinist must perform before the percussionist so that the keyboard player can perform after the violinist.
  The saxophonist performs after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist performs after the percussionist if the percussionist performs before the trumpeter.
  If the saxophonist performs after the percussionist, then the saxophonist performs after the violinist and the keyboard player.
  The only remaining soloists are the trumpeter and the guitarist.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the trumpeter must perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the third solo must be performed by the violinist.
  The answer is E: violinist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  Therefore, the only remaining member who can perform the third solo is the trumpeter.
  The answer is D: trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Therefore, the third solo cannot be performed by the saxophonist because the saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must perform the first solo and the trumpeter must perform the second solo. Then, the violinist must perform the fourth solo, the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo, and the guitarist must perform the sixth solo. This satisfies all the given restrictions.
  Therefore, all members can perform the third solo except for the percussionist.
  The answer is D: trumpeter.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist performs either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must perform the first or second solo. But the keyboard player must perform a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Thought:
  The fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, Lugo's audition must be the fifth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition must be the first or the second audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be the second or the third audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition must be the fourth or the fifth audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Kammer's audition or Trillo's audition.
  If the fourth audition is Kammer's audition, then Trillo's audition must be the sixth audition.
  If the fourth audition is Trillo's audition, then Kammer's audition must be the first audition.
  Therefore, the only possible sixth audition is Trillo's audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded and Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Also, we know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Therefore, Waite's audition must be the first audition, and the two recorded auditions must be the second and third auditions.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Trillo's audition must be the fourth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the fifth audition.
  Therefore, the only option left for the sixth audition is Lugo's audition.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  The fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition must be either Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition, and Trillo's audition must be either the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition, and Yoshida's audition must be either the fifth or sixth audition.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Lugo's audition must be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Lugo's audition.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it cannot be Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  Therefore, the only possible option for the sixth audition is Trillo's audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded, and the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the sixth audition must be one of the four that are not recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the first, second, or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  Based on these conditions, the only possible option for the sixth audition is Trillo's audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so either Kammer or Lugo will be the fifth audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so either Waite, Trillo, Yoshida, or Zinn will be the fourth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite cannot be the fifth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so if Kammer is the fifth audition, Trillo cannot be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so if Zinn is the fifth audition, Yoshida cannot be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the possible candidates for the sixth audition are Trillo, Waite, and Yoshida.
  However, if Yoshida is the sixth audition, then Zinn's audition would have to be earlier than Yoshida's audition, which contradicts the given conditions.
  Therefore, Yoshida cannot be the sixth audition.
  If Trillo is the sixth audition, then Kammer's audition would have to be earlier than Trillo's audition, which contradicts the given conditions.
  Therefore, Trillo cannot be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the only possible candidate for the sixth audition is Waite.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded, so Kammer's audition must be the first or second audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be the first, second, or third audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so Trillo's audition cannot be the fourth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition must be the fifth or sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be the first, second, third, or fourth audition.
  Therefore, Lugo's audition could be the sixth audition.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the only possible auditions for recording are the first and second, or the fifth and sixth.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so the only possible auditions for recording are the fifth and sixth.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. So, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth or sixth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. So, Kammer's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. So, if Zinn's audition is the sixth audition, then Yoshida's audition must be either the first or second audition, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Trillo's audition.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so Kammer's audition must be the first audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be the second or the third audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Trillo's audition or Zinn's audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition.

Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there must be no photograph by Fuentes in the Lifestyle section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, there must be no Hue's photograph in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, there must be no Gagnon's photograph in the Sports section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue must be paired with a photograph in the Metro section by Hue or Gagnon.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon must be paired with a photograph in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  Hue's photographs must be in the Lifestyle and Sports sections.
  Fuentes' photographs must be in the Metro and Sports sections.
  From the above, we can conclude that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  We also know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes, who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  We also know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must also have one photograph in the Sports section.
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  We do not have enough information to determine which photographers took the photographs in the Metro section.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue.
  We don't know how many photographs each photographer has in each section, so A, B, and C are not necessarily true.
  D is true because one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  E is not true because we know that one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes.
Answer: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
- One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- There are a total of 6 different photographs, exactly 2 photographs per section.

If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then:
- There must be at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

Let's try to deduce the possible combinations of photographers and their photographs in each section:
- Lifestyle: Gagnon, Hue
- Metro: Fuentes + ?, Gagnon + ?
- Sports: Fuentes + ?, Hue + ?

If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon. Therefore, none of Gagnon's photographs will be in the Lifestyle section, which contradicts the given information. So, A cannot be true.

If exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, there will be two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given information. So, B cannot be true.

If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then there will be no Fuentes photograph in the Metro section. Therefore, there will be three Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given information. So, C cannot be true.

If exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes. Therefore, there will be two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section and one Fuentes photograph in the Metro section. Also, there will be one Hue photograph in the Lifestyle section and one Hue photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, D must be true.

If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then there will be no Fuentes photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, there will be three Fuentes photographs in the Metro section, which contradicts the given information. So, E cannot be true.

Answer: Answer("D")

  Therefore, the two photographers whose photographs appear in the Lifestyle section are Gagnon and Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one of the photographers whose photographs appear in the Lifestyle section must also have a photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, neither of the photographers whose photographs appear in the Lifestyle section can be Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.

  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the photograph in the Lifestyle section with the photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section must be by Hue.
  This means that the photograph in the Metro section with Hue must be the second photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  The photograph in the Sports section with Fuentes must be the second photograph.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The photograph in the Metro section with Gagnon must be the first photograph.

  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  This means that the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  The third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  We also know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  Therefore, we know that there are a total of 15 batches of cookies made during the week.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Therefore, there are at most 14 batches of cookies made from Tuesday to Friday.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, there must be at least one batch of each kind of cookie made from Tuesday to Friday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, either the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday or Friday.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, there must be at least one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies made on Tuesday or Friday.
  We know that there are at most 14 batches of cookies made from Tuesday to Friday.
  Therefore, there can be at most two batches of cookies made on any of these days.
  If two batches of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday, then one batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday, and the other two batches of peanut butter cookies and sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  If two batches of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Friday, then one batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the other two batches of peanut butter cookies and sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, we know that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for when the batches of cookies are made: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday or Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday, Thursday.
  If the batches of cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  If the batches of cookies are made on Monday, Tuesday, Tuesday, and Thursday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on either Tuesday or Friday.
  The answer is either A or B.

  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches made on Wednesday: (1) no batches are made on Wednesday, or (2) one batch of each kind of cookie is made on Wednesday.
  If no batches are made on Wednesday, then there are four batches of cookies made on Tuesday, and three batches of cookies made on Thursday and Friday.
  If one batch of each kind of cookie is made on Wednesday, then there are two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, and four batches of cookies made on Thursday and Friday.
  If there are four batches of cookies made on Tuesday, then at least two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, which violates a condition.
  If there are fewer than three batches of cookies made on Friday, then there are fewer than three batches of oatmeal cookies made in total, which violates a condition.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.

  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, we can deduce that:
  - The first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, since the second batch is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, since the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day.
  - The first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday or Friday, since the second batch is made on Thursday.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of cookies must be made on Friday.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then the third batch of cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, we can conclude that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possibilities for the batches made on Wednesday: either no batches are made on Wednesday, or all three batches are made on Wednesday.
  If no batches are made on Wednesday, then at least two batches of cookies must be made on either Monday or Thursday.
  If all three batches are made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Monday, which is not possible. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday.
  If the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday and the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible. Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are three types of cookies, and three batches of each type are made every week.
  We know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce that the third batch of oatmeal cookies and the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  This means that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only two possible schedules for the cookies: M-T-TH or M-T-F.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so we can eliminate the possibility of M-T-TH because the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the schedule must be M-T-F.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  This means that only two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, and the third batch of cookies must be made on Friday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then we can deduce some information:
  1. There are only two batches of cookies made on Tuesday, which are the second batch of oatmeal cookies and the first batch of sugar cookies.
  2. The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
  3. The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Thursday, and the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, Friday must have exactly three batches of cookies made, which are the third batches of oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar cookies.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only 2 days left to make 3 batches of each kind of cookie.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. This means that B is true.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 94 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A teacher will assign each of five students—Juana, Kelly, Lateefah, Mei, and Olga—to exactly one of two research teams, the green team and the red team. One team will have two members, and the other will have three members. One member of each team will be designated as facilitator. The assignment must satisfy the following conditions: Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is. Lateefah is assigned to the green team. Kelly is not a facilitator. Olga is a facilitator.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
  B: Lateefah is a facilitator.
  C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are 3 members in the green team, so there are 2 other members in the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator, so either Juana or Mei will be a facilitator in the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she cannot be in the same team as Juana.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Mei can be assigned to the green team as a facilitator or to the red team as a non-facilitator.
  So, Juana and Mei may or may not be both facilitators.
  The only certain statement is that Olga is assigned to the green team.
  The answer is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person. Red team: Juana and Mei. (2) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and one other person. Red team: Juana and Mei.
  In both configurations, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and is not a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the green team and is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: Green team (Lateefah, Olga, and Mei) and Red team (Juana and Kelly).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga is not a facilitator.
  If Olga is assigned to the green team, then Juana is assigned to the red team.
  If Juana and Mei are not both facilitators, then Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible configurations for the team assignments: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, and Mei; Red team: Juana and Kelly. (2) Green team: Lateefah, Kelly, and Olga; Red team: Juana and Mei.
  In configuration (1), Juana is assigned to the red team, Mei is not a facilitator, and Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. In configuration (2), Olga is assigned to the green team, Lateefah is not a facilitator, and neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or E.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, the green team has three members and the red team has two members.
  Olga is assigned to a team as a facilitator, and there is only one facilitator per team.
  Therefore, Olga is assigned to the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Kelly is a member of the red team.
  Mei is the only remaining member of the green team and must be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Mei and Olga are both facilitators.
  Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  Therefore, D is false.
  The only option left is E, which must be true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team assignments: (1) green team: Lateefah, Olga, Mei; red team: Juana, Kelly or (2) green team: Lateefah, Mei, Kelly; red team: Juana, Olga.
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei must be assigned to the green team. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators. 
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga cannot be a facilitator. 
  If Olga is assigned to the green team, then Mei must be assigned to the red team. Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team. 
  If neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator, then Olga must be a facilitator on the green team, which means Juana is assigned to the red team.
  The only option that must be true is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team with Lateefah and Olga as facilitator, and red team with Juana, Kelly, and Mei, with Olga as the facilitator.
  Juana cannot be on the same team as Olga.
  Therefore, Juana must be on the red team.
  Mei is the only person left to be assigned to the red team, and Mei must be a facilitator.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  Lateefah is a member of the green team, but we don't know if she is a facilitator.
  Olga is assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is A: Juana is assigned to the red team.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator and Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (Lateefah, Olga, and one other person) and red team (Juana, Kelly, and Mei).
  If Juana is assigned to the red team, then Mei is assigned to the red team as well. Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  If Lateefah is a facilitator, then Olga is not a facilitator, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  If Olga is assigned to the green team, then Lateefah is not assigned to the green team, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, Olga is not assigned to the green team.
  Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator because Olga is the only facilitator.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned to a team and is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  There are only two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  Therefore, Mei must be on the same team as Juana.
  If Mei is a facilitator, then Juana and Mei are both facilitators.
  If Mei is not a facilitator, then Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The answer is D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  Therefore, the team with Lateefah must have three members and Olga must be on the other team with Juana.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she cannot be on the same team as Kelly.
  Therefore, Kelly must be on the team with Lateefah.
  This leaves Mei to be on the same team as Juana and Olga.
  One team has two members and the other has three members, so Mei, Juana, and Olga must be on the team with three members.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the red team, Olga is assigned to the green team, and Kelly and Lateefah are facilitators.
  This means that D and E are false.

### Temperature: 4.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings because it will end up with a class 3 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building or one class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one class 1 building, then RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for one class 2 building, then Southco must own a class 2 building.
  Therefore, either RealProp owns a class 1 building or Southco owns a class 2 building.
  If Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, then Southco must own a class 2 building because Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("A or C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must have traded one of its class 2 buildings with Southco.
  Southco must have given Trustcorp two class 3 buildings in exchange for one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must own at least one class 3 building after the trade with Southco.
  The only class 3 building available for Trustcorp to own is the Yates House, which is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, RealProp must have traded the Yates House with Trustcorp, and RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:

  Trustcorp can trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings with RealProp, then RealProp will own two class 3 buildings and no class 1 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings with Southco, then Southco will own two class 3 buildings and no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns all class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is possible.
  After some number of trades, Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded all class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only class 2 and class 1 buildings.
  Southco has not traded with Trustcorp for class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must have traded with RealProp for class 2 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 2 building, the Lynch Building.
  Southco can only trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must have made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  In order to make a trade with Trustcorp, Southco must give Trustcorp one of its class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco cannot own only class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings, then it must have traded both the Meyer Building and the Ortiz Building for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must own the King Building.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, so it must trade it for one other building of the same class.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings would result in Trustcorp owning at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot make any trades of the third kind.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 2 buildings, then Southco must own at least one class 2 building.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings is possible.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Trustcorp will own only class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, then Southco must trade a class 2 building for a class 1 building, so that Trustcorp can trade one of its class 3 buildings for two class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must own a class 1 building after some number of trades.
  The only option that satisfies this is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade for class 3 buildings is to trade a class 2 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp cannot trade for class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it must be for a class 1 building or two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 1 building, it must be for two class 2 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades two class 2 buildings, they must be for two class 1 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one or both of its class 2 buildings for class 1 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building, so Trustcorp must trade with RealProp.
  Therefore, RealProp must own a class 2 building after the trade.
  The only class 2 building that RealProp owns is the Yates House.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for the Yates House.
  The Yates House is a class 3 building, so Trustcorp must trade another class 2 building for another class 1 building.
  Southco owns only one class 1 building, so Trustcorp must trade with Southco.
  Therefore, Southco must own at least one class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, Southco must trade its class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade the Lynch Building for the Zimmer House and the Ortiz Building.
  Therefore, RealProp owns the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade for a class 3 building, Trustcorp must trade a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, it must have traded both of its class 2 buildings.
  Thus, Trustcorp must have made at least one trade with either RealProp or Southco.
  If Trustcorp traded with RealProp, then RealProp must have a class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp traded with Southco, then Southco must have a class 2 building.
  Therefore, either RealProp or Southco owns a class 2 building.
  The only answer choice that reflects this conclusion is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.

The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.

  Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the first four slots must be either Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite or Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite.
  If the order of the first four slots is Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert, Vegemite, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, and Uneasy must perform in slot five.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
Action: Answer("A")

  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, if Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot one, then Vegemite must perform in slot two and Uneasy must perform in slot three.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot two, then Yardsign must perform in slot one and Vegemite must perform in slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot two, then Uneasy must perform in slot four or slot five.
  If Zircon performs in slot one, then Uneasy must perform in slot five.
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Therefore, if Zircon performs in slot one, then the order is Yardsign, Zircon, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite, and Uneasy.
  If Zircon performs in slot two, then the order is Zircon, Yardsign, Wellspring, Xpert, Vegemite, and Uneasy.
  The only option that could be true is D: Zircon performs in slot two.

- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
- If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then they cannot be featured on day 5 or day 6. Therefore, Rottweilers can be featured on day 5 or day 6.
- This scenario is possible.
- Keep C.

D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
- If Rottweilers are featured on day 5, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 4 or day 6. Therefore, Himalayans can only be featured on day 2 and day 3, which means Manx cannot be featured on day 5.
- Eliminate D.

E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
- If Newfoundlands and Manx are featured on day 6, then Himalayans must be featured on day 2 and day 3. Therefore, Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5 or day 6.
- Eliminate E.

Therefore, the answer is C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
Response 9:
Thought:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
- Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
- Therefore, we can deduce the following:
  - Day 1: Greyhound
  - Day 2: Himalayan cannot be featured. Siamese cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, Manx must be featured.
  - Day 3: Greyhound cannot be featured. Himalayan cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, one of Siamese, Newfoundland, or Rottweiler must be featured.
  - Day 4: Himalayan cannot be featured. Rottweiler cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, one of Siamese, Newfoundland, or Manx must be featured.
  - Day 5: Greyhound cannot be featured. Himalayan cannot be featured. Rottweiler cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, one of Siamese, Newfoundland, or Manx must be featured.
  - Day 6: Himalayan cannot be featured. Siamese cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, one of Newfoundland, Rottweiler, or Manx must be featured.
  - Day 7: Greyhound cannot be featured. Himalayan cannot be featured.
    - Therefore, one of Siamese, Newfoundland, or Manx must be featured.

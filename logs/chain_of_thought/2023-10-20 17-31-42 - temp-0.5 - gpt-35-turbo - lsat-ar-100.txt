### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 1 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: If exactly three of the students review Undulation, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
  B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
  D: Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  E: O'Neill reviews Sunset.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Let's start by identifying the students who could have reviewed Undulation. If exactly three students reviewed Undulation, then the other two students reviewed Tamerlane.
  From the given conditions, we know that Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the student who didn't review Tamerlane is either Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang.
  We also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviewed any play that Jiang reviewed.
  Therefore, Jiang could have reviewed Undulation.
  If Jiang reviewed Undulation, then Megregian and Lopez reviewed Tamerlane and O'Neill and Kramer reviewed Tamerlane.
  This satisfies the condition that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, C: Jiang reviews Undulation could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they cannot be part of the three students who reviewed Undulation.
  Therefore, the three students who reviewed Undulation are Jiang, Lopez, and Megregian.
  From the conditions, we know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang did not review Undulation.
  Option C is false.
  From the conditions, we also know that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian reviewed more than one play.
  If Megregian reviewed Undulation, then he must have reviewed Tamerlane as well, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Megregian did not review Undulation.
  Option A is true.
  Kramer and O'Neill both reviewed Tamerlane, so they did not review Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill did not review Undulation.
  Option B is true.
  Lopez did not review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Lopez did not review any of the plays that Kramer and O'Neill reviewed.
  Therefore, Lopez reviewed Sunset.
  Option D is false.
  O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, O'Neill did not review Sunset.
  Option E is false.
  
Answer: Answer("A") and Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so neither of them can review Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang must review either Tamerlane or Sunset.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Lopez and Kramer will review Tamerlane, which means Jiang must review Sunset.
  If Megregian does not review Undulation, then either Lopez or Kramer must review it, which means Jiang will review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, A and D are not possible.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer must also review Sunset, which means Lopez and Megregian will review Tamerlane and Undulation, which is not possible.
  Therefore, E is not possible.
  This leaves B and C as possible answers.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students do not review Undulation.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the two students who reviewed the same play must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  Therefore, the student who reviewed the third play that Kramer and O'Neill did not review must be one of Jiang, Lopez, or Megregian.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review the third play.
  If Megregian reviewed the third play, then Megregian would have reviewed more plays than Kramer and Lopez, which contradicts the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, the student who reviewed the third play must be Lopez.
  If Lopez reviewed Tamerlane, then Megregian would have reviewed fewer plays than Lopez, which contradicts the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian did not review Tamerlane, so Megregian reviewed Sunset and O'Neill reviewed Sunset or Undulation.
  If O'Neill reviewed Sunset, then no student reviewed Tamerlane, which contradicts the condition that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, O'Neill reviewed Undulation, so the remaining student, Jiang, reviewed Tamerlane.
  The only option that could be true is C: Jiang reviews Undulation.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the only possibility is that Megregian reviews Tamerlane as well.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian, so Megregian must review all three plays.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, so Jiang cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, Jiang must review Tamerlane or Sunset.
  If Jiang reviews Tamerlane, then Lopez and Kramer must review Sunset and Undulation.
  If Jiang reviews Sunset, then Lopez and Kramer must review Tamerlane and Undulation.
  In either case, O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  Therefore, the answer is B: O'Neill does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Let's assume that Megregian reviews all three plays, and Lopez and Kramer review only one play each.
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review Tamerlane and Sunset.
  According to the conditions, Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the other student who reviews Undulation must be Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian reviews Undulation, and he cannot review any other play that Jiang also reviews.
  Since Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian, they can only review one play each. 
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Lopez cannot review Tamerlane. 
  Therefore, Lopez must review Sunset.
  The only remaining question is whether Jiang reviews any of the three plays.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then the answer is C, and the other two students who review Undulation are Megregian and one of the students who reviews Tamerlane and Sunset.
  If Jiang does not review Undulation, then the answer is A, and the other three students who review Undulation are Megregian, Kramer, and either O'Neill or the student who reviews Sunset.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or C.
Action: Answer("A or C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If exactly three students review Undulation, then the other two students must review the same play or plays.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so the other student who could have reviewed Tamerlane is Megregian.
  If Megregian reviews Tamerlane, then neither Kramer nor Lopez could have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Megregian does not review Tamerlane.
  Since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, and exactly three students review Undulation, then Jiang must have reviewed Undulation.
  O'Neill reviews Tamerlane and does not review Undulation, so O'Neill must review Sunset.
  Therefore, Megregian reviews Undulation, and Lopez reviews Tamerlane.
  The only statement that could be true is A: Megregian does not review Undulation.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three students review Undulation.
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the two students who review the same play as each other are either reviewing Undulation or Tamerlane.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews, meaning Jiang cannot review Undulation. This means that if three students review Undulation, Megregian must not be one of them.
  If O'Neill does not review Undulation, then the two students who review the same play as each other must be reviewing Tamerlane. This means that O'Neill and Kramer both review Tamerlane, and no one else can review Tamerlane. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  If Jiang reviews Undulation, then two other students must also review Undulation. This means that Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane, and Megregian and Lopez must review Sunset. This satisfies all the conditions, so this choice is possible.
  If Lopez reviews Tamerlane, then Kramer must also review Tamerlane. This means that O'Neill must review Undulation, and Megregian and Jiang must review Sunset. This satisfies all the conditions, so this choice is possible.
  If O'Neill reviews Sunset, then Kramer and O'Neill must review Tamerlane, and Megregian and Lopez must review Undulation. This means that Jiang cannot review any of the three plays, which violates the conditions. Therefore, this choice is not possible.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the other two students must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Therefore, Kramer must have reviewed Undulation.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Therefore, Jiang must have reviewed Tamerlane.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Therefore, Megregian must have reviewed all three plays.
  If Megregian reviewed all three plays, then he did review Undulation. Therefore, A is not true.
  We already know that O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, B is not true.
  We already know that Jiang reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, C is not true.
  Lopez reviewed fewer plays than Megregian. Therefore, D is not true.
  We already know that O'Neill reviewed Tamerlane. Therefore, E is not true.
  None of the above is true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that there are 3 plays and 5 students.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  If exactly three of the students review Undulation, then the remaining two students must review a different play.
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so Megregian and Lopez must review Sunset and Tamerlane or Sunset and Undulation.
  We know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  If Megregian reviews Sunset and Tamerlane, then neither Lopez nor Megregian can review Undulation because Jiang must review Undulation.
  Therefore, Megregian must review Undulation.
  If Megregian reviews Undulation, then Lopez must review Sunset and Tamerlane.
  O'Neill reviews Tamerlane, so he cannot review Undulation.
  Therefore, O'Neill does not review Undulation.
  The only remaining answer choice is C, which is that Jiang reviews Undulation.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 2 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: Which one of the following targets CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients?
Choices:
  A: a 1-day website target
  B: a 2-day voicemail target
  C: a 2-day website target
  D: a 3-day voicemail target
  E: a 3-day website target
Response 0:
Thought:
  The maintenance company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  There are 6 targets in total, 2 targets for each client.
  Each target is either a 1-day, 2-day or 3-day response time.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  The target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients must violate one of the above conditions.
  A 1-day website target can be set for all three clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
  A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide, because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
  A 3-day website target cannot be set for any client, because it violates the condition that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, the answer is E: a 3-day website target.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  There are three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  The six targets are set according to the following conditions: 
    1. None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
    2. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
    3. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  The shortest target is a 1-day website target.
  The longest target is a 3-day voicemail target.
  The target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is the one that violates any of the three conditions.
  A 1-day website target can be set for all the clients.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all the clients.
  A 2-day website target violates condition 3 because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, a 2-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
  A 3-day voicemail target violates condition 1 because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, a 3-day voicemail target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
  A 3-day website target violates condition 1 because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, a 3-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
  Therefore, the answer is C: a 2-day website target.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The maintenance company sets two service targets for each client.
  The targets are 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day.
  The company cannot set a website target longer than a voicemail target.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  We need to identify the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
  The 1-day website target and the 2-day voicemail target can be set for more than one of the clients.
  The 2-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest.
  The 3-day voicemail target can be set for Image and Truvest.
  The 3-day website target can be set for Image, Solide, and Truvest.
  Therefore, the answer is B: a 2-day voicemail target.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The company has three clients: Image, Solide, and Truvest.
- Two targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
- There are three service targets: 3 days, 2 days, and 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- We need to find the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
- A 1-day website target can be set for Solide and Truvest.
- A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients.
- A 2-day website target cannot be set for Solide because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
- A 3-day voicemail target can be set for Solide and Image.
- A 3-day website target can be set for all three clients.
- Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 2-day website target.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which target can be unique to only one client.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If we look at the targets, we can see that a 1-day website target may be too aggressive for some clients.
  Therefore, A: a 1-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The 1-day website target cannot be set for more than one of the clients because the targets are set according to the following conditions:
  - None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  - Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Therefore, the answer is A: a 1-day website target.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to identify a target that can only be set for one client.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. So, Image's voicemail target cannot be a 3-day target.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. So, Solide's website target cannot be a 3-day target.
  Therefore, the only target that cannot be set for more than one of the clients is a 1-day website target.
  The answer is A: a 1-day website target.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find a target that can only be set for one client.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This means that Image must have a voicemail target of 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This means that Solide must have a website target of 1 day and Truvest must have a website target of 2 days.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. This means that Image cannot have a website target longer than 1 day.
  Therefore, the target that cannot be set for more than one client is a 3-day voicemail target.
  The answer is D: a 3-day voicemail target.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  There are three targets: 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day.
  Two targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If a target is set for more than one client, it must meet all the conditions for all the clients.
  A 2-day website target can be set for both Solide and Truvest, as long as Solide's website target is shorter than Truvest's website target.
  A 2-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, as long as Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  A 3-day website target can be set for all three clients, as long as none of them have a voicemail target longer than 2 days.
  A 1-day website target can be set for all three clients, as long as none of them have a voicemail target longer than 2 days.
  A 3-day voicemail target can be set for all three clients, as long as Image's voicemail target is shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets and none of them have a website target shorter than 2 days.
  Therefore, the target that CANNOT be set for more than one of the clients is D: a 3-day voicemail target.
Action: Answer("D")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 3 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following could be the buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made?
Choices:
  A: RealProp: the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower Southco: the Lynch Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  B: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the King Building, and the Ortiz Building Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the Meyer Building, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House
  C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  D: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Meyer Building, and the Yates House Southco: the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building Trustcorp: the King Building, the Ortiz Building, and the Zimmer House
  E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to make one trade.
  The three companies can trade only between buildings of the same class or between buildings of different classes as described in the question.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, we can only trade one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp can trade Garza Tower (class 1) for two class 2 buildings. This leaves RealProp with two class 3 buildings.
  Southco can trade Lynch Building (class 2) for two class 3 buildings. This leaves Southco with one class 1 building.
  Trustcorp can trade two class 3 buildings for one class 2 building. This leaves Trustcorp with two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, after one trade, the buildings owned by the three companies could be:
  RealProp: the Yates House and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Flores Tower
  Trustcorp: the King Building and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  A trade can only be of one of the three kinds: (1) Trading one building for one other building of the same class, (2) Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or (3) Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, we can eliminate answer choices that do not follow the given rules.
  Answer choices A, B, and D have buildings that are not of the same class being traded for each other, so they are incorrect.
  Answer choice C has RealProp trading the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building, for the Lynch Building and Zimmer House, which are class 2 and class 3 buildings, respectively. This violates the rules of the trade. 
  Answer choice E has RealProp trading the Garza Tower, which is a class 1 building, for the Flores Tower and Lynch Building, which are class 1 and class 2 buildings, respectively. This is a valid trade.
  Therefore, the answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  The possible trades are:
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower (class 1), it can only trade it for the Flores Tower (class 1) from Southco.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower (class 1), it can only trade it for the Garza Tower (class 1) from RealProp.
  If Trustcorp trades any of its class 2 buildings, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings from RealProp or Southco.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is between RealProp and Southco, where they trade their class 1 buildings.
  After the trade, RealProp will have a class 1, a class 2, and a class 3 building.
  Southco will have a class 1 and a class 3 building.
  Trustcorp will have three class 2 buildings.
  The only answer that matches this is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  There are only two class 1 buildings, the Garza Tower and the Flores Tower, so if one of them is traded, the other company must receive two class 2 buildings. 
  If one of the class 2 buildings is traded, the other company must receive two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower or the Yates House, Southco must trade the Flores Tower or the Lynch Building, and Trustcorp must trade one of the three class 2 buildings.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower, which is also a class 1 building.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the King Building or the Ortiz Building, which are class 2 buildings.
  Option C is possible because RealProp can trade the Garza Tower for the Lynch Building, Southco can trade the Flores Tower for the Yates House and the Zimmer House, and Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the two class 3 buildings.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp cannot trade the Meyer Building, which is a class 2 building.
  Option E is not possible because Southco cannot trade the Lynch Building, which is a class 2 building.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building, Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House, Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns one class 1, and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 and one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, each company must trade one building for another building of the same class, or one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the only way to trade is for Southco to trade the Flores Tower for two class 3 buildings.
  The only two class 3 buildings are the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade one of its class 3 buildings for the Flores Tower.
  The only class 3 building that RealProp owns that has not been used is the Yates House.
  Thus, RealProp trades the Yates House for the Flores Tower, and Southco trades the Flores Tower for the Yates House and the Zimmer House.
  Therefore, the possible buildings owned by the three companies after only one trade is made are:
  RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Zimmer House
  Southco: the Lynch Building
  Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building
  The answer is E: RealProp: the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Southco: the Lynch Building; Trustcorp: the Flores Tower, the King Building, and the Meyer Building. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  There are three types of trades that can be made:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We need to find a combination of trades that could result in the given buildings owned by each company.
  Option A is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Option B is not possible because Trustcorp would need to trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Option C is possible if RealProp trades the Garza Tower for the Flores Tower and Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Lynch Building and the Ortiz Building.
  Option D is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Option E is not possible because RealProp would need to trade a class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The trades can only be made between the buildings of the same class or between class 1 and 2, or between class 2 and 3.
  Therefore, the possible trades are:
    1. Garza Tower for Flores Tower and Lynch Building
    2. Garza Tower for King Building and Ortiz Building
    3. Yates House for two class 2 buildings
    4. Zimmer House for two class 3 buildings
  Option A is not possible because RealProp cannot trade Garza Tower and Flores Tower is already owned by Southco.
  Option B is not possible because RealProp cannot trade Yates House for King Building and Ortiz Building.
  Option C is possible because Garza Tower can be traded for Flores Tower and Yates House can be traded for King Building and Ortiz Building.
  Option D is not possible because Yates House is class 3 and cannot be traded for Meyer Building which is class 2.
  Option E is not possible because Zimmer House is class 3 and cannot be traded for Flores Tower which is class 1.
  Therefore, the answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building; Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The only way to trade is:
    1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  RealProp has a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Southco has a class 1 building and a class 2 building.
  Trustcorp has three class 2 buildings.
  To make a trade, the only possible option is to trade the Flores Tower (class 1) for two class 3 buildings. 
  Therefore, Southco will trade Flores Tower (class 1) for Yates House (class 3) and Zimmer House (class 3).
  The new ownership of the buildings will be:
  RealProp: Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco: Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp: King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  The only answer that matches the new ownership of the buildings is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Trading one building for one other building of the same class, RealProp cannot trade the Garza Tower for any building because there is no other class 1 building.
  Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings, Southco cannot trade the Flores Tower because there is no two class 2 buildings to trade for.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp cannot trade any of its class 2 buildings because there is no two class 3 buildings to trade for.
  Therefore, the only possible trade is RealProp trading one of its class 3 buildings for one of Southco's class 2 buildings.
  RealProp can trade the Yates House or the Zimmer House for the Lynch Building.
  The answer is C: RealProp: the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building; Southco: the Flores Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House; Trustcorp: the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  There are three types of trades allowed.
  After one trade, each company must still own three buildings.
  The only possible trade for RealProp is to trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings, which means RealProp will own two class 3 buildings and one class 2 building.
  The only possible trade for Southco is to trade the Flores Tower for two class 3 buildings, which means Southco will own one class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  The only possible trade for Trustcorp is to trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings, which means Trustcorp will own one class 1 building, one class 2 building, and one class 3 building.
  Therefore, the only answer choice that satisfies the above conditions is E.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 4 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If U is mentioned in chapter 3, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 1.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 7.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Response 0:
Thought:
  U is mentioned in chapter 3, which means X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 7. That leaves T to be mentioned in chapter 4, 5, or 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S cannot be in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5 and Z cannot be in chapter 1, 2, 6, or 7.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W cannot be in chapter 3 and X cannot be in chapter 5 or 7.
  From the above constraints, we can determine that T must be in chapter 6, W must be in chapter 7, and Z must be in chapter 1.
  That leaves R to be in chapter 2 or 5.
  Therefore, the answer is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 2, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then X cannot be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  So, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  Since T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  From the constraints, T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, the order of mentioning T, U, and X must be T-U-X or X-U-T.
  If T is mentioned before U, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6, and X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, the possible order of mentioning the clues is R, T, U, X, W, S, Z or R, T, U, X, S, W, Z.
  From the possible order, the only option that could be true is E: X is mentioned in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4. 
  Since there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 5. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6. Therefore, D is possible.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7. Therefore, D is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7, which is not possible.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then S must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 7, which is not possible.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is B: R is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  T must be mentioned before W, with exactly two chapters separating T and W.
  If T is not in chapter 1, then it must be in chapter 2, 3, or 4.
  If T is in chapter 2, then W must be in chapter 6.
  If T is in chapter 3, then W must be in chapter 7.
  If T is in chapter 4, then W must be in chapter 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be in chapter 1 or 2.
  If R is in chapter 1, then T cannot be in chapter 2, which is a contradiction.
  If R is in chapter 5, then Z must be in chapter 6, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, 4, or 5 because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so if S is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or vice versa.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 1, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or earlier.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 7, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 6.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W must be either in chapter 5 or 6.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be in chapter 2 and W must be in chapter 6.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so Z must be in chapter 7 and S must be in either chapter 1 or chapter 5.
  R is the only clue left, and it can be in either chapter 1 or chapter 5.
  Therefore, R could be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, S and Z can only be mentioned in the following ways: (S, R, X, T, W, U, Z) or (R, S, X, T, W, U, Z).
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 1 or chapter 5.
  Answer: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 4, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 or 5.
  If T is not mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 7, then R must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, which means S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7, and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 or 2.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 5 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: For the school paper, five students—Jiang, Kramer, Lopez, Megregian, and O'Neill—each review one or more of exactly three plays: Sunset, Tamerlane, and Undulation, but do not review any other plays. The following conditions must apply: Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian. Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane. Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
Question: Which one of the following could be an accurate and complete list of the students who review Tamerlane?
Choices:
  A: Jiang, Kramer
  B: Kramer, O'Neill
  C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  D: Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  E: Lopez, Megregian, O'Neill
Response 0:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, either Kramer and O'Neill are the two students who review the same play or plays, or one of them reviews Tamerlane while the other one reviews Sunset or Undulation.
  The list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  Jiang does not review any play that either Lopez or Megregian reviews, and there is no information on whether Jiang reviews Tamerlane, so Jiang may or may not review Tamerlane.
  Megregian reviews fewer plays than Kramer and Lopez, so Megregian may or may not review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the possible lists of students who review Tamerlane are:
  - Kramer, O'Neill
  - Kramer, Megregian, O'Neill
  - Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill
  The only one of these lists that is among the answer choices is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane, so they must be included in the list.
  The list must include exactly two students who review the same play or plays as each other.
  If Megregian is included in the list, then the third student must be either Kramer or O'Neill, but that would violate the requirement that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  If Jiang is included in the list, then Megregian cannot be included in the list because neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews. That would also violate the requirement that exactly two students review the same play or plays as each other.
  The only remaining option is Lopez.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
- Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
- Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
- Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
- Jiang's play choices are not specified.
- We need to find the list of students who review Tamerlane.
- Based on the information given, the possible students who could review Tamerlane are Kramer, O'Neill, and Megregian.
- The list of students who review Tamerlane should have exactly two names.
- Jiang is not included in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
- Lopez cannot be included in the list of students who review Tamerlane since neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
- Therefore, the possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill or Kramer and Megregian.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill are in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang review any play that Kramer and O'Neill do not review.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane cannot include Lopez, Megregian, or Jiang.
  The list of students who review Tamerlane must include exactly two students.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  So, the answer must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  From the answer choices, only B and C include Kramer and O'Neill.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the answer must be C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be two of the students who review Tamerlane.
  No other student can review Tamerlane since only three plays are reviewed by the five students and two of the students have already reviewed Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include Kramer and O'Neill.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  We also know that exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Jiang, Lopez, Megregian, or some combination of those students.
  However, we also know that neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot be the other student who reviews Tamerlane.
  This means that the other student who reviews Tamerlane must be either Kramer, O'Neill, or some combination of those two students.
  Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is either Kramer and O'Neill or Kramer, Lopez, and O'Neill.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Kramer, O'Neill or C: Kramer, Lopez, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the students who review Tamerlane can also review Sunset or Undulation because only two students can review the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must be a subset of Kramer, O'Neill, and Megregian.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Megregian must review at least two plays.
  Neither Lopez nor Megregian reviews any play Jiang reviews.
  Therefore, Jiang cannot be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  The only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
  The answer is B: Kramer, O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill must be part of the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students can review Tamerlane because it would violate one of the given conditions.
  Jiang does not review any play that Megregian reviews, so Jiang cannot review Tamerlane.
  Megregian cannot review Tamerlane because it is already assigned to Kramer and O'Neill.
  Lopez cannot review Tamerlane because it would violate the condition that Kramer and Lopez each review fewer plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, the only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Kramer and O'Neill both review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, Kramer and O'Neill are in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  None of the other students review Tamerlane.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane cannot include Jiang or Megregian.
  Kramer and Lopez each review fewer of the plays than Megregian.
  Therefore, Lopez cannot be in the list of students who review Tamerlane.
  Exactly two of the students review exactly the same play or plays as each other.
  Therefore, the list of students who review Tamerlane must include exactly two students.
  The only possible list of students who review Tamerlane is Kramer and O'Neill.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 7 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower (class 1), Yates House (class 3), and Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns Flores Tower (class 1) and Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns King Building (class 2), Meyer Building (class 2), and Ortiz Building (class 2).
  Trades can only happen between same-class buildings or between class 1 and class 2 or between class 2 and class 3.
  RealProp does not own Flores Tower, and Southco does not own Garza Tower.
  Southco does not own Meyer Building since it is owned by Trustcorp.
  Trustcorp does not own Garza Tower since it is owned by RealProp.
  Therefore, A, B, and E cannot be true.
  C and D are possible since they involve buildings owned by Southco and Trustcorp respectively.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  There are three types of trades that can be made.
  If RealProp trades the Garza Tower, it can only trade it for a building of the same class or two class 2 buildings.
  If Southco trades the Flores Tower, it can only trade it for a building of the same class or two class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building, it can only trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  A cannot be true because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C cannot be true because Southco does not own the Garza Tower.
  D can be true because Trustcorp can own the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building.
  E can be true because Trustcorp can own the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp has no class 2 building, Southco has no class 3 building, Trustcorp has no class 1 building.
  A: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, so it cannot be owned by RealProp.
  B: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, but the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be owned by Southco.
  C: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, but the Lynch Building is owned by Southco, so it cannot be owned by Southco.
  D: The Flores Tower is owned by Southco, but the Ortiz Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
  E: The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp, but the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, so it cannot be owned by Trustcorp.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which option is impossible, no matter how many trades are made.
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  Option A is impossible because RealProp does not own the Flores Tower. 
  Option B is possible because Southco can trade the Lynch Building for the Meyer Building.
  Option C is impossible because RealProp owns the Garza Tower, not Southco.
  Option D is possible because Trustcorp can trade the King Building for the Flores Tower.
  Option E is impossible because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp does not own the Flores Tower. Therefore, A is false.
  Southco does not own the Meyer Building. Therefore, B is false.
  Southco does not own the Garza Tower. Therefore, C is false.
  Trustcorp does not own the Flores Tower. Therefore, D is false.
  RealProp does not own the Meyer Building. Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building. Therefore, E is false.
  All the options are false. Therefore, None of the above is the answer.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower because it is owned by Southco.
  Southco cannot own the Meyer Building and the Garza Tower together because they are owned by RealProp.
  Southco cannot own the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building together because they are owned by RealProp and Southco respectively.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building because they are owned by RealProp and Southco respectively.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building together because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp.
  Therefore, A, B, C, D, and E cannot be true.
  The answer is (E) The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can start by making a chart of the buildings owned by each company and their class.
  RealProp: Garza Tower (1), Yates House (3), Zimmer House (3)
  Southco: Flores Tower (1), Lynch Building (2)
  Trustcorp: King Building (2), Meyer Building (2), Ortiz Building (2)
  Since each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: 
  1. Trading one building for one other building of the same class
  2. Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
  3. Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  We can use this information to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower. (Not possible because Flores Tower is owned by Southco)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Flores Tower and the Meyer Building. (Possible because both are owned by Trustcorp)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (Not possible because Garza Tower is owned by RealProp)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Ortiz Building. (Not possible because Ortiz Building is class 2 and Flores Tower is class 1)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (Not possible because Garza Tower is owned by RealProp)
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  RealProp cannot own the Flores Tower since it is owned by Southco.
  Southco cannot own the Meyer Building and RealProp cannot own the Garza Tower since they are both class 1 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Flores Tower since it is owned by Southco.
  Trustcorp cannot own the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building since they are both class 1 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:

  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp does not own the Flores Tower.
  Southco does not own the Garza Tower or the Yates House.

  Therefore, choices A, B, and E cannot be true.
  Choice C is possible, as RealProp could own the Lynch Building and Southco could own the Garza Tower.
  Choice D is possible, as RealProp could own the Flores Tower and Trustcorp could own the Ortiz Building.
  The answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Flores Tower and the Garza Tower.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.

Choices:
  A: Franco is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday as Hong does not testify on Monday.
Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.
Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday.
Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Franco cannot testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday.
Garcia does not testify on the same day as Franco, so Garcia cannot testify on Monday.
Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
Thus, the only remaining day for Iturbe to testify is Wednesday.
Therefore, Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Therefore, the answer is E: Iturbe is the only witness scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  If Franco testifies on the same day as Hong, then Garcia cannot testify on the same day as Franco and Hong.
  Hong does not testify on Monday, so Franco must testify on Monday if he testifies on the same day as Hong.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.
  Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so Garcia and Hong must testify on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Tuesday and Franco is scheduled to testify on Monday.
  The answer is B: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Franco cannot testify on Tuesday because Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
Therefore, Franco must testify on Monday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
Iturbe must testify on Wednesday, so Jackson must testify on Tuesday.
Therefore, the only remaining option is that Hong testifies on Wednesday.
So, the schedule must be: 
Monday: Franco
Tuesday: Jackson, Garcia
Wednesday: Iturbe, Hong
Therefore, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday. The answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
  Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Hong testifies on Tuesday, then Iturbe must testify on Monday, but Iturbe testifies on Wednesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Wednesday.
  If Franco testifies on Wednesday, then Garcia must testify on Monday because exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
  The only witness left to testify on Tuesday is Jackson.
  Therefore, the schedule must be: 
  Monday: Iturbe and Garcia
  Tuesday: Jackson and Franco
  Wednesday: Hong
  Therefore, the correct answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong does not testify on Monday. Therefore, Hong must testify either on Tuesday or Wednesday. Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday. Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday. Exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, so the other witness who testifies on Tuesday must be Garcia. Franco does not testify on the same day that Garcia testifies, so Franco must testify on Monday. At least one witness testifies on Monday, so the remaining witness, Jackson, must testify on Wednesday. Therefore, the schedule is:
Monday: Franco
Tuesday: Garcia, Hong
Wednesday: Iturbe, Jackson
Therefore, the answer is D: Hong is scheduled to testify on Tuesday. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Monday because Hong does not testify on Monday.
Thus, Hong must testify on Tuesday or Wednesday.
Iturbe testifies on Wednesday, so Hong cannot testify on Wednesday.
Therefore, Hong must testify on Tuesday.
Since exactly two witnesses testify on Tuesday, Franco must testify on Monday and Garcia must testify on Wednesday.
Thus, Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
The answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Franco cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  Iturbe testifies on Wednesday.
  Hong does not testify on Monday.
  At least one witness testifies on Monday.
  If Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Hong cannot testify on Tuesday.
  If Hong does not testify on Tuesday, then Hong must testify on Wednesday or Monday.
  If Hong testifies on Wednesday, then Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because he cannot testify on the same day as Garcia.
  If Hong testifies on Monday, then Garcia must testify on Wednesday because he cannot testify on the same day as Franco.
  Therefore, if Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong, then Garcia must be scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  The answer is C: Garcia is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Franco and Garcia cannot testify on the same day.
  Franco is scheduled to testify on the same day as Hong.
  Therefore, Garcia cannot be scheduled on the same day as Franco or Hong.
  The only day left for Garcia to testify is Tuesday.
  Iturbe is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  At least one witness must testify on Monday.
  Hong cannot testify on Monday.
  Therefore, either Franco or Jackson must be scheduled to testify on Monday.
  There are exactly two witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the witnesses scheduled to testify on Tuesday are Franco and Jackson.
  Franco cannot testify on Wednesday because he is scheduled on the same day as Hong.
  Therefore, Jackson is scheduled to testify on Wednesday.
  The schedule is as follows:
  Monday: Hong and Franco or Jackson
  Tuesday: Franco and Jackson

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 9 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order of the auditions, from first to last?
Choices:
  A: Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida
  D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  E: Zinn, Yoshida, Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo
Response 0:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  From these conditions, we can deduce that Waite's audition must be the first or second audition.
  Kammer's audition must be the first or second audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Trillo's, Waite's, or Lugo's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's audition.
  From these conditions, we can deduce that the order of the auditions is: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
  The only choice that matches this order is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be one of the non-recorded ones.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be one of Kammer's or Lugo's.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices and determine the correct order.
  Let's start with option A:
  Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Waite, Lugo, Yoshida
  Since Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's, this order doesn't work.
  Let's move to option B:
  Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
  Since Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, this order works.
  Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's, which is the case in this order.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's, which is the case in this order.
  Therefore, B is the correct answer.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer's or Lugo's audition.
  If the fourth audition is Kammer's, then the fifth audition must be Lugo's, and vice versa.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be first or second.
  Therefore, the first three auditions must be some combination of Waite, Kammer, and Zinn. 
  The remaining three auditions must be some combination of Trillo, Lugo, and Yoshida. 
  The order of the auditions can be determined by considering the possibilities for the first three auditions and the remaining three auditions.
  Checking the answer choices, we can see that only one of them matches these conditions.
  The answer is C: Waite, Lugo, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Yoshida.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Kammer, Lugo, or Trillo.
- The fifth audition must be recorded, so it must be either Kammer or Lugo.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must audition first.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must audition second or third.
- Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must audition fourth or earlier.
- Based on the above conditions, we can eliminate choices A and E because they do not satisfy the condition that Waite must audition before the recorded auditions.
- Choice B violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
- Choice D satisfies all the conditions. 
- Therefore, the answer is D: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida.

- Therefore, the order of auditions must be Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida.
- The correct answer is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
- The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition cannot be the fourth one.
- Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, and the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth one.
- Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, and Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Kammer's audition cannot be the fifth one, and Zinn's audition cannot be the first one.
- From the remaining conditions, we know that Waite's audition must be before Kammer's audition, and Kammer's audition must be before Trillo's audition. Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the fourth one, and Trillo's audition cannot be the first or second one.
- From the above deductions, we can determine that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, Zinn, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Yoshida.
- The only choice that matches this order is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth must be recorded.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  From the remaining answer choices, we can determine which one satisfies the given conditions.
  
Elimination:
  A: Kammer's audition cannot be followed by Trillo's audition.
  C: Kammer's audition cannot be followed by Trillo's audition.
  D: Kammer's audition cannot be followed by Trillo's audition.
  E: We know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Zinn's audition cannot be the last one. Eliminate E.

Verification:
  B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo
     - Kammer's audition is before Trillo's audition.
     - Waite's audition is before the two recorded auditions.
     - Zinn's audition is before Yoshida's audition.
     - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
     - The fifth audition must be recorded.
     - This order satisfies all the given conditions.
     Therefore, the answer is B.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded, so the order must be the following: 
  1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 4th.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite must be first or second.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer must be first or second.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn must be third or earlier.
  Therefore, the only possible order is B: Waite, Kammer, Yoshida, Zinn, Lugo, Trillo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that Kammer's and Lugo's auditions will be recorded.
  We know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded, and the fifth audition must be recorded.
  Based on these conditions, we can determine that the order of the auditions must be: Waite, Kammer, Trillo, Zinn, Lugo, Yoshida.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E.
  Choice B violates the condition that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  Choice C violates the condition that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.

  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  - The fifth audition must be recorded.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  
  From the above conditions, we can infer that:
  - Kammer's audition must be first or second.
  - Trillo's audition must be fifth or sixth.
  - The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it must be either Zinn or Yoshida.
  - Waite's audition must be first, second, or third.
  - Lugo's audition must be last or second to last.
  
  Using these inferences, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - A: Trillo's audition is third, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - C: Kammer's audition is third, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - D: Zinn's audition is second, which violates the condition that Kammer's audition must be earlier than Trillo's audition.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 10 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A corporate manager is selecting employees for a research team. The team will include at least four employees, all from among the following eight: Myers, Ortega, Paine, Schmidt, Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre. The selection is constrained by the following conditions: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
Question: Which one of the following is a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team?
Choices:
  A: Ortega and Schmidt
  B: Ortega and Wong
  C: Paine and Schmidt
  D: Thomson and Yoder
  E: Yoder and Zayre
Response 0:
Thought:
  The question asks for a pair of employees who must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  Ortega and Wong are not connected to each other or to any other employee.
  Thomson and Yoder are not connected to each other or to any other employee.
  Paine and Schmidt are connected to each other, but there is no guarantee that either of them must be on the team.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Ortega and Wong. If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be. If Myers is not on the team, then Ortega must be on the team.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The question asks for a pair of employees that must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  The pair that must be on the team is not Ortega and Schmidt because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  The pair that must be on the team is not Paine and Schmidt because if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  The pair that must be on the team is not Thomson and Yoder because there is no constraint on Thomson and Yoder being on the team.
  The pair that must be on the team is not Yoder and Zayre because there is no constraint on Yoder and Zayre being on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be, therefore the pair that must be on the team is Wong and Myers.
  The answer is B: Ortega and Wong.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to find a pair of employees that must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Ortega and Paine cannot be on the team together.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  None of the given pairs includes both employees who must be on the team.
  However, we can eliminate some pairs:
    - Ortega and Schmidt: If Schmidt is on the team, Paine must also be on the team, and Ortega cannot be on the team.
    - Paine and Schmidt: If Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, and Ortega cannot be on the team.
    - Yoder and Zayre: There is no information about these two employees.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Ortega and Wong. If Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must also be on the team, which means Ortega must be on the team.
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find a pair of employees where at least one of them must be on the team.
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. Therefore, Ortega and Paine cannot be the pair.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team. Therefore, Schmidt and Paine cannot be the pair.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, Wong and Myers cannot be the pair.
  This leaves us with the pairs Thomson and Yoder, and Yoder and Zayre.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Thomson and Yoder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find pairs of employees who have to be on the team. 
If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. 
If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. 
If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
So, we need to find pairs of employees that are not allowed to be together.
Option A: Ortega and Schmidt - Ortega can't be on the team if Myers is on the team, and Schmidt can't be on the team without Paine and Thomson. So, this pair is not required to be on the team.
Option B: Ortega and Wong - Wong must be on the team with Myers and Yoder, so at least one of the pair has to be on the team. This could be Wong.
Option C: Paine and Schmidt - Schmidt must be on the team with Paine and Thomson, so at least one of the pair has to be on the team. This could be Paine.
Option D: Thomson and Yoder - There is no constraint on these two employees. So, this pair is not required to be on the team.
Option E: Yoder and Zayre - There is no constraint on these two employees. So, this pair is not required to be on the team.
Therefore, the answer is either B: Ortega and Wong or C: Paine and Schmidt. 
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The pair of employees must be selected from the employees who must be on the team if one of them is selected.
  Wong must be on the team if Myers and Yoder are on the team.
  Schmidt must be on the team if both Paine and Thomson are on the team.
  Therefore, the pair of employees must be one of the following:
  - Myers and Yoder
  - Paine and Thomson
  Wong is not part of the pair because we are looking for a pair of employees, not three.
  Ortega and Schmidt are not part of the pair because they do not have to be on the team.
  Yoder and Zayre are not part of the pair because they are not related to any of the constraints.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Thomson and Yoder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to identify a pair of employees that have to be selected for the team.
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. So, if Ortega or Paine are not on the team, Myers must be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. So, if Schmidt is on the team, Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. So, if Wong is on the team, Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  Therefore, the pair of employees that must be on the team is Myers and Yoder if Wong is on the team.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
  If Schmidt is on the team, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team.
  Therefore, if Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
  The team will include at least four employees.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If Wong is on the team, then Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. Therefore, the answer must include either Myers or Yoder.
  The only pair that includes either Myers or Yoder is Wong and Yoder.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Thomson and Yoder.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
To solve this problem, we need to find a pair of employees who must be on the team. This means that at least one of the two employees must be on the team.
We know that if Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team.
If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team.
If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team.
Therefore, the only pair of employees that must be on the team is Myers and Yoder, because if Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be on the team. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be.
  We need to find a pair of employees at least one of whom must be on the team.
  If we select Myers, then neither Ortega nor Paine can be on the team. So, we cannot choose Ortega.
  If we select Schmidt, then both Paine and Thomson must be on the team. So, we cannot choose Ortega or Wong.
  If we select Wong, then both Myers and Yoder must be on the team. So, we cannot choose Ortega or Schmidt.
  The remaining employees are Paine, Thomson, Yoder, and Zayre.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 11 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: Which one of the following could be the assignment of parking spaces to the new employees?
Choices:
  A: #1: Young; #2: Souza; #3: Vaughn; #4: Robertson; #5: Togowa; #6: Xu
  B: #1: Vaughn; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Robertson; #6: Xu
  C: #1: Togowa; #2: Young; #3: Xu; #4: Robertson; #5: Souza; #6: Vaughn
  D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu
  E: #1: Souza; #2: Togowa; #3: Young; #4: Robertson; #5: Xu; #6: Vaughn
Response 0:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the parking space assigned to Robertson must be one of the first four spaces.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young must be assigned either space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu must be assigned either space #5 or #6.
  If Xu is assigned space #6, then Young must be assigned space #5.
  If Young is assigned space #6, then Xu must be assigned space #5.
  Therefore, either Xu or Young must be assigned space #5 and the other must be assigned space #6.
  Now, we can eliminate choices A and B because they assign Young to space #3 and #4, respectively, which violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  We can also eliminate choice C because it assigns Togowa to space #1, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  We can eliminate choice E because it assigns Souza to space #1, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is choice D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the possible parking space assignments for Robertson are limited to #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, since Togowa would then be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6, since Souza would then be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Xu.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6, since Young would then be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Robertson.
  From these rules, we know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4.
  Therefore, the only possible parking space assignments for Robertson are #3 or #4.
  Using the remaining rules, we can eliminate some of the answer choices:
  - In option A, Young is assigned parking space #1, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - In option B, Robertson is assigned parking space #5, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - In option C, Young is assigned parking space #2, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - In option E, Souza is assigned parking space #1, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  According to the rules:
  - Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  - Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  - Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  - Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Because Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, we can eliminate choices A and B since they assign Robertson to parking space #5 or #6.
  In choice C, Togowa is assigned parking space #1 which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  In choice D, Togowa is assigned parking space #1 and Robertson is assigned parking space #2 which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5, and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  Considering all the rules and restrictions, only option D satisfies all the conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Choice A assigns Young to parking space #1 which is not possible.
  Choice B assigns Robertson to parking space #5 which is not possible.
  Choice C assigns Togowa to parking space #1 which is not possible.
  Choice D satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, in any valid assignment, Robertson must be assigned one of those four parking spaces.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa must be assigned one of the lower-numbered parking spaces.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza must be assigned one of the lower-numbered parking spaces.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Young must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.
  From the above observations, we can conclude that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.
  Choice A violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Choice B violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Choice C violates the rule that Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Choice D satisfies all the given rules and is a valid assignment.
  Choice E violates the rule that Togowa must be assigned one of the lower-numbered parking spaces.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Using these rules, we can eliminate choices A and E.
  Choice B violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Choice C violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Based on these rules, we can eliminate options A, B, and E.
  Option C violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  From the above rules, we can deduce that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4 and Young must be assigned parking space #5.
  The only answer choice that satisfies these rules is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  From the above rules, we can infer that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, and Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Considering all the above rules, we can see that only option D satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is D: #1: Togowa; #2: Robertson; #3: Young; #4: Souza; #5: Vaughn; #6: Xu.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 12 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
  B: Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  D: Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned to the project, and only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922 because Yoshio is already assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 because Yoshio is already assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is:
  Ryan - 1924
  Yoshio - 1923
  Tiffany - 1922
  Mollie - 1921
  This means that Louis and Onyx are not assigned to the project.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then there are two remaining students, Louis and Tiffany, who need to be assigned to the years 1923 and 1924.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so one of them must be assigned to that year.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, so Ryan would be assigned to one of the years 1921 or 1922.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, so Onyx would be assigned to one of the years 1920 or 1921.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, but those years are already assigned to Onyx and Ryan.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  This means that Louis must be assigned to 1923, and Tiffany must be assigned to 1924.
  Yoshio could be assigned to 1922, so the answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, if both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  The only remaining option is that Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that Ryan is assigned to the project and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, Onyx is assigned to 1923.
  We also know that Yoshio is assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Yoshio is assigned to a year other than 1923 and 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie is not assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Tiffany is not assigned to 1923.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  Therefore, Louis is not assigned to 1923 if Tiffany is assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie is not assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Ryan is not assigned to 1924.
  The only year left for Yoshio to be assigned to is 1921.
  Therefore, Yoshio is assigned to 1921.
  Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because Yoshio is already assigned to that year.
  Therefore, Mollie is assigned to 1922.
  Onyx is assigned to 1923.
  Tiffany is not assigned to 1923.
  Ryan is not assigned to 1924.
  Therefore, Tiffany is assigned to 1924.
  The only year left is 1923.
  Therefore, Louis is assigned to 1923.
  The answer is A: Louis is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned.
  If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned.
  If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922.
  If Yoshio is assigned, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Yoshio can be assigned to 1922, and Mollie can be assigned to 1921.
  The only remaining year is 1923, which can only be assigned to Louis or Tiffany.
  Therefore, Louis could be assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Tiffany must also be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1921 because Onyx is already assigned to 1922.
  Thus, Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to 1923.
  Yoshio is assigned to the remaining year, which is 1924.
  Therefore, Yoshio is assigned to 1924.
  The only remaining year is 1923, which Tiffany must be assigned to.
  Therefore, Tiffany is assigned to 1923 and Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  The only option that is true is C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project, then Louis and Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to 1921 or 1922, which means that Onyx cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx cannot be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, Yoshio could be assigned to 1922, which means that Onyx could be assigned to 1921. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
  - If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1921 or 1922.
  - If Tiffany is assigned, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Ryan must be assigned to 1924.
  - If Louis is assigned, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923. Therefore, Louis must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - If Mollie is assigned, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Yoshio is assigned to the remaining year.
  Possible assignments:
  - Ryan: 1924, Onyx: 1923, Louis: 1921 or 1922, Mollie: 1921 or 1922, Tiffany: not assigned, Yoshio: 1922 or 1923.
  - Yoshio: 1924, Onyx: 1923, Louis: 1921 or 1922, Mollie: 1921 or 1922, Tiffany: 1924, Ryan: not assigned.
  Therefore, it is possible that Onyx is assigned to 1922. 
  The answer is C: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If both Ryan and Yoshio are assigned to the project:
  - Ryan must be assigned to 1924, and Onyx to 1923.
  - Tiffany cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - If Tiffany is not assigned to 1923, then Ryan cannot be assigned to the project because Tiffany must be assigned to the project if Ryan is assigned to the project.
  - Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Yoshio is not assigned to 1921 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  - Therefore, Yoshio is assigned to 1922.
  - The only remaining year is 1921, which must be assigned to Mollie.
  - Louis cannot be assigned to 1923 because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  - Therefore, Louis is not assigned to 1923.
  - Onyx is assigned to 1923.
  - The following could be true: Mollie is assigned to 1921, Onyx is assigned to 1922, and Yoshio is assigned to 1922.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 13 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chemistry class has six lab sessions scheduled over three days—Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday—one session heing held each morning and one each afternoon. Each session will be led by a different lab assistant—Julio, Kevin, Lan, Nessa, Olivia, or Rebecca. The assignment of lab assistants to sessions is constrained as follows: Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day. Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day. Nessa must lead an afternoon session. Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
Question: If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then for how many of the other lab assistants can one determine which sessions they lead?
Choices:
  A: one
  B: two
  C: three
  D: four
  E: five
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on Wednesday or Friday.
  Also, Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on Thursday.
  Therefore, Lan and Olivia must lead sessions on Wednesday and Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Therefore, Julio must lead the Wednesday afternoon session and Olivia must lead the Thursday morning session.
  So, the remaining session is the Wednesday morning session, which must be led by the remaining lab assistant, which is Nessa.
  Therefore, we can determine which sessions Kevin, Rebecca, Lan, Olivia, and Julio lead.
  We cannot determine which session Nessa leads because it is already determined.
  Therefore, for 5 of the other lab assistants, we can determine which sessions they lead.
  The answer is E: five.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  By the last rule, Olivia leads a session on Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, but we don't know which day.
  Nessa leads an afternoon session, and there is only one afternoon session left, which is on Friday.
  By the second rule, Lan cannot lead a session on Friday, so Lan must lead a session on Wednesday.
  That leaves only one session on Thursday morning, which must be led by one of the two remaining lab assistants, either Kevin or Rebecca.
  Therefore, we can determine the session assignment for all the lab assistants except for either Kevin or Rebecca.
  The answer is B: two.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions and Lan and Olivia must lead the Friday sessions.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa will lead the Friday afternoon session.
  That leaves only one session left for the remaining lab assistant, which is the Wednesday morning session.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all lab assistants except for one.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  So, we can start by placing Julio's session on Thursday afternoon.
  Then, Olivia's session must be on Friday.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so their sessions must be on Wednesday or Thursday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so her session must be on either Thursday or Friday.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions of 4 of the other lab assistants. They are:
  - Julio: Thursday afternoon
  - Olivia: Friday morning
  - Lan: Wednesday morning
  - Kevin and Rebecca: Wednesday afternoon or Thursday morning
  We cannot determine Nessa's session, so the answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on either Wednesday or Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so one of them must lead the Wednesday morning session and the other must lead the Friday morning session.
  That leaves only one session left, which is the Wednesday afternoon session, and the only lab assistant left is either Kevin or Rebecca.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions led by all other lab assistants except for Kevin and Rebecca.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  Since Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, Olivia cannot lead any afternoon session, and as a result, she can only lead the Wednesday morning session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, which must be either Thursday or Friday. If they lead sessions on Thursday, then Kevin can only lead the Thursday morning session, and Rebecca can only lead the Thursday afternoon session. If they lead sessions on Friday, then Kevin can only lead the Friday morning session, and Rebecca can only lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which must be either Thursday or Friday. If she leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Julio can only lead the Wednesday morning session, and Lan can only lead the Friday morning session. If she leads the Friday afternoon session, then Julio can only lead the Wednesday morning session, and Lan can only lead the Thursday morning session.
  Therefore, we can determine the session of four lab assistants, which are Julio, Olivia, Kevin, and Rebecca, but we cannot determine the session of Lan and Nessa.
  The answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, we can use the constraints to deduce the possible schedules of the other assistants.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions on the same day, so they can only lead the Wednesday morning and afternoon sessions or the Friday morning and afternoon sessions.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions on the same day, so one of them must lead the Wednesday morning session and the other must lead the Friday morning session.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so she must lead the Wednesday or Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, so Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Therefore, the possible schedule for the six lab sessions are:
  Wednesday morning: Lan or Olivia
  Wednesday afternoon: Kevin or Rebecca
  Thursday morning: the remaining assistant of Lan or Olivia, and Nessa
  Thursday afternoon: Julio
  Friday morning: the remaining assistant of Lan or Olivia, and Kevin or Rebecca
  Friday afternoon: Olivia
  We can determine the sessions led by Kevin, Rebecca, Nessa, and Olivia, so the answer is D: four.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, so Nessa's session must be on Wednesday afternoon.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Kevin and Rebecca's sessions must be on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, so Lan's session must be on Wednesday morning and Olivia's session must be on Friday afternoon.
  Therefore, we can determine the sessions for all of the lab assistants except for one.
  The lab assistant whose session we cannot determine is either Kevin or Rebecca, since they both can lead sessions on either Wednesday or Thursday.
  So, the answer is A: one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Therefore, Kevin and Rebecca must lead the Wednesday sessions.
  Nessa must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's. Therefore, Olivia must lead the Friday morning session.
  Lan cannot lead a session on the same day as Olivia. Therefore, Lan must lead the Wednesday morning session.
  Therefore, the only lab assistant whose session is not determined is Nessa.
  The answer is A: one.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session.
  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's.
  If Julio leads the Thursday afternoon session, then Olivia must lead the Friday afternoon session.
  Nessa cannot lead the Friday afternoon session, so she leads the Wednesday afternoon session.
  Kevin and Rebecca must lead sessions that meet on the same day, so they lead the Wednesday morning and Friday morning sessions.
  The only assistant left is Lan, who must lead the Thursday morning session.
  Therefore, we can determine which sessions all the lab assistants lead except for one.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 14 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We know that Franz's oil cannot be on the same wall as Isaacs' oil.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, we can try to place the remaining paintings on the walls and see which option cannot be true.
  We can place Hidalgo's paintings on walls 1 and 2.
  We can place Franz's paintings on walls 2 and 3.
  We can place Greene's paintings on walls 1 and 4.
  We can place Isaacs's paintings on walls 3 and 4.
  Based on these placements, we can see that option B cannot be true.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then wall 1 would have only watercolors displayed on it, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that each student has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  There are four walls and each wall has one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If we go through all the options, we can eliminate all but one that cannot be true.
  Option C cannot be true because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so each wall must have at least one oil painting.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so each wall must have paintings from at least two students.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's watercolor. This means that Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor. However, this would mean that wall 4 has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, which is not allowed.
  If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. This means that Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's oil. However, this would mean that wall 4 has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. This cannot be true because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that:
  - Each wall has one oil and one watercolor painting.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil.
    - If this is true, then Franz's oil must be on a different wall than Greene's watercolor.
    - This means that Franz's oil is not on Wall 1.
    - But if Franz's oil is not on Wall 1, then Hidalgo's oil must be on Wall 1.
    - This would mean that Hidalgo's watercolor is also on Wall 1, which is a problem since no wall can have only watercolors.
    - Therefore, A cannot be true.
  
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    - If this is true, then Franz's oil cannot be on Wall 1.
    - This means that Hidalgo's oil must be on Wall 1.
    - This also means that Greene's watercolor must be on Wall 1, which is possible since no wall can have only watercolors.
    - Therefore, B can be true.
  
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
    - This is true since we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
    - Therefore, C cannot be false.
  
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
    - If this is true, then Hidalgo's oil must be in the upper position on the same wall.
    - This means that Hidalgo's oil and watercolor are both on the same wall, which is not allowed.
    - Therefore, D cannot be true.
  
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
    - If this is true, then Isaacs's oil cannot be on Wall 4.
    - This means that Isaacs's oil must be on Wall 1, 2, or 3.
    - However, we know that no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so Isaacs's oil cannot be on Wall 2 or 3.
    - Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be on Wall 1.
    - This means that Hidalgo's oil must be on Wall 4, which is possible.
    - Therefore, E can be true.
    
  Based on our analysis, we found that A and D cannot be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate choices that cannot be true.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Choice A cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on another wall. However, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Choice B cannot be true because if Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then Franz's oil must be displayed on another wall. However, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, and no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Choice C can be true because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Choice D can be true because there is no condition that restricts Hidalgo's watercolor to be displayed in a lower position.
  Choice E cannot be true because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that Franz and Isaacs can't be on the same wall.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Let's examine each statement:
    A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then it means that Franz's oil and Greene's watercolor will also be on that wall. This is possible since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this statement can be true.
    B: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then it means that Franz's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor will also be on that wall. This is possible since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this statement can be true.
    C: This statement is possible since it is stated that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
    D: This statement is possible since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it and no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
    E: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, then it means that Isaacs's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor will also be on that wall. This is not possible since no wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  The answer is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:

  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
     This is possible based on the given information.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil.
     This is not possible since Isaacs's work cannot be on the same wall as Hidalgo's work.
  Therefore, the answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that:
  - Each of the four walls has exactly two paintings, an oil and a watercolor.
  - No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  - No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  - No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  We need to check which option violates these conditions.
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. - This is possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. - This is possible because no wall has only the work of one student displayed on it.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - This is not possible because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. - This is possible because we only know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. - This is not possible because no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.

  - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  - Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  
  A: If Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, then the wall would have only paintings by two students, which is not allowed. This could not be true.
  B: Franz's watercolor could be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, and this would satisfy all the conditions. This could be true.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed. This is opposite to what is given in the conditions. This could not be true.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor could be displayed in a lower position, and this would satisfy all the conditions. This could be true.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor could be displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil, and this would satisfy all the conditions. This could be true.

  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Let's evaluate each statement:
  A: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil. - This is possible based on the given condition.
  B: Franz's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. - This is possible based on the given condition.
  C: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. - This is impossible because we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, this statement cannot be true.
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed in a lower position. - This is possible based on the given conditions.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Hidalgo's oil. - This is impossible because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, and we know that Isaacs's oil is displayed on wall 4.

  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then no one else can give a report on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on any day.
  Therefore, we need to check all possible pairs to see if they can give reports on Wednesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then the remaining two reports on Tuesday must be given by Olivia and Robert.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then the remaining two reports on Monday must be given by Helen and Irving.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then the remaining two reports on Tuesday must be given by Helen and Irving.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then the remaining two reports on Monday must be given by George and Lenore.
  Therefore, the only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other is George and Lenore.
  The answer is A: George and Lenore.

  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday.
  If Helen and Irving give reports on Wednesday, then George cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday, then George and Lenore must give reports on Wednesday.
  The answer is A: George and Lenore.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
- We know that on Tuesday, George must give a report.
- We also know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, so they must give morning reports.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day, Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday, otherwise, Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
- Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
- This means that Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
- Kyle cannot give a report on Monday, because otherwise, there would be no one left to give a report on Wednesday.
- Therefore, Kyle must give a report on Tuesday, and Lenore must give a report on Monday.
- George is the only person left to give a report on Monday.
- The only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday are Helen and Nina, because Nina must give a report on Wednesday, and if Helen and Irving don't give reports on Tuesday, they must give reports on Wednesday.
- Therefore, the answer is B: Helen and Nina.

Action: Answer("B")

- George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Wednesday.
- Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so they must give reports in the morning.
- If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. If Helen and Irving give reports on Tuesday, then George cannot give a report on Tuesday because there is only one report in the morning and one report in the afternoon. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
- If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday. If George gives a report on Tuesday, then there is only one report left for Wednesday, which cannot be given by Olivia or Robert. Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday.
- If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day as each other.
- Therefore, Nina must give a report on Tuesday, and Helen and Irving must both give reports on Wednesday if Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
- The only pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other are Helen and Nina.
- The answer is B: Helen and Nina.

  We know that Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports, so they must give their reports in the morning.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  So, if Nina gives a report on Tuesday or Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. If Nina doesn't give a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  We need to find a pair of students who must give reports on Wednesday if they give reports on the same day as each other.
  If George gives a report on Wednesday, then he won't be paired with anyone else.
  If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then she won't be paired with anyone else.
  If Robert gives a report on Monday, then he won't be paired with anyone else.
  If Lenore gives a report on Monday, then she won't be paired with anyone else.
  If Kyle gives a report on Monday, then he won't be paired with anyone else.
  So, the only possible pairs are Helen and Nina, Irving and Nina, and Nina and George.
  If Helen and Nina give reports on the same day, then they must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Irving and Nina give reports on the same day, then they must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina and George give reports on the same day, then they must give reports on Wednesday.

  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  There are only two reports given each day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving can give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot be paired with anyone on Wednesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report, so they can only give a report in the morning on Monday or Tuesday.
  Kyle can be paired with Nina on Monday or Wednesday, but not on Tuesday because George must give a report on Tuesday.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 17 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: If the watercolors lecture is third, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
- We know that the watercolors lecture is third, so we can create a schedule with watercolors in the third slot.
- We know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden's lecture must be in the first or second slot.
- We also know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley's lecture cannot be in the fourth slot.
- If Farley's lecture is not in the fourth slot, then Farley's lecture must be in the first or second slot.
- If Farley's lecture is in the first or second slot, and Holden's lecture is in the first or second slot, then Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be in the remaining slots.
- We know that Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture cannot be in the first slot, because Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
- Therefore, Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture must be in the second and fourth slots, but it is not clear which one is in which slot.
- We know that the oil paintings lecture must be after the watercolors lecture, so it must be in the fourth slot.
- We also know that the lithographs lecture must be after the oil paintings lecture, so it must be in the third or fourth slot.
- Therefore, E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture could be true.
Action: Answer("E")

  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be second.
  The order of the lectures is Farley, Holden, Watercolors, Oil paintings, and Lithographs.
  We can check which of the choices is consistent with this order.
  A: Farley gives the watercolors lecture. False, Farley gives the first lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. False, the oil paintings lecture is after the watercolors lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. True, Garcia gives the last lecture, which is on lithographs.
  D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture. False, Holden gives the second lecture, which is on watercolors.
  E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. True, Jiang gives the fourth lecture, which is on lithographs.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We are given that watercolors lecture is third.
  So, the order of lectures could be either Oil Paintings, Lithographs, Watercolors, and Sculptures or Oil Paintings, Watercolors, Lithographs, and Sculptures.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. So, Farley's lecture cannot be the watercolors lecture.

  Let's consider the options:
  A: If Farley gives the watercolors lecture, then Farley's lecture would be the first lecture. But, we know that watercolors lecture is the third lecture. So, this option cannot be true.
  B: If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Garcia's lecture would be the second lecture. But, we know that watercolors lecture is the third lecture. So, this option cannot be true.
  C: If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Garcia's lecture would be the fourth lecture. So, this option could be true for the order Oil Paintings, Lithographs, Watercolors, and Sculptures.
  D: If Holden gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture would be the fourth lecture. So, this option could be true for the order Oil Paintings, Watercolors, Lithographs, and Sculptures.
  E: If Jiang gives the lithographs lecture, then Jiang's lecture would be the last lecture. But, we know that watercolors lecture is the third lecture. So, this option cannot be true.

  Therefore, options C and D could be true.
Action: Answer("C or D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  According to the constraints, the oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  So, the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be the first one.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  So, Holden's lecture must be the second one.
  The sculptures lecture must be given by either Garcia or Holden.
  Therefore, it is possible that Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
  It is possible that Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  It is also possible that Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We are told that the watercolors lecture is third.
  Therefore, the oil paintings lecture must be first or second.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture must be first and the oil paintings lecture must be second.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture must be third, Garcia's lecture must be fourth, and Jiang's lecture must be second.
  The only option that fits this schedule is E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The watercolors lecture is third.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden must give the first lecture.
  Since Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture, Garcia and Jiang must give the oil paintings lecture and the sculptures lecture, but we don't know the order.
  Therefore, one of the following could be true:
    - Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. (B)
    - Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (C)
    - Holden gives the sculptures lecture. (D)
    - Jiang gives the lithographs lecture. (E)
  Farley cannot give the watercolors lecture since it is already given in the third lecture.
Action: Answer("BCDE")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the watercolors lecture is third.
  We know that the oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  So, the lithographs lecture must be the last one.
  We know that Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  So, Holden's lecture must be the first one.
  We know that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  So, Farley's lecture must be the second one and the oil paintings lecture must be the fourth one.
  From the above constraints, we can conclude that:
  Holden gives the sculptures lecture and Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the oil paintings lecture and the lithographs lecture must be the first and second lectures, but we don't know the order yet.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. This means Farley's lecture must be first, and the oil paintings lecture must be second.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. This means Holden's lecture must be third, and Garcia and Jiang's lectures must be fourth, but we don't know the order yet.
  The watercolors lecture is third, so the only option is that E: Jiang gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We have four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  There are four art historians: Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang.
  Each art historian gives a lecture on a different topic.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then the order of the lectures is either oil paintings, sculptures, watercolors, and lithographs or sculptures, oil paintings, watercolors, and lithographs.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, so Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, so Holden must give the sculptures lecture.
  If Garcia gives the oil paintings lecture, then Jiang must give the watercolors lecture, which contradicts the given information that the watercolors lecture is third. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, so Farley gives the sculptures lecture.
  The order of the lectures is Farley (sculptures), Holden (oil paintings), Jiang (watercolors), and Garcia (lithographs).
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then we can make the following deductions:
  The oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The watercolors lecture is third, so it must be either the sculptures or the lithographs lecture that is fourth.
  If the watercolors lecture is third, then Holden's lecture must be first or second.
  If Holden's lecture is first, then Garcia and Jiang's lectures would have to be second and fourth, but we don't know which one is which. This would mean that Farley's lecture would have to be the oil paintings lecture, which would contradict the first deduction that the oil paintings lecture must be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be first.
  If Holden's lecture is second, then Farley's lecture must be first. The oil paintings lecture must be third, and Garcia and Jiang's lectures must be second and fourth, but we don't know which one is which. This would mean that the lithographs lecture must be fourth. This scenario satisfies all the given constraints.
  Therefore, if the watercolors lecture is third, then Holden's lecture must be second, Farley's lecture must be first, the oil paintings lecture must be third, and the lithographs lecture must be fourth.
  The only choice that is consistent with this scenario is D: Holden gives the sculptures lecture.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 18 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following is an acceptable assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies?
Choices:
  A: Silva University: Gonzalez, Lai Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Mays
  B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai
  C: Silva University: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck Thorne University: Knutson, Lai, Mays
  D: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Lai
  E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai
Response 0:
Thought:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  There are only two ceremonies, so each ceremony must have at least two photographers.
  Let's go through each choice to see which one satisfies all of the constraints.
  
  A: Frost and Heideck are assigned together, but Lai and Mays are both assigned to Silva University. This violates the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony. This choice is incorrect.
  
  B: Knutson is assigned to Thorne University, which means that both Heideck and Mays must also be assigned to Thorne University. Lai is assigned to Silva University because Gonzalez is assigned there. This satisfies all of the constraints. This choice is correct.
  
  C: Frost and Heideck are assigned together, but Lai and Mays are both assigned to Silva University. This violates the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony. This choice is incorrect.
  
  D: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to Silva University, but Gonzalez and Lai are assigned to Thorne University. This violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne University. This choice is incorrect.
  
  E: Frost, Heideck, and Mays are assigned to Silva University, but Gonzalez and Knutson are assigned to Thorne University. This violates the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to Thorne University, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This choice is incorrect.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available, but not all have to be assigned.
  There must be at least two photographers assigned to each graduation ceremony.
  Based on these constraints, we can eliminate some of the answer choices that do not meet the requirements.
  Choice A does not satisfy the constraint that there must be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  Choice B does not satisfy the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one ceremony.
  Choice C satisfies all constraints and is a valid assignment.
  Choice D does not satisfy the constraint that Knutson cannot be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Choice E satisfies all constraints and is a valid assignment.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.

    - Gonzalez is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which means Lai must be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. This is not the case in this option.
    - This is not a valid assignment.
    
    Option C is the only valid assignment of photographers to the two graduation ceremonies.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
  Let's try to assign photographers to the ceremonies based on the given constraints.
  If Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva University, then Gonzalez cannot be assigned to Silva University and Lai must be assigned to Thorne University. Therefore, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to Thorne University. Then, based on the constraint, Knutson must also be assigned to Thorne University. 
  Now, we have Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays left to assign. If we assign Gonzalez to Thorne University, then Lai must be assigned to Silva University. In this case, we can assign Mays to either ceremony. 
  Therefore, the possible assignment of photographers is:
  Silva University: Lai, Mays
  Thorne University: Frost, Heideck, Gonzalez, Knutson
  The answer is E: Silva University: Frost, Heideck, Mays Thorne University: Gonzalez, Knutson, Lai
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  There are exactly six photographers available, and each ceremony must have at least two photographers.
  The only option that satisfies all of the constraints is option E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned with Heideck to one ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, then they must be assigned to different ceremonies.
  There must be at least two photographers assigned to each ceremony.
  A: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but there are no other photographers available for Silva University. This is not a valid assignment.
  B: Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, so Heideck and Mays must be assigned to Thorne. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne. This assignment satisfies all the constraints and is valid.
  C: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but there are no other photographers available for Silva University. This is not a valid assignment.
  D: Frost and Heideck must be assigned together, but Mays is also assigned to Silva. This is not a valid assignment.
  E: This assignment violates the constraint that Knutson must be assigned to Thorne if Heideck and Mays are not assigned to Thorne.
  The valid assignment is B: Silva University: Gonzalez, Mays Thorne University: Knutson, Lai.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Frost and Heideck must be assigned together to one of the ceremonies.
  Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Heideck and Mays are not assigned to it.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  We need to assign at least two photographers to each ceremony.
  A: Frost and Heideck are assigned together, but Mays is not assigned to the same ceremony as them. Lai is assigned to the same ceremony as Gonzalez, which violates the constraint that Lai and Mays cannot be assigned to the same ceremony if both are assigned. This is not an acceptable assignment.
  B: Knutson is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony if Heideck and Mays are not assigned to it. Gonzalez and Mays are assigned to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together. Lai is assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. This is a valid assignment.
  C: This assignment assigns all six photographers to the two ceremonies, which violates the constraint that not all photographers have to be assigned. This is not an acceptable assignment.
  D: This assignment violates the constraint that if Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. This is not an acceptable assignment.
  E: This assignment assigns Frost, Heideck, and Mays to the Silva University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that Frost and Heideck must be assigned together. Gonzalez, Knutson, and Lai are assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, which satisfies the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. This is a valid assignment.

  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies.
  There are two ceremonies and at least two photographers must be assigned to each.
  We can try out each option and see which one satisfies all the constraints.
  
Option A: Frost and Heideck must be together. Lai and Mays cannot be together. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva University, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne University. This leaves Knutson unassigned, which violates the constraint. So, this option is not valid.

Option B: Frost and Heideck must be together. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne. This satisfies all the constraints, so this option is valid.

Option C: Frost and Heideck must be together. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne. This leaves one photographer unassigned, which violates the constraint. So, this option is not valid.

Option D: Frost and Heideck must be together. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne. This satisfies all the constraints, so this option is valid.

Option E: Frost and Heideck must be together. If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned. Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, so Lai must be assigned to Thorne. This leaves one photographer unassigned, which violates the constraint. So, this option is not valid.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 19 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A panel of five scientists will be formed. The panelists will be selected from among three botanists—F, G, and H—three chemists—K, L, and M—and three zoologists—P, Q, and R. Selection is governed by the following conditions: The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected. If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
Question: If P is the only zoologist selected, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since P is already selected, R must also be selected if M is selected.
  If F and K cannot both be selected, then either F or K must be selected, but not both.
  Based on the above conditions, we can evaluate each of the answer choices.
  A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true, as F could be the selected botanist.
  B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true, as K could be the selected chemist.
  C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K. - This is not necessarily true, as L or M could be the selected chemist.
  D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected. - This is true, as only one botanist can be selected and if two chemists are selected, then the selected scientists will be two chemists and one botanist, which cannot be F.
  E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected. - This is not necessarily true, as K and L could be the selected chemists and F could be the selected botanist.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 1:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then a botanist and a chemist must be selected as well.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Since only P is selected, M cannot be selected.
  Therefore, K and L must be selected.
  If K is selected, G cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  If L is selected, F can be selected because there is no restriction between L and F.
  Therefore, (A) is true and (B), (C), (D), and (E) are false.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two types of scientists must be represented by the remaining four panelists.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then M cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected.
  Therefore, if K is selected, G can be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected.
  Therefore, if L is selected, F can be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K because K is the only chemist for whom we have a restriction that involves their selection.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F and G must be the botanists selected because H is the only remaining botanist and they cannot be selected with more than one botanist.
  Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
  The only statement that must be true based on the given information is that if exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then there must be only one chemist and one botanist selected.
  If K is selected, then F and G cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can still be selected.
  There is no restriction on which chemist should be selected.
  Therefore, (A) and (E) are not necessarily true.
  (B) is not true because F can still be selected if L is selected.
  (C) is not true because there is no restriction on which chemist should be selected.
  (D) is true because if exactly two chemists are selected, then they must be L and either K or M. If K is selected, then G cannot be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, so only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected, but P is the only zoologist selected, so M cannot be selected.
  Therefore, M is not selected, and K must be selected since there must be at least one chemist.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected because F and K cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, A must be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, either one botanist and one chemist are selected, or one botanist and two chemists are selected.
  If K is selected, then M cannot be selected, and if M is selected, then both P and R must be selected.
  If F is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, if P is the only zoologist selected, then F cannot be selected.
  The only statement that must be true is B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then at least one botanist and one chemist must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected because only one zoologist is selected.
  Therefore, either F or G must be selected as the botanist.
  If K is selected, then F must be selected since K and M cannot both be selected.
  Therefore, if K is selected, G cannot be selected because only one botanist can be selected.
  The answer is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to select five scientists from three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected.
  F and K cannot both be selected. K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then Q and R cannot be selected.
  The panel must include at least one botanist and one chemist.
  Let's consider each option.
  Option A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
    We cannot select both F and G as there can be at most one botanist if more than one botanist is selected. 
    If K is selected, F cannot be selected. 
    However, we cannot determine whether G can be selected or not if K is selected. 
    So, option A is not true.
  Option B: If L is selected, F cannot be selected.
    We cannot select both F and G as there can be at most one botanist if more than one botanist is selected. 
    If L is selected, K or M must also be selected. 
    However, we cannot determine whether F can be selected or not if L is selected. 
    So, option B is not true.
  Option C: If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K.
    If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K, L, or M. 
    However, we cannot determine whether K must be selected or not if exactly one chemist is selected. 
    So, option C is not true.
  Option D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
    If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be KL, KM, or LM. 
    If KL is selected, then F and G must also be selected, which violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
    If KM is selected, then P and R must also be selected. 
    If LM is selected, then P and Q must also be selected. 
    In all cases, F cannot be selected. 
    So, option D is true.
  Option E: If exactly two chemists are selected, G cannot be selected.
    If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be KL, KM, or LM. 
    If KL is selected, then F and G must also be selected, which violates the condition that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. 
    If KM is selected, then P and R must also be selected. 
    If LM is selected, then P and Q must also be selected. 
    In all cases, G can be selected. 
    So, option E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If exactly two chemists are selected, F cannot be selected.
Response 8:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then the other two scientists must be one botanist and one chemist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, only one botanist can be selected.
  If F is selected, then only one zoologist can be selected. Therefore, F cannot be selected.
  If G is selected, then K cannot be selected. Therefore, if K is selected, G cannot be selected.
  If L is selected, then K or M must be selected to satisfy the condition of selecting at least one chemist. Therefore, if L is selected, F cannot be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it can be either K or L. Therefore, if exactly one chemist is selected, it must not necessarily be K.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, they can be KL, KM, or LM. Therefore, if exactly two chemists are selected, F and G can be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected.
  Thus, the only option that must be true is A: If K is selected, G cannot be selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If P is the only zoologist selected, then at least one botanist and one chemist must be selected.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected. Therefore, at most one botanist is selected.
  If M is selected, then both P and R must be selected. Therefore, M cannot be selected.
  If K is selected, then F cannot be selected. Therefore, if K is selected, G can be selected.
  If L is selected, then F can be selected. Therefore, if L is selected, F can be selected.
  If exactly one chemist is selected, it must be K because K cannot be selected with F or M.
  If exactly two chemists are selected, then F cannot be selected because F cannot be selected with K or L. Therefore, D is true.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 20 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as which one of the following?
Choices:
  A: Kim
  B: Mahr
  C: Stuckey
  D: Tiao
  E: Udall
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in a sales zone, Parra should also work in the same sales zone.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, Tiao should work in Zone 2.
  If Udall cannot work in Zone 2, Udall should work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, Stuckey should work in Zone 3.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so there should be at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then there are at least 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which is not possible.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  The answer is C: Stuckey.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We need to find out which of the sales representatives cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Quinn works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 1 as well.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra cannot work in Zone 1. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  If Udall works in Zone 2, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 2. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
  If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 2 as well. This means that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 2 than in Zone 3. This contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, Stuckey cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra works in Zone 1, Quinn must also work in Zone 1.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall works in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Parra/Tiao work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn works in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Quinn works in Zone 2.
  If Quinn works in Zone 2, then he cannot work with Tiao.
  Therefore, Quinn CANNOT work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
  The answer is D: Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is not in Zone 2. Hence, Udall is in Zone 3.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, either Kim or Mahr is in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 3, then Udall is in Zone 3, which violates the condition that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey is not in Zone 3. Hence, Stuckey is in Zone 1 or Zone 2.
  If Stuckey is in Zone 1, then Parra, Quinn, and Stuckey are in Zone 1, which violates the condition that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Stuckey is in Zone 2.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3, which means either Kim or Mahr is in Zone 3. This implies that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim or Mahr.
  The answer is either A: Kim or B: Mahr.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which of the sales representatives Quinn cannot work with in the same sales zone.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Since Quinn is already working in a sales zone, we can eliminate Quinn from the answer choices.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall or Stuckey. Therefore, we can eliminate choices C and E.
  If Udall works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao or Stuckey. Therefore, we can eliminate choices D and B.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 and Udall must work in Zone 3. This means that Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim or Mahr. Therefore, the answer is A: Kim.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra is also in Zone 1.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Tiao is also in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall are also in Zone 3.
  So, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1 or Zone 2, then there will be at most two sales representatives in Quinn's zone.
  However, there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then there are at least three sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Since Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, Parra must also work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Udall works in Zone 1.
  If Udall works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2.
  Since Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, Stuckey must also work in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey work in Zone 1, and Tiao, Parra, and Quinn work in Zone 3.
  Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Parra, Stuckey, or Udall.
  Kim and Mahr are not mentioned in relation to Quinn.
  Tiao is mentioned in relation to Parra and Udall, but not to Quinn.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to find the person who cannot work in the same sales zone as Quinn.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Hence, Parra and Quinn must be in the same zone.
  Also, Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Hence, Stuckey and Udall must be in the same zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Parra must also be in Zone 1, and Tiao must be in Zone 3. But Tiao cannot be in Zone 3 as Udall is in Zone 2, so Quinn cannot be in Zone 1.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Udall must also be in Zone 2, and Tiao must be in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition of more sales representatives being in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Stuckey and Udall must also be in Zone 3. But this violates the condition of more sales representatives being in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Tiao.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We need to determine who Quinn cannot work with.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  It means that if Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is in Zone 3, and Quinn is in Zone 3.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  It means that if Tiao is in Zone 2, then Udall is in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then Tiao is in Zone 3.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Tiao is in Zone 2, then there are at least 3 representatives in Zone 3.
  If Udall is in Zone 2, then there are at least 4 representatives in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  It means that if Udall is in Zone 2, then Stuckey is in Zone 2.
  If Udall is in Zone 3, then Stuckey is in Zone 3.
  We need to find who Quinn cannot work with.
  If Parra is in Zone 1, then Quinn is also in Zone 1.
  If Quinn is in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1.
  If Parra is in Zone 3, then Quinn is also in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 3, then Tiao, Udall, and either Kim or Mahr cannot be in Zone 3.
  If Quinn is in Zone 2, then Tiao must be in Zone 3, and Udall must be in Zone 2 or 3. In both cases, Stuckey must be in Zone 2 or 3. Therefore, Kim and Mahr cannot be in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Quinn cannot work in the same sales zone as Kim.

  Julio's session must meet on an earlier day of the week than Olivia's, which means Julio's session is on Wednesday or Thursday.
  Lan and Olivia cannot lead sessions that meet on the same day, which means Lan's session is on Wednesday and Olivia's session is on Friday.
  Nessa must lead an afternoon session, which means Nessa's session is on Thursday or Friday.
  Since Kevin's session is on Thursday and Nessa's session is in the afternoon, Nessa's session is on Thursday afternoon.
  Therefore, the lab assistants who have not been assigned yet and could lead the Thursday afternoon session are Julio and Nessa.
  The answer is A: Julio, Nessa.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Kevin's session meets on the day before Nessa's session, then Kevin's session must be held on Wednesday afternoon, and Nessa's session must be held on Thursday afternoon.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 22 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, which one of the following is the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform?
Choices:
  A: two
  B: three
  C: four
  D: five
  E: six
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot two since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Wellspring can perform in slot three since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  We know that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  We know that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Zircon cannot perform in slot 3, which means that Wellspring cannot perform in slot 3 either.
  If Wellspring cannot perform in slot 3, then the earliest slot Wellspring can perform in is slot 4.
  Therefore, the answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign cannot perform in slot one or two.
  This means Yardsign must perform in slot three.
  Since Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon and Xpert, Wellspring cannot perform in slot five or six.
  This means Wellspring must perform in slot two or three.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot two.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Wellspring cannot perform in slot two or three because Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Yardsign performs in slot two, then Wellspring can perform in slot three because if Zircon performs in slot two, then Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  If Yardsign performs in slot three, then Wellspring can perform in slot four because if Zircon performs in slot three, then Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Wellspring.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one, two, or three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, if Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot one, and Xpert must perform in slot three.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in either slot one or two, and Xpert must perform in slot four.
  If Wellspring performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in either slot two or three, and Xpert must perform in slot five.
  If Wellspring performs in slot five, then Zircon must perform in slot three, and Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot two, and the answer is A: two.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Thus, Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, and since Yardsign is in slot 3, Wellspring and Zircon must be in slots 1 and 2 in some order.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 2.
  The answer is A: two.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  The order of the bands must be: Yardsign, Vegemite, Wellspring, Zircon, Uneasy, Xpert.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot 3.
  The answer is B: three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3 and Zircon must perform in slot 2.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  So, Xpert must perform in slot 6, which means that Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 4.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in either slot one, two, or three.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in either slot four, five, or six.
  Therefore, the possible slots for Yardsign are one, two, or three and the possible slots for Uneasy are four, five, or six.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot one, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Wellspring performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot one or two, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Wellspring performs in slot four, then Zircon must perform in slot two or three, which satisfies the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, the earliest slot in which Wellspring could perform is slot four.
  The answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Yardsign, then Yardsign must perform in slot 3.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  Therefore, Wellspring could perform in slot 2 or 3.
  If Wellspring performs in slot 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 1, and Vegemite must perform in slot 3. 
  However, this violates the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 3.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 23 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: f Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited
Choices:
  A: first
  B: second
  C: third
  D: fifth
  E: seventh
Response 0:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must be the third person to be recruited and Rovero must be the fourth person.
  Peters was recruited fourth, which means he cannot be Quinn or Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, which means White must be the seventh person.
  Therefore, Tao must be the first person to be recruited and Stanton must be the sixth person to be recruited.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must be the second, third, fourth, or fifth person to be recruited.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, we have the following order: Quinn, Rovero.
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so the order is: Quinn, Rovero, [unknown], Peters.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White. Therefore, the order is: Quinn, Rovero, [unknown], Villas, White, Peters.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Therefore, the order is: Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Villas, White, Stanton, Peters or Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, Stanton, Peters.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order is: Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, Peters. This is not possible since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited second, then the order is: Quinn, Stanton, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, Peters. This is not possible since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order is: Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Villas, White, Tao, Peters. This is not possible since Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order is: Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton, Tao, Peters. This is possible.
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order is: Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Tao, Peters, Stanton. This is not possible since Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, (unknown), (unknown), Villas, White.
  There are only two possible positions for Stanton in this order: third or fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment must be Peters, (unknown), Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, (unknown), Villas, White.
  However, this order violates the given information that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
  The answer is C: third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited fourth and Rovero must have been recruited fifth.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  If Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, then Stanton must have been recruited either first, second, fifth, sixth or seventh.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, Stanton cannot have been recruited fifth.
  The answer is D: fifth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, and the remaining four. Peters was recruited fourth, so the order would be Quinn, Peters, Rovero, and the remaining four.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before or after Tao, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Villas, White. This would mean that Stanton was recruited either third or fifth, which is not possible based on the given information.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third or fifth.
  The answer is either C: third or D: fifth.
Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment could be Peters, Tao, Villas, White, Quinn, Rovero, and Stanton.
  In this order, Stanton was recruited seventh.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited seventh.
  The answer is E: seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited in the first three positions and Rovero must have been recruited in the next three positions.
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters must have been recruited after Quinn and Rovero.
  Therefore, Stanton was recruited in either the first three positions or the last three positions.
  If Stanton was recruited in the last three positions, then he was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, Stanton must have been recruited in the first three positions.
  Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero and Quinn was recruited in the first three positions, then Rovero must have been recruited in the last three positions.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton must have been recruited in the first three positions.
  The only position that Stanton could not have been recruited in is the second position.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited second.
  The answer is B: second.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the seven accomplices is: 
  Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton is recruited third in this order.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton cannot have been recruited third.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of the two would be Quinn, Rovero.
  Therefore, the order of the seven accomplices would be Peters, Tao, Stanton, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, so he could not have been recruited second or fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Rovero.
  According to the information given, Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Rovero, and the other accomplices were recruited before Quinn or after Rovero.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the possible orders of recruitment are:
  1) Stanton, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?
  2) Stanton, ?, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?
  3) Stanton, ?, ?, Tao, ?, ?, ?
  4) Stanton, ?, ?, ?, Tao, ?, ?
  5) Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, Tao, ?
  6) Stanton, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, Tao
  In all possible orders, Villas cannot be recruited immediately before White because there are at least two accomplices in between them.
  Therefore, if Quinn was recruited immediately before Rovero, then Stanton CANNOT have been recruited third.
  The answer is C: third.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 24 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The percussionist performs the first solo.
  B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
  C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  E: The saxophonist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then there are two possible scenarios:
  1. percussionist performs first and saxophonist performs last.
  2. percussionist performs second and saxophonist performs last.
  If the percussionist performs first, then the saxophonist must perform after either the trumpeter or the keyboard player.
  If the percussionist performs second, then the saxophonist must perform after the keyboard player.
  The violinist must perform before the guitarist and the keyboard player must perform before the guitarist.
  Therefore, the correct answer must be related to the percussionist, saxophonist, and violinist.
  Looking at the choices, the only option related to these three members is choice C, which states that the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know there are six solos to be performed.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the percussionist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, then we know that the saxophonist's solo must be either the fifth or sixth solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist's solo must be either the first, second, or third solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist's solo must be the sixth solo, which contradicts the given restriction.
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist's solo must be the fifth solo.
  If the percussionist performs the third solo, then the saxophonist's solo must be the fifth solo.
  In either case, the violinist must perform a solo before the saxophonist does.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  The saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist.
  The keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first or second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist will perform after the trumpeter.
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist will perform after the percussionist and before the keyboard player.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo at some time after the trumpeter does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the first or second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the last solo. But this is not possible because the guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the second solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after the trumpeter does.
  The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  Therefore, the violinist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the trumpeter does.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the percussionist.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist, so the keyboard player cannot be the first or last to perform a solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the guitarist cannot be the fourth to perform a solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. So, the saxophonist cannot perform the first solo.
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist, then the percussionist must perform the first or second solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, the percussionist performs the second solo.
  The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does, so C is true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform either fourth, fifth, or sixth solo.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo, so the saxophonist must perform either fifth or sixth solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  If the saxophonist performs the fifth solo, then the keyboard player must perform the sixth solo.
  If the saxophonist performs the sixth solo, then the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform either first, second, or third solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo and the keyboard player must perform the sixth solo, which contradicts the fact that the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does.
  If the percussionist performs the third solo, then the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo and the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo, which does not violate any restrictions.
  If the percussionist performs the second solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo and the keyboard player must perform the sixth solo, which contradicts the fact that the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the percussionist performs the third solo.
  If the percussionist performs the third solo, then the saxophonist must perform the sixth solo and the keyboard player must perform the fifth solo.
  The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  Therefore, the violinist must perform either first, second, or fourth solo.
  If the violinist performs the first solo, then the percussionist must perform the third solo, which is true.
  If the violinist performs the second solo, then the percussionist must perform the third solo, which is true.
  If the violinist performs the fourth solo, then the saxophonist must perform the fifth solo and the keyboard player must perform the sixth solo, which contradicts the fact that the keyboard player performs a solo before the guitarist does.
  Therefore, the violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.
  The answer is C: The violinist performs a solo at some time before the saxophonist does.

Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Percussionist performs before the keyboard player.
  Keyboard player performs after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  Saxophonist performs after the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both.
  If the percussionist performs before the saxophonist, then the saxophonist cannot perform first or second solo.
  Therefore, the percussionist must perform the third solo.
  The violinist performs before the saxophonist, which means the violinist performs either the first or second solo.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The percussionist performs the second solo.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  From the restrictions, the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both. 
  If the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the saxophonist must perform a solo after the trumpeter does. 
  From the restrictions, the keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does.
  Therefore, if the percussionist performs a solo before the saxophonist does, then the percussionist must perform a solo before the keyboard player does. 
  This means the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo. 
  Choice A is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform the second solo.
  Choice B is possible since the percussionist must perform either the first or second solo.
  Choice C is not necessarily true because the violinist could perform a solo after the saxophonist does.
  Choice D is not necessarily true because the percussionist could perform a solo after the trumpeter does.
  Choice E is not necessarily true because the saxophonist could perform a solo after the percussionist does.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 25 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A naturalist will give five lectures, each on a different type of bird: oystercatchers, petrels, rails, sandpipers, or terns. The lectures must be given in either Gladwyn Hall or Howard Auditorium, in an order that meets the following conditions: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall
Response 0:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  If we place sandpipers fourth, oystercatchers fifth, and terns second, we can satisfy all of the given conditions.
  Therefore, the lecture on petrels must be given third, and it must be in Howard Auditorium.
  This means that the lecture on rails must be given first, and the lecture on sandpipers must be given fifth.
  From this, we can determine that the third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
  Therefore, the answer must be D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, which contradicts the given conditions.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on petrels is not the fourth lecture.
  The lecture on oystercatchers is not the first or fourth lecture.
  The lecture on rails is not mentioned in the conditions.
  Therefore, we need to check each choice against the given conditions to see which one is false.
  A: The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and it is not possible for the second lecture to be in Gladwyn Hall because exactly three lectures must be in Gladwyn Hall. This choice is true, so it cannot be the answer.
  B: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so it is not possible for the second and third lectures to be both in Howard Auditorium. This choice is true, so it cannot be the answer.
  C: The lecture on petrels is in Gladwyn Hall, and the lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels. Therefore, it is not possible for the second and fifth lectures to be both in Gladwyn Hall. This choice is true, so it cannot be the answer.
  D: The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium, so it is not possible for the third and fourth lectures to be both in Howard Auditorium. This choice is false, so it must be the answer.
  E: The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, so it is not possible for the third and fifth lectures to be both in Gladwyn Hall. This choice is true, so it cannot be the answer.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  We also know that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, so the second lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, which means the lecture on oystercatchers is not the fourth lecture.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall, so the lecture on petrels is not the first or fourth lecture.
  Therefore, the lecture on petrels is the third lecture, and the lecture on oystercatchers is the fifth lecture.
  Now we can eliminate some answer choices:
  - A and B are false because the first and second lectures are in Gladwyn Hall and Howard Auditorium, respectively.
  - D is false because the third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
  This leaves us with C and E as possible options.
  If the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the fifth lecture (oystercatchers) must also be in Gladwyn Hall, which would make C true and E false.
  If the fifth lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the third lecture (rails) must be in Howard Auditorium, which would make E true and C false.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E, but we cannot determine which one is false without more information.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  By following the given conditions, we can determine the order of the lectures and where they will be held.
  We can then check which of the options violates the established conditions.
  If an option contradicts any of the given conditions, then it must be false.
  
Action: Answer("C")  
Explanation: 
  The order of the lectures and where they will be held is:
  Lecture 1: Gladwyn Hall (must be in Gladwyn Hall)
  Lecture 2: Gladwyn Hall (must be in Gladwyn Hall)
  Lecture 3: Howard Auditorium (must be in Howard Auditorium)
  Lecture 4: Howard Auditorium (must be in Howard Auditorium)
  Lecture 5: Gladwyn Hall (must be in Gladwyn Hall)
  Therefore, the second and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall. 
  Option C contradicts the established conditions and must be false.
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, so the second lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall as well.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on petrels is not the first lecture, so it must be the third lecture.
  Therefore, the lecture on terns is the second lecture and it is also in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on oystercatchers must be the fifth lecture in Howard Auditorium.
  This means that the lecture on rails must be the third lecture in Gladwyn Hall.
  So, we have the following order: Gladwyn Hall, Gladwyn Hall, Gladwyn Hall, Howard Auditorium, Howard Auditorium
  Given this order, we can check each statement.
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is true.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is false.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is false.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. This is false.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. This is false.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall. (Condition 1)
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. (Condition 2)
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. (Condition 3)
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. (Condition 4)
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. (Condition 5)
  If the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, then the fifth lecture must be in Howard Auditorium. (Condition 2)
  If the third lecture is in Howard Auditorium, then the fifth lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall. (Condition 2)
  Therefore, the third and fifth lectures cannot both be in Gladwyn Hall or both be in Howard Auditorium. (Condition 2)
  Thus, the false statement is E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  We also know that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall, which means that two lectures must be in Howard Auditorium.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  From the above conditions, we can create a schedule of the lectures.
  Gladwyn Hall: oystercatchers, rails, petrels
  Howard Auditorium: sandpipers, terns
  Now, we can evaluate each statement:
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - This is false because the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall, and the second lecture is on oystercatchers, which is in Howard Auditorium.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. - This is false because the second lecture is on oystercatchers, which is in Howard Auditorium, and the third lecture is on rails, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - This is false because the second lecture is on oystercatchers, which is in Howard Auditorium, and the fifth lecture is on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. - This is false because the third lecture is on rails, which is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. - This is true because the third lecture is on rails, which is in Gladwyn Hall, and the fifth lecture is on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
Response 7:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  If the second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium, then the third lecture cannot be on rails because the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium. This would mean that the third lecture is on oystercatchers, which contradicts the condition that the lecture on oystercatchers is after the lecture on sandpipers.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the second Gladwyn Hall lecture is either on petrels or rails.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium and the lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers. Therefore, the third lecture is on oystercatchers, and the fifth lecture is on petrels.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns must be either the first or second lecture. 
  If the lecture on terns is the first lecture, then the lecture on rails must be the second lecture, which contradicts the fact that exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall. Therefore, the lecture on terns must be the second lecture and the lecture on rails must be the first lecture.
  Thus, the only possible order is: 
  Gladwyn Hall: rails, terns, petrels
  Howard Auditorium: sandpipers, oystercatchers
  
  A: The first and second lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. False, because the first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the second lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. False, because the second lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  C: The second and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. False, because the second lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fifth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium. False, because the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  E: The third and fifth lectures are both in Gladwyn Hall. False, because the third lecture is in Gladwyn Hall and the fifth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: The third and fourth lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.
Response 9:
Thought:
  The first lecture is in Gladwyn Hall.
  The fourth lecture is in Howard Auditorium.
  Exactly three of the lectures are in Gladwyn Hall.
  The lecture on sandpipers is in Howard Auditorium and is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, which is in Gladwyn Hall.
  If we place the lectures in order, we get: Gladwyn, X, Y, Howard, Z. 
  X and Y must be Gladwyn lectures, and Z must be a Howard lecture.
  The lecture on sandpipers is given earlier than the lecture on oystercatchers, so Z must be the sandpiper lecture and Y must be the oystercatcher lecture.
  The lecture on terns is given earlier than the lecture on petrels, and the petrel lecture must be in Gladwyn Hall, so X must be the tern lecture.
  Therefore, the second and third lectures cannot both be in Howard Auditorium, so the answer is B: The second and third lectures are both in Howard Auditorium.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 26 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, which one of the following could also be displayed on wall 2?
Choices:
  A: Franz's oil
  B: Greene's watercolor
  C: Greene's oil
  D: Hidalgo's watercolor
  E: Isaacs's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 as no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, if Franz's oil is on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be on wall 1.
  If Greene's watercolor is on wall 1, then Greene's oil cannot be on wall 1 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it. Therefore, Greene's oil must be on wall 3 or 4.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 3.
  So, if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil, which must be in the lower position.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then we know that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors.
  We also know that no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, so Hidalgo's watercolor must be on one of the other walls.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Hidalgo's oil is on wall 2, we know that neither Franz's oil nor Greene's watercolor can be on wall 2.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on either wall 1, 2, or 3.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 1, then wall 3 must have either Franz's oil or Greene's oil, which is not possible because no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 3, then wall 1 must have either Franz's oil or Greene's oil, which is not possible because no wall can have only one student's work displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 2.
  The only option that could also be displayed on wall 2 is D: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's other painting, the watercolor, must be displayed on another wall.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  Therefore, the other painting displayed on wall 2 cannot belong to Hidalgo.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Franz's oil and Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 2 as well.
  The answer is B: Greene's watercolor.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on another wall.
  Since no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, there must be at least one oil painting displayed with Hidalgo's watercolor.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's watercolor.
  Since no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it, there must be at least one painting by another student displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so one of the paintings displayed on wall 2 must be an oil painting.
  No wall can have only one student's work displayed on it, so the other painting displayed on wall 2 cannot be Hidalgo's other painting.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be displayed on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Since Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible option is A: Franz's oil.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors. Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be on wall 2. 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Franz's oil cannot be on wall 2 because no wall can have the work of only one student displayed on it. Therefore, Greene's oil must be on wall 2.
  So, Isaacs's watercolor and Greene's oil are displayed on wall 2 with Hidalgo's oil.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  Wall 2 has two paintings, one in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  Wall 2 cannot have both of Franz's paintings or both of Isaacs's paintings.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  If Greene's oil is on wall 2, then Wall 2 will have only the work of one student displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil cannot be on wall 2.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is on wall 2, then Wall 2 will have only the work of one student displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is Isaacs's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so there must be one oil painting and one watercolor painting on wall 2.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so there must be paintings from two different students on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, so neither of their paintings can be on wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is not on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor cannot be on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible option is Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, the paintings on wall 2 must be by Greene and Hidalgo.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or 3, and Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 3 or 4.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on either wall 1 or 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Greene's oil.
  The answer is C: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on wall 2, then Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 2.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's other painting must be an oil.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so the other oil on wall 2 must be painted by a student other than Hidalgo.
  We know that wall 4 has Isaacs's oil in the lower position, so wall 4 cannot have Hidalgo's oil in either position.
  Since Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, then Greene's oil cannot be displayed on wall 2 because Franz's oil is not on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible painting that could also be displayed on wall 2 is Franz's oil.

  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
  D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
  E: Bay 5 is holding machinery.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then livestock must be in bay 3 or bay 4, and produce must be in bay 4 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5, and livestock must be in bay 3.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then produce must be in bay 5, and livestock must be in bay 3.
  If bay 5 is holding grain, then grain must be in bay 5, and livestock must be in bay 4 or bay 3, which is not possible.
  If bay 5 is holding machinery, then livestock must be in bay 4 or bay 3, and produce must be in bay 4, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding produce must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
  If bay holding produce is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is bay 6.
  If bay holding produce is bay 6, then the bay holding livestock is bay 5.
  If bay holding produce is bay 5, then the bay holding fuel is bay 1.
  If bay holding produce is bay 6, then the bay holding fuel is bay 1 or bay 2.
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding textiles, then the bay holding textiles must be bay 4.
  If bay holding textiles is bay 4, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 5 and the bay holding produce must be bay 6.
  Therefore, bay 4 cannot be holding fuel, grain, or machinery.
  The only choice that violates this is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 5.
  If bay 5 is holding grain, then bay 4 must be holding textiles, which contradicts the given condition that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, the bay holding produce must be either bay 5 or bay 6.
  If the bay holding produce is in bay 6, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 5, and the bay holding textiles must be in bay 4.
  If the bay holding produce is in bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 6, and the bay holding textiles must be in bay 4.
  Therefore, bay 4 must be holding textiles.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then bay 3 must be holding grain, and bay 2 must be holding fuel.
  Therefore, A is possible, B is possible, C is not possible, D is possible, and E is possible.
  The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  If the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 3, then the bay holding produce must be bay 4 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3 or 5. This means that Bay 5 cannot hold machinery because it is holding textiles which is next to produce. This eliminates choice E.
  If the bay holding livestock is bay 4, then the bay holding produce must be bay 5 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 3. This means that Bay 4 cannot hold produce because it is holding something else. This eliminates choice B.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Bay 4 is holding produce.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 3 or bay 4.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be in bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 3. Therefore, the bay holding grain must be in bay 1, and the bay holding fuel must be in bay 6.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding livestock must be in bay 3. Therefore, the bay holding grain must be in bay 2, and the bay holding fuel must be in bay 6.
  Bay 2 cannot be holding fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, A is not true.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding grain must be in bay 1. Therefore, D is true.
  If bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding grain must be in bay 2. Therefore, D is not true.
  Bay 5 cannot be holding machinery because each bay is holding a different type of cargo. Therefore, E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Bay 4 is holding textiles.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the order of the bays would be: livestock, produce, textiles.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, the bay holding produce must be bay 5 and the bay holding livestock must be bay 4.
  Bay 4 is holding textiles, and bay 6 is holding grain.
  Therefore, bay 5 cannot be holding grain or machinery.
  So, the answer is D: Bay 5 is holding grain.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding textiles.
  We also know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, the bay holding produce must be bay 5 and the bay holding textiles must be bay 4.
  So, the bay holding livestock must be bay 6 and the bay holding grain must be bay 3.
  From this information, we can determine which statements are possible or not.
  A: Bay 2 cannot be holding fuel since fuel is lower than produce, which is in bay 5.
  B: Bay 4 can hold produce since it is next to the bay holding livestock, which is bay 6.
  C: Bay 4 is holding textiles, which is true.
  D: Bay 5 is holding machinery, which is true.
  E: Bay 5 cannot be holding grain since grain is in bay 3.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles can only be bay 3 or bay 5.
  If Bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding textiles must be bay 5.
  If Bay 4 is holding textiles, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 3, and the bay holding produce must be bay 2 or bay 5.
  Bay 2 cannot be holding fuel because the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay 5 cannot be holding grain because the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay 5 cannot be holding machinery because there is no restriction on where machinery can be held.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Bay 2 is holding fuel.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If the bay holding produce is next to the bay holding livestock, then the bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or 5.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or 5 as well.
  Bay 4 is adjacent to both bay 3 and 5, so it cannot hold either produce or textiles.
  Therefore, C cannot be true.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then which one of the following could be true of this evening's schedule?
Choices:
  A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
  B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
  C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
  D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
  E: The western begins at 8 P.M.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film because of the first condition.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on either screen 1 or 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so they cannot be both on screen 1 or both on screen 2.
  Therefore, the mystery must be shown on screen 3.
  The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 because the romance is not shown on that screen.
  Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 1.
  The western must begin before the sci-fi film, so the western cannot begin at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the western must begin at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or screen 2, and the sci-fi film must be shown on the other screen.
  The only choice that satisfies these conditions is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:

  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 1 and screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1.
  If the western begins at 7 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 9 P.M.
  If the western begins at 9 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film must be shown on screen 1 and the mystery must be shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the mystery begins at 7 P.M.
  The only option that could be true of this evening's schedule is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on screen 1 or 2 because the sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 if the mystery is shown on screen 2.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film, so the western cannot begin at 8 P.M. if the horror film is shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, and the romance is shown on screen 2. This means that the horror film must be shown on screen 3, and the mystery must begin at 9 P.M.
  The only option that could be true is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must begin before the sci-fi film.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, and the romance is not shown on screen 2, so either the horror film or the mystery is shown on screen 2, and the other is shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  Therefore, if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the western must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2, and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  If the western is shown on screen 1 or screen 2, then the horror film or the mystery must be shown on screen 3, and the other must be shown on the remaining screen.
  If the western is shown on screen 3, then the horror film or the mystery must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2, and the other must be shown on the remaining screen.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only option that could be true is that the western begins at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film begins at 9 P.M., both on either screen 1 or screen 2.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible screens for them to be shown on are screens 1 or 2.
  The western must begin before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 and the mystery must be shown on screen 2. This means the romance cannot be shown on screen 2, but it also cannot be shown on screen 3 because screen 3 only shows one movie, at 8 P.M. Therefore, the romance must be shown on screen 1, which means the mystery must be shown on screen 2. This leaves the horror film to be shown on screen 2. 
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1 and the mystery must be shown on screen 1. This means the romance cannot be shown on screen 1, but it also cannot be shown on screen 3 because screen 3 only shows one movie, at 8 P.M. Therefore, the romance must be shown on screen 2, which means the horror film must be shown on screen 1. This leaves the mystery to be shown on screen 1.
  So, in both cases, the horror film is shown on screen 2. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: The horror film is shown on screen 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the horror film must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 or 2 because it must be shown on a different screen than the horror film.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or 3.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 or 2, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 or 1, respectively.
  If the western begins at 7 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 9 P.M. and be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  If the western begins at 9 P.M., then the sci-fi film must begin at 7 P.M. and be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  If the western begins at 8 P.M., then the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they cannot be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The western begins before the horror film, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 1 with the western.
  Therefore, the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 with the sci-fi film.
  Therefore, the horror film must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  If the horror film is shown on screen 3, then the romance must be shown on screen 1.
  If the horror film is shown on screen 1, then the mystery must be shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M.
  The only option that could be true is D: The sci-fi film begins at 7 P.M.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then we can deduce that the western starts at 7 P.M. and the sci-fi film starts at 9 P.M. 
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on the same screen as the western and the sci-fi film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, so it cannot be shown with the horror film.
  Therefore, the western must be shown on screen 1 or screen 2 with the sci-fi film.
  If the western is shown on screen 1 with the sci-fi film, then the horror film must be shown on screen 2 and the mystery on screen 3.
  If the western is shown on screen 2 with the sci-fi film, then the horror film and the mystery must be shown on screen 1.
  So, the mystery begins at 7 P.M. and the horror film begins at 9 P.M.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 or screen 3.
  Therefore, the only possible true statement is that the romance is shown on screen 3.
  The answer is C: The romance is shown on screen 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then they can be shown on screen 1 or screen 2.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, therefore the romance is shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. If the horror film is shown on screen 2, then the mystery is shown on screen 1 or 3.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3, therefore the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1 if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 2.
  The mystery begins at 9 P.M. if the western and the sci-fi film are shown on screen 1.
  Therefore, the answer is B: The mystery begins at 9 P.M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, so the horror film cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 if it is shown at 7 P.M.
  The western begins before the horror film, so it must be shown at 7 P.M. on either screen 1 or 2.
  If the western and the sci-fi film are shown on the same screen, then they must be shown on screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, if the western and the sci-fi film are scheduled to be shown on the same screen, then the only possible schedule is: western at 7 P.M. and sci-fi at 9 P.M. on screen 1 or 2, and horror film at 7 P.M. or 9 P.M. and mystery at the other time on the other screen.
  This means that the mystery cannot begin at 9 P.M. because it must be shown at the other time on the other screen.
  The romance is shown on screen 1 if it is shown at 7 P.M., so it cannot be shown on screen 3.
  The sci-fi film cannot begin at 7 P.M. because the western must be shown at that time.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in either slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  From the above, we know that Yardsign could perform in slot one.
  If Yardsign performs in slot one, then Vegemite and Wellspring must perform in slot two and slot three, but Zircon cannot perform in slot four because Zircon must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot five or slot six, and Uneasy must perform in the remaining slot.
  The complete and accurate list of bands that could perform in slot one is Vegemite, Wellspring, and Yardsign.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 30 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: I and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then we know that L is not on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, O must be on the top shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the top or middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  If F is placed on the same shelf as M, then F and M must be on the middle or top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf if F and M are on the middle shelf, or on the middle or top shelf if F and M are on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, G and H must be on the bottom shelf if L is on the middle shelf, or on the bottom or middle shelf if L is on the bottom shelf.
  If G and H are on the same shelf, then the answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be placed on the bottom shelf, and L must be placed on the top or middle shelf.
  If L is on the top shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which violates the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If L is on the middle shelf, then F and M must be on the middle shelf, which violates the condition that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, L must be on the bottom shelf, and H must be on the middle shelf.
  G can be on any shelf, as long as it is not on the same shelf as F or K.
  Therefore, none of the choices must be true.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, it means that L is placed on the top shelf or the middle shelf and H is placed on the middle shelf or the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so L cannot be placed on the middle shelf.
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, L cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, L is placed on the bottom shelf and H is placed on the middle shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, K and O must be placed on the top shelf, and F, G, H, I, L, and M must be placed on the bottom and middle shelves.
  None of the choices are directly deducible from this information.
  However, we can eliminate choices A, B, and D because they involve G or H being placed on the same shelf as another book, and we don't know where G or H are placed.
  We can also eliminate choice E because we already know that K and O are placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, I is placed on the middle shelf, so H cannot be on the same shelf as I.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so H cannot be on the same shelf as F or M.
  Therefore, H must be on the top shelf with G, and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf with O.
  If L is on the middle shelf, then K and F must be on the bottom shelf, which means G and M must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine the relationship between L and H and then find the answer choice that must be true based on that relationship.
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf because that would mean H is on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, L must be on the middle shelf or the top shelf.
  If L is on the middle shelf, then O must be on the top shelf, which means K is on the middle shelf and F, G, H, I, and M are on the bottom shelf. In this case, none of the answer choices must be true.
  If L is on the top shelf, then O must also be on the top shelf, which means K is on the middle shelf and F, G, H, I, and M are on the bottom shelf. In this case, answer choice E must be true because K and O cannot be on the same shelf as each other.
  Therefore, the answer is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf and F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Since L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed, we can assume that L is placed on the top shelf and H is placed on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If H is placed on the middle shelf, then I must be placed on the top shelf and K must be placed on the bottom shelf. This means that O must also be placed on the bottom shelf, which contradicts the fact that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. Therefore, H must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, and K is placed on a higher shelf than F, we can assume that K and M are placed on the top shelf and F is placed on the middle shelf.
  This leaves us with G and O to be placed on the middle shelf. Since O is placed on a higher shelf than L, G must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  The answer is B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then there are two possibilities:
  1. L is on the top shelf and H is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  2. L is on the middle shelf and H is on the bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, we know that I is placed on the middle shelf, and F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, if L is on the top shelf, then K and O must be on the middle and bottom shelves in some order. This would mean that G and H must be on the same shelf as each other, as there are no other books left to place on the remaining shelf. If L is on the middle shelf, then K and O must be on the top and bottom shelves in some order. This would mean that H and M must be on the same shelf as each other, as there are no other books left to place on the remaining shelf. Therefore, the answer is either B: G and H are placed on the same shelf as each other or C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  Since more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, H must be placed on the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf. Therefore, L must be placed on the bottom shelf. 
  F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F must be placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F. Therefore, K must be placed on the top shelf and O must be placed on the middle shelf.
  None of the conditions indicate anything about the placement of G and H, so we cannot determine whether they are placed on the same shelf or not.
  None of the conditions indicate anything about the placement of H and M, so we cannot determine whether they are placed on the same shelf or not.
  None of the conditions indicate anything about the placement of I and G, so we cannot determine whether they are placed on the same shelf or not.
  K and O are placed on different shelves. Therefore, E is not true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: F and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, O must be on the bottom shelf.
  Since O is on the bottom shelf, K must be on the top or middle shelf.
  Since K is on a higher shelf than F, then F cannot be on the top shelf.
  Since F is placed on the same shelf as M, then M cannot be on the top shelf.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, then G and H must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, if L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then H must be on the middle shelf and L must be on the top shelf.
  The only choice that is true based on this information is C: H and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If L is placed on a shelf higher than the shelf H is placed on, then L cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Since more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, L must be on the middle shelf.
  According to the given conditions, I is placed on the middle shelf, so H must be placed on the top shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so both of them cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Since K is placed on a higher shelf than F, K cannot be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Therefore, K must be on the top shelf, and O must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  Based on the above analysis, the only answer that must be true is E: K and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 31 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An administrator must assign parking spaces to six new employees: Robertson, Souza, Togowa, Vaughn, Xu, and Young. Each of the six employees must be assigned one of the following parking spaces: #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. No two employees can be assigned the same parking space. The following rules govern the assignment of parking spaces: Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa. Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
Question: The assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Souza is assigned parking space #1.
  B: Young is assigned parking space #2.
  C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
  D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4. If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6. Xu must be assigned parking space #6, but this contradicts the fact that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, who must be assigned parking space #5. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #5. Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2. This satisfies all the rules and constraints. Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #3, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
- The assignment of parking spaces is fully and uniquely determined if we can determine the parking space assigned to each of the six employees based on the given rules.
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4, so the parking space for Robertson is determined.
- Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young, so Young must be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
- Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa, so Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza, so Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #3, #4, #5, or #6.
- We don't know where Vaughn should be assigned.
- If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #5 or #6, which violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
- If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, and Robertson must be assigned parking space #3 or #4, which violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young.
- If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, Robertson must be assigned parking space #2, Young must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #4 or #6. This satisfies all the given rules and determines the parking space for each employee.
- Therefore, the answer is C: Vaughn is assigned parking space #3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #3, or #4.
  If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #2, #3, #4, or #5.
  If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Togowa must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #4, or #5.
  If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, #3, #4, or #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  None of the above scenarios contradicts any of the given rules.
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #1.
  The answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Young cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6 and Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza must be assigned parking space #2.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #1.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, Souza must be assigned parking space #3, Vaughn must be assigned parking space #2, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #4.
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #1.
  The answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:

  We know that Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Young can be assigned are #2, #3, #4, #5, or #6. However, this violates the rule that Robertson must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Young. Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #1.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then the only parking spaces that Young can be assigned are #3, #4, #5, or #6. The only parking spaces that Togowa can be assigned are #1 or #2. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Xu can be assigned are #3, #4, or #5. However, this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #3, #4, and #5 to be assigned to Souza, Vaughn, and Young, but we don't know which employee gets which space. Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #2.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then the only parking spaces that Young can be assigned are #4, #5, or #6. The only parking spaces that Togowa can be assigned are #1 or #2. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Xu can be assigned are #3, #4, or #5. However, this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #4 and #5 to be assigned to Souza and Vaughn, but we don't know which employee gets which space. Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #3.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then the only parking spaces that Young can be assigned are #5 or #6. The only parking spaces that Togowa can be assigned are #1 or #2. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Xu can be assigned are #3, #4, or #5. However, this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.

Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #5, then the only parking space that Young can be assigned is #6. The only parking spaces that Togowa can be assigned are #1 or #2. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Xu can be assigned are #3, #4, or #5. However, this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #3 and #4 to be assigned to Souza and Vaughn, but we don't know which employee gets which space. Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #5.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #6, then the only parking space that Young can be assigned is #5 or #6. The only parking spaces that Togowa can be assigned are #1 or #2. If Togowa is assigned parking space #1, then the only parking spaces that Xu can be assigned are #3, #4, or #5. However, this violates the rule that Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza. Therefore, Togowa must be assigned parking space #2, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. This leaves parking spaces #3 and #4 to be assigned to Souza and Vaughn, but we don't know which employee gets which space. Thus, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #6.
  Therefore, the only choice that leads to a unique and fully determined assignment of parking spaces is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
- Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, Togowa must be assigned parking space #5, and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, Togowa must be assigned parking space #4, Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Souza must be assigned parking space #6.
- If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #3, Xu must be assigned parking space #4, Souza must be assigned parking space #5, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6. 
- Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #4, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined.
- The answer is D: Robertson is assigned parking space #4.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The rules are:
  1. Young > Togowa
  2. Xu > Souza
  3. Robertson > Young
  4. Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 and Xu must be assigned parking space #5. Then, Togowa and Souza must be assigned parking spaces #6 and #2, respectively. This means Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined.
  
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6. Then, Togowa and Souza must be assigned parking spaces #1 and #2, respectively. This means Vaughn must be assigned parking space #3. Therefore, if Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined.
  
  If Souza is assigned parking space #1, then Xu must be assigned parking space #6, which means Young must be assigned parking space #5. However, this violates rule 2, which says Xu > Souza. Therefore, if Souza is assigned parking space #1, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined.
  
  If Young is assigned parking space #2, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which means Young cannot be assigned parking space #2. Therefore, if Young is assigned parking space #2, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined.
  
  If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, which means Young must be assigned parking space #4. However, this violates rule 3, which says Robertson > Young. Therefore, if Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined.
  
  If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, which means Robertson must be assigned parking space #1. However, this violates rule 3, which says Robertson > Young. Therefore, if Xu is assigned parking space #5, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is not fully and uniquely determined.
  
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #6 and Xu cannot be assigned parking space #1 or #2.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 or #5, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, or #5, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, #3, #4, or #5, and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Xu is assigned parking space #5, then Souza must be assigned parking space #1 or #2, and Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, or #6. 
  None of the other choices provide enough information to fully and uniquely determine the assignment of parking spaces.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Xu is assigned parking space #5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  Therefore, Robertson cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  Young must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Togowa.
  Therefore, Togowa cannot be assigned parking space #6.
  Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, Souza cannot be assigned parking space #5 or #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 or #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, #4, or #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, #3, #4, or #5 and Xu can be assigned parking space #6 or #5.
  If Vaughn is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4 or #5 and Xu must be assigned parking space #6.
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Robertson must be assigned parking space #1, #2, #3, or #4.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #4, then Young must be assigned parking space #5 and Togowa must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3, then we can start making some deductions.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #1, then Young must be assigned parking space #2, Togowa must be assigned parking space #3, Souza must be assigned parking space #4, Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #2, then Young must be assigned parking space #3, Togowa must be assigned parking space #4, Xu must be assigned parking space #5, and Vaughn must be assigned parking space #6. Souza cannot be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  If Robertson is assigned parking space #3, then Young must be assigned parking space #4, Togowa must be assigned parking space #5, Xu must be assigned parking space #6, and Souza cannot be assigned any of the remaining parking spaces because Xu must be assigned a higher-numbered parking space than Souza.
  Therefore, the assignment of parking spaces to each of the new employees is fully and uniquely determined if Robertson is assigned parking space #1, #2, or #3.

Thought:
  If both G and H are selected, then we need to consider the possibilities of the third scientist type.
  If we select a botanist as the third scientist, then at most one zoologist can be selected.
  If we select a chemist as the third scientist, then we cannot select K and M together.
  If we select a zoologist as the third scientist, then if M is selected, P and R must both be selected.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices A and E because they do not account for these conditions.
  If we select F as the third scientist, then we can select either one zoologist or one chemist. 
  If we select K as the third scientist, then we can select either one botanist or one zoologist.
  If we select M as the third scientist, then we must select both P and R.
  Therefore, the panel must include either F or else K.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 33 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3?
Choices:
  A: Kim, Mahr
  B: Kim, Tiao
  C: Parra, Quinn
  D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall
  E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) work in Zone 1 and Tiao or Udall (but not both) work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 3, and Tiao cannot work in both Zone 2 and Zone 3.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  That leaves us with only one possibility, which is that Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, so they cannot be in different sales zones.
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Tiao cannot be in Zone 1, which means Tiao must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  We know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so it is likely that Tiao is in Zone 3.
  If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Udall cannot be in Zone 3 because Udall and Stuckey work in the same sales zone.
  If Tiao is in Zone 3, then Parra must be in Zone 2.
  If Parra is in Zone 2, then Quinn must also be in Zone 2 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Kim and Mahr are the only two sales representatives left, and they must be in Zone 3 because we know there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of sales representatives working in Zone 3 is Kim and Mahr.
  The answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  Since there are exactly seven sales representatives, and we know that some of them are already assigned to Zones 1 and 2, we can use process of elimination to determine which answer choice is correct.
  
  A: Kim and Mahr cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  B: Kim cannot work in Zone 3 because there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  C: Parra and Quinn cannot work in Zone 3 because they work in the same sales zone as each other, and we are looking for representatives working in Zone 3.
  D: This is a possibility. Tiao works in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, which could be Zone 3. Therefore, D is a possible answer.
  E: This is also a possibility. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, which could be Zone 3. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, which could also be Zone 3. Therefore, E is a possible answer.
  
  Since both D and E are possible answers, we cannot determine which one is correct without additional information.
  
Action: Answer("D or E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  From the given choices, only D and E include Tiao and Udall, which are the only two sales representatives that work in either Zone 2 or Zone 1.
  Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, the only possible answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  However, we also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall cannot both work in Zone 2.
  So, Stuckey and Udall must both work in Zone 3.
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn must both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  However, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn cannot both work in Zone 2, since if they did, there would be no sales representative to work in Zone 1.
  So, Parra and Quinn must both work in Zone 3.
  That means there are three sales representatives working in Zone 3: Stuckey, Udall, and either Parra or Quinn.
  Therefore, the only choice that could be a complete and accurate list of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, we can eliminate options A, B, and C because they do not have enough representatives to satisfy the condition that there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Option D has three representatives, which is less than the four representatives required by the condition.
  Option E has all four representatives, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall, who work in the same sales zone as each other, which satisfies the condition.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  We can use the fact that Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone to eliminate some options.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, then we need at least one more person to work in Zone 3 to satisfy the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, so they cannot both work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that works is D: Stuckey, Tiao, Udall.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than Zone 2. 
  We also know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  Therefore, Stuckey and Udall must be in Zone 3. 
  We also know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. 
  Since Udall is in Zone 3, Tiao must be in Zone 2, and Parra must be in Zone 1. 
  We also know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. 
  Therefore, Quinn must be in Zone 1 with Parra. 
  That leaves Kim and Mahr to work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim, Mahr.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  There are seven sales representatives in total.
  If Parra or Tiao is in Zone 1, then the other must be in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If Tiao or Udall is in Zone 2, then the other must be in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of sales representatives in Zone 3 is Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, and Udall.
  The answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We also know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We can eliminate choices A and B because Kim is not working in Zone 3.
  We can eliminate choice C because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  We are left with choices D and E.
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they cannot both be in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is E: Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Udall.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 34 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then which one of the following could be false?
Choices:
  A: At least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days.
  B: At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  E: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  We know from the conditions that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday as well.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday.
  If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then we can conclude that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, which means statement D is not false.
  We can also conclude that at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so statement A is not false.
  We know that the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, so exactly one batch of cookies is not made on Monday, which means statement C is false.
  We also know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so exactly one batch of cookies is not made on Friday, which means statement E is false.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E.
Action: Answer("C or E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday).
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
    1. oatmeal 1st batch and sugar 3rd batch
    2. peanut butter 1st batch and oatmeal 3rd batch
    3. sugar 1st batch and peanut butter 3rd batch
  We can use these combinations to determine which statement could be false.
  If we have combination 1, then we know that sugar cookies are made on Monday, which means that statement C is false.
  If we have combination 2, then we know that oatmeal cookies are made on Wednesday, which means that statement B is true.
  If we have combination 3, then we know that peanut butter cookies are made on Friday, which means that statement E is false.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  Let's try to use the given information to determine which statement could be false.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible combinations are:
    1. Sugar cookies' first batch is made on Thursday and Oatmeal cookies' third batch is made on Thursday.
    2. Oatmeal cookies' first batch is made on Monday and Peanut Butter cookies' third batch is made on Monday.
  In the first combination, we have batches made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Therefore, statement A is true.
  In the second combination, we have batches made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday. Therefore, statement E is true.
  Since both combinations have batches made on Wednesday, statement B is also true.
  If the second combination is true, then statement C is false because there are two batches made on Monday.
  If the first combination is true, then statement D is false because there is only one batch made on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be false if one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the possible scenarios are:
    1. Oatmeal's first batch is made on Tuesday and Sugar's third batch is made on Tuesday. Peanut butter's first batch is made on Monday, second batch is made on Tuesday, and third batch is made on Wednesday.
    2. Oatmeal's first batch is made on Wednesday and Sugar's third batch is made on Wednesday. Peanut butter's first batch is made on Monday, second batch is made on Wednesday, and third batch is made on Thursday.
    3. Oatmeal's first batch is made on Thursday and Sugar's third batch is made on Thursday. Peanut butter's first batch is made on Monday, second batch is made on Tuesday, and third batch is made on Thursday.
  From the scenarios above, we can see that the statement that could be false is statement C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. If scenario 3 happens, then two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  There are three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  Each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of cookies must be either the first batch of oatmeal cookies or the second batch of sugar cookies.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the third batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday as well. This satisfies all the conditions.
  If the second batch of sugar cookies is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the third batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Wednesday. Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, the answer must be one of the choices that could be false if the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch or if the second batch of sugar cookies is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch.
  Choice C states that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. This is true in both cases, so it cannot be false.
  Choice D states that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday. This is true in both cases, so it cannot be false.
  Choice E states that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday. This is true in both cases, so it cannot be false.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  There are three kinds of cookies: oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the following are true:
    - The first batch of one kind of cookie is made on the same day as the third batch of another kind of cookie.
    - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Monday because the first batch of one kind of cookie is being made on that day.
    - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is being made on that day.
    - The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the third batch of sugar cookies is being made on that day.
    - Therefore, the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday or Friday.
    - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Thursday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This would mean that exactly one batch of cookies is made on Tuesday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday and Friday respectively. So, A, C, and E are true, and B and D are false.
    - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday. This would mean that exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Wednesday. So, A, B, and E are true, and C and D are false.
  Therefore, either B or D could be false, depending on which day the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies and the third batch of oatmeal cookies are made on the same day.
  There are only three batches of each kind of cookie made each week.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must also be made on Wednesday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the only possibility is that the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, the same day as the third batch of sugar cookies.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Friday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday. 
  Therefore, the only choice that could be false is D: Exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies is not made on Monday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday and there are no other batches of sugar cookies.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies is not made on Monday or Thursday.
  If the first batch of one kind of cookie is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday as well.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Thursday, and exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then it is possible that at least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday.
  The other statements are true based on the given conditions.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The first batch of the peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  The first batch of the sugar cookies is made on Wednesday or Thursday.
  If one kind of cookie's first batch is made on the same day as another kind of cookie's third batch, then:
  - If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the third batch of the peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of the sugar cookies is made on Wednesday.
  - If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the third batch of the peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of the sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  In either case, at least one batch of cookies is made on each of the five days, so A is true.
  At least two batches of cookies are made on Wednesday because the first batch of the sugar cookies is made on Wednesday, and it's the only day that has at least two batches of different kinds of cookies, so B is true.
  If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of the peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, and the first batch of the sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. In this case, exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so C is false. If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then exactly one batch of cookies is made on Friday, so E is false.
  If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so D is false. If the first batch of the oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then exactly two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, so D is true.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one batch of cookies is made on Monday. 
Action: Answer("C")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 35 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: If Taylor is not a project member, which one of the following workers must be a project member?
Choices:
  A: Quinn
  B: Ruiz
  C: Verma
  D: Wells
  E: Xue
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then one of them must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the project leader.
  The answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is not a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, Quinn must be a project member and the project leader.
  The answer is A: Quinn.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  This means that there are only two possible scenarios: 
    1) Wells is a project member and neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
    2) Quinn or Ruiz is the project leader and either Quinn or Ruiz is a project member.
  In scenario 1, Wells must be a project member.
  In scenario 2, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: Wells or A: Quinn.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member either.
  If Verma is not a project member, then Ruiz must be the project leader if Quinn is not a project member.
  However, Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Therefore, Verma must be a project member if Taylor is not a project member.
  The answer is C: Verma.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  Therefore, if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Wells is a project member, then the project leader must be either Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is the project leader, then either Verma or Ruiz must be a project member.
  If Verma cannot be a project member, then Ruiz must be a project member.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then Wells and Ruiz must be project members, and Ruiz must be the project leader.
  The answer is B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  Since exactly three workers will be selected, and Taylor and Smith are not project members, then we can select three workers from the remaining five: Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Quinn or Ruiz are project members, then one of them must be the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Verma must be a project member if Taylor is not.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith cannot be a project member.
  This means that the only way to satisfy the constraint of Smith and Taylor is for neither of them to be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  This means that either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and the leader.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Taylor is not a project member, then the project members are Smith and two of Quinn, Ruiz, Verma, Wells, and Xue.
  If Verma is a project member, then neither Wells nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  Therefore, Verma cannot be a project member.
  If Quinn is a project member, then he must be the project leader.
  If Ruiz is a project member, then he must be the project leader.
  Therefore, either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  The answer is A: Quinn or B: Ruiz.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is not a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Wells cannot be a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  Therefore, Quinn must be a project member and the project leader.
  The third project member can be Xue.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Xue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Taylor is not a project member, then Smith is also not a project member.
  Therefore, Wells cannot be a project member because if Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  This means that either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member and also the project leader.
  Since Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be the project leader.
  The third project member will be the remaining worker from the group: Smith, Verma, or Xue.
  Therefore, the worker who must be a project member is either Quinn or Ruiz.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Zircon must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, which means Xpert must perform in slot 6.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it must perform in slot 4 or 5.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot 4 or 5, and Wellspring performs in slot 2.
  The only statement that must be true is that Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  The answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  If Vegemite performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 4, 5, or 6.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  If Zircon performs in slot 4, 5, or 6, then Wellspring must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  If Wellspring performs in slot 1 or 2, then Zircon must perform in slot 2 or 3, which contradicts the constraint that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot 4 or 5, and Wellspring must perform in slot 1 or 2.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 6, then Yardsign must perform in slot 1 or 2, which contradicts the constraint that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot 4 or 5, and Yardsign must perform in slot 1, 2, or 3.
  If Uneasy performs in slot 4, then Xpert must perform in slot 5 or 6, which contradicts the constraint that Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.

  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  If Xpert performs in slot five, then Uneasy performs in slot four, five, or six.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then Yardsign performs in slot one or two.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Vegemite performs in slot three, then slots one and two must be filled by Yardsign and Wellspring in some order.
  According to the constraints, Zircon must perform in a later slot than Vegemite, which means Zircon must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Uneasy must perform in one of the last three slots, so it must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Xpert must perform in a later slot than Wellspring and Zircon, so it must perform in slot six.

  The only option that satisfies this condition is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
If Vegemite performs in slot three, then the order of the bands can be arranged as follows:
Slot 1: Yardsign or Wellspring
Slot 2: Yardsign or Wellspring
Slot 3: Vegemite
Slot 4: Uneasy or Wellspring or Zircon
Slot 5: Uneasy or Wellspring or Zircon
Slot 6: Xpert or Uneasy or Zircon

Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Xpert can only be in slot 6.

Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Therefore, Uneasy can only be in slot 4 or 5.

Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots. Therefore, Yardsign can only be in slot 1 or 2.

If Uneasy is in slot 4, then Wellspring and Zircon must be in slots 1 and 2 in some order, which means that Vegemite cannot be in slot 3. Therefore, Uneasy must be in slot 5, which means that Wellspring and Zircon must be in slots 1 and 2 in some order. Thus, Vegemite is in slot 3, and Wellspring and Zircon are in slots 1 and 2 in some order.

Therefore, the answer is B: Wellspring performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.

Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited first.
  B: Rovero was recruited third.
  C: Stanton was recruited second.
  D: Tao was recruited sixth.
  E: Villas was recruited sixth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order of recruitment is: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment cannot be [Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, Stanton, Peters, Tao].
  If Quinn was recruited first, the order of recruitment would be [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Peters, Tao], which is valid.
  If Rovero was recruited third, the order of recruitment would be [Villas, White, Rovero, Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Tao], which is valid.
  If Stanton was recruited second, the order of recruitment would be [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Quinn], which is not valid.
  If Tao was recruited sixth, the order of recruitment would be [Villas, White, Rovero, Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Tao], which is valid.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, the order of recruitment would be [Rovero, Tao, Stanton, Peters, Quinn, White, Villas], which is not valid.
  Therefore, the possible order of recruitment is [Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Peters, Tao].
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the possible order of the recruitment could be:
  1. Quinn
  2. Villas
  3. White
  4. Rovero
  5. Peters
  6. Stanton
  7. Tao
  Therefore, Stanton could have been recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment must be Quinn, Stanton, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, Peters.
  According to this order, Quinn was recruited first, Rovero was recruited fifth, Stanton was recruited second, Tao was recruited sixth, and Villas was recruited third.
  Therefore, the statement "Rovero was recruited third" could be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth and each accomplice was recruited one at a time.
  If Peters was fourth, then Quinn couldn't have been recruited first because Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then White and Rovero must be recruited before Tao.
  Therefore, Tao couldn't have been recruited sixth because Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  If Tao wasn't recruited sixth, then Tao must be recruited fifth or seventh.
  If Tao was recruited seventh, then Stanton would have to be recruited sixth, but Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Tao must be recruited fifth.
  If Tao was recruited fifth, then Rovero must be recruited fourth and White must be recruited third.
  If White was recruited third, then Villas must be recruited second and Quinn must be recruited first.
  Therefore, Quinn was recruited first.
  The answer is A: Quinn was recruited first.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  White was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment is: Quinn, Stanton, Peters, Villas, White, Rovero, and Tao.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited last.
  Therefore, Tao was recruited sixth.
  The only option that fits this order of recruitment is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so we can use that as a reference point.
  Since Villas was recruited immediately before White, and White was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Villas must have been recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Since Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn must have been recruited earlier than Villas.
  We know that Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so there are two possibilities: either Stanton was recruited before Tao, or Stanton was recruited after Tao.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must have been recruited sixth and Rovero must have been recruited fifth.
  Therefore, the only possible order is: Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Peters.
  From this order, we can see that the answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters, a second person, a third person, Stanton, a fifth person, Villas, White, and Tao.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas is fifth and White is sixth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn is either first or second, and Rovero is either second or third.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao is seventh.
  So the order of recruitment is Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Stanton, Villas, White, and Tao.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so we can place him in the middle of the sequence.
  If Villas was recruited immediately before White, then Peters must have been recruited immediately before Villas.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn cannot be first or second.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be sixth.
  This means that Stanton was recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately before Tao, then he must be seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited immediately after Tao, then Tao must be fifth and Stanton must be second.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Stanton was recruited second.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment is Peters - X - X - X - X - X - X, where X represents the remaining accomplices.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Tao must be recruited either second, third, sixth, or seventh.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be one of the first two recruits.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White must be recruited either sixth or seventh.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then Tao must be recruited seventh and Rovero sixth.
  Therefore, the order of recruitment is Peters - Quinn - Villas - White - Rovero - Stanton - Tao.
  The answer is D: Tao was recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  If White was recruited earlier than Rovero and if Rovero was recruited earlier than Tao, then the order must be: [Villas, White, Rovero, Tao, ...].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be first.
  Therefore, the possible order is: [Peters, Stanton, Quinn, Villas, White, Rovero, Tao].
  Therefore, Tao could have been recruited sixth.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 38 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: Which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf?
Choices:
  A: F, M
  B: F, H, M
  C: G, H, K
  D: F, G, M, O
  E: G, H, L, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, the top shelf will have two books, and the bottom shelf will have either three or four books.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. So, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M. So, if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. So, K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. So, if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  Let's check each option:
  A: F and M are on the same shelf. We also need at least one more book on the bottom shelf, so this option is not possible.
  B: F and M are on the bottom shelf, which is possible. H is also on the bottom shelf, which means that the top shelf must have G, I, and K, and the middle shelf must have L and O. This option satisfies all the conditions, so it is possible.
  C: None of these books are on the bottom shelf, so this option is not possible.
  D: F and M are on the bottom shelf, which is possible. G and O are also on the bottom shelf, which means that the top shelf must have H, I, and K, and L cannot be placed on any shelf. This option violates the condition that L must be placed on a shelf, so it is not possible.
  E: M is not on the bottom shelf, so this option is not possible.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. So, the bottom shelf has at least three books.
  We know that F and M are placed on the same shelf. So, they both cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. So, I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F. So, K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L. So, O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is G, H, and L.
  The answer is E: G, H, L, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, which means the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  Since I is placed on the middle shelf, I cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, which means K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, which means O cannot be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, which means if F is on the bottom shelf, M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to find the list that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  From the given conditions, we know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, at least three books must be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is also on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf if L is also on the bottom shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  From the given choices, the only list that meets these conditions is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that there are more books on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, then M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf if F is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is on a higher shelf than L, so if O is on the bottom shelf, then L must also be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that there are at least two books on each shelf, so the remaining books (G and H) must be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the top shelf must have two books and the bottom shelf must have at least three books.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F and M must be on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top or middle shelf, and F and M must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so I cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top or middle shelf, and L must be on the bottom shelf.
  From these conditions, we can deduce that the only possible list of books placed on the bottom shelf is F, H, M.
  Therefore, the answer is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We do not know where G, H, I, K, or L are placed.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, the only option that could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf is B: F, H, M.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is on the bottom shelf, M must also be on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is A: F, M.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  The middle shelf has at least two books, one of which is I.
  K is on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  O is on a higher shelf than L, so O cannot be on the bottom shelf.
  F and M are on the same shelf, so they cannot be on different shelves.
  Therefore, F and M must be on the same shelf as I.
  Because more books are on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, at least three books must be on the bottom shelf.
  G and L are not on the bottom shelf.
  H is not on the same shelf as F or M.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of books on the bottom shelf is F, G, and M.
  The answer is D: F, G, M, O.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We don't know the exact number of books on each shelf, so we need to try each answer choice and see if it fits the conditions.
  If we choose A, we would have only 2 books on the bottom shelf and that would mean that there are only 2 books on the top shelf, which contradicts the given condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If we choose B, we would have 3 books on the bottom shelf and that would mean that there are only 2 books on the top shelf, which again contradicts the given condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If we choose C, we would have 3 books on the top shelf, which contradicts the given condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If we choose D, we could have 3 books on the bottom shelf and 2 on the top shelf, which satisfies the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Also, F and M are on the same shelf, and O is on a higher shelf than L, and K is on a higher shelf than F. So, D could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the bottom shelf.
  If we choose E, we would have 4 books on the top shelf, which contradicts the given condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, the answer is D: F, G, M, O.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 39 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: Which one of the following, if substituted for the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring, would have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks?
Choices:
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The given condition is "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring".
  This means that if M is published in the fall, N cannot be published in the fall.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the given condition.
  Option A talks about L and M, which is not relevant to M and N.
  Option B talks about N and P, which is not relevant to M and N.
  Option C talks about M and P, which is not relevant to N.
  Option D talks about N and M, which is the same as the given condition but with the order of N and M switched.
  Option E talks about O and N, which is not relevant to M and N.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The given condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If this condition is substituted with another condition, then it should have the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
  Option A talks about L and M, which is not relevant to the given condition.
  Option B talks about N and P, which is also not relevant to the given condition.
  Option C talks about M and P, which is also not relevant to the given condition.
  Option D talks about N and M, which is the same as the given condition but with the seasons reversed.
  Option E talks about O and N, which is not relevant to the given condition.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The given condition is: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that if M is published in the fall, N cannot be published in the fall. Therefore, N must be published in the spring.
  So, we need to find the option that says if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Option A says that if L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This doesn't have the same effect as the given condition.
  Option B says that if N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This doesn't have the same effect as the given condition.
  Option C says that if M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This doesn't have the same effect as the given condition.
  Option D says that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the opposite effect as the given condition.
  Option E says that if O is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This doesn't have the same effect as the given condition.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The condition is that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If we substitute this condition with another condition, it should have the same effect on the publication of the cookbooks.
  Let's consider each choice one by one.
  A: If L is published in the fall, M must be published in the spring. This condition does not affect the publication of N, so it is not equivalent to the original condition.
  B: If N is published in the fall, P must also be published in the fall. This condition does not involve M, so it is not equivalent to the original condition.
  C: If M is published in the spring, P must be published in the fall. This condition does not involve N, so it is not equivalent to the original condition.
  D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This condition is equivalent to the original condition, as it determines the season for both N and M.
  E: If 0 is published in the spring, N must also be published in the spring. This condition does not involve M, so it is not equivalent to the original condition.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The original condition is: If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
  The condition in choice A is irrelevant to M and N, so it cannot have the same effect.
  The condition in choice B is about N and P, so it cannot have the same effect.
  The condition in choice C is about M and P, so it cannot have the same effect.
  The condition in choice D is the opposite of the original condition, so it cannot have the same effect.
  The condition in choice E is about O and N, so it cannot have the same effect.
  None of the choices have the same effect as the original condition.
  Therefore, the answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find a substitution for the condition "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring" that would have the same effect on the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
  If M is in the fall, N cannot be in the fall, so N must be in the spring.
  This means that if M is in the spring, N could be in either the fall or the spring.
  Therefore, we need to find a condition that would force M to be in the spring, so that we can determine when N will be published.
  Answer choice A does not help us determine when M will be published.
  Answer choice B does not help us determine when M will be published.
  Answer choice C does not help us determine when M will be published.
  Answer choice D helps us determine when M will be published. If N is in the spring, then M must also be in the spring.
  Answer choice E does not help us determine when M will be published.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The original condition states that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that if N is published in the fall, M cannot be published in the fall.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We need to find the answer choice that has the same effect in determining the schedule for the publication of the cookbooks as the condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. This means that M and N cannot be published in the same season.
  Answer choice D states that if N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring. This has the same effect as the original condition, which means that N and M cannot be published in the same season.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The original condition is "If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring."
  This means that if M is not published in the fall, then N can be published in either fall or spring.
  We need to find a condition that has the same effect as the original condition.
  Choice A is not relevant to the relationship between M and N.
  Choice B is not relevant to the relationship between M and N, K, O, and P.
  Choice C is not relevant to the relationship between M and N.
  Choice D has the same structure as the original condition, but the roles of M and N are reversed.
  Choice E is not relevant to the relationship between M and N, K, O, and P.
  Therefore, the answer is D: If N is published in the spring, M must also be published in the spring.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find an answer choice that has the same effect as the given condition that if M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  This means that if M is published in the spring, N must be published in the fall.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 40 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, which one of the following must be displayed on wall 1?
Choices:
  A: Franz's watercolor
  B: Greene's oil
  C: Greene's watercolor
  D: Hidalgo's oil
  E: Hidalgo's watercolor
Response 0:
Thought: 
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 3 or 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so the upper position of wall 1 must be an oil painting.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it, so the lower position of wall 1 cannot be an oil painting by Franz or Isaacs.
  Therefore, the only option for the lower position of wall 1 is Hidalgo's watercolor.
  The answer is E: Hidalgo's watercolor.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  We know that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  We know that Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, we can conclude that Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is on wall 4 and Isaacs's watercolor is on wall 2.
  Franz's oil is on wall 3.
  Therefore, Franz's watercolor cannot be on wall 3 or wall 2.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's watercolor cannot be on wall 3.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4 in the lower position.
  Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 2.
  Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on either wall 1 or wall 2 because no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  This is because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Greene's watercolor.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3.
  If Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Franz's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 3, so it must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed, so if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 3 and his oil on wall 1.
  If Hidalgo's paintings are not displayed on wall 4, then both of his paintings must be displayed on wall 1 or wall 3.
  If both of Hidalgo's paintings are displayed on wall 1, then wall 4 would have only watercolors. This is not allowed, so Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on wall 3.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on wall 3 and his watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then we know:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. So, Greene's watercolor is displayed on wall 3.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. So, Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. So, we know that there must be an oil painting on wall 2.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. So, neither Franz's nor Isaacs's painting can be on wall 2.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. So, there must be paintings by at least two different students on wall 2.
  Therefore, the only possible painting to be displayed on wall 1 is Hidalgo's oil painting.
  The answer is D: Hidalgo's oil.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2 and Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 1 or 4.
  However, Isaacs's oil cannot be displayed on wall 1 because no wall can have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's oil must be displayed on wall 4, which means that Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of wall 2.
  Since no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, Greene's oil must be displayed on wall 1.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Greene's oil.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1 or wall 2.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed on wall 2, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  This is because Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, if Franz's oil is displayed on wall 3, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on wall 1.
  The answer is C: Greene's watercolor.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 41 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
  C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  D: Olivia gives a report on Monday.
  E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then one of them must give a report on Monday and the other two must give reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday since it would violate the condition of Helen and Irving giving reports on the next day.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina and Robert must give reports on Monday and Wednesday, respectively.
  If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report, so Helen must give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Nina gives a report on Tuesday, George gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday. 
  The only option that could be true is C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, and neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then one of them has to give a report in the morning and the other in the afternoon.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then it is possible that Nina gives a report on Monday and George and Robert give reports on Wednesday.
  This means that Helen could give a report on Wednesday, so A is a possible answer.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day (after the day she gives a report) Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then the remaining students who will give reports are Helen, Irving, and Kyle.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, but there are no available slots. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday, and Kyle must give a report on Monday. So, this is possible.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday, but Kyle has to give a report on Tuesday, which is not possible. Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  If Robert gives a report on Monday, then Kyle must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday. But, as we saw earlier, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Robert cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Olivia gives a report on Monday, then Kyle must give a report on Tuesday, and Nina must give a report on Wednesday. But, as we saw earlier, Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday. Therefore, Olivia cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Helen gives a report on Wednesday, then Kyle must give a report on Monday, and Nina must give a report on Tuesday. But, as we saw earlier, Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday. Therefore, Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
  The answer is C: Nina gives a report on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  Only two reports can be given per day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not need to give reports.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then only one report can be given on that day.
  If Robert gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then only one report can be given on the day he gives a report.
  If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then two reports can be given on that day.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  Therefore, the only possible day Nina can give a report is Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  Therefore, Helen can give a report on Wednesday.
  The only person left to give a report is Lenore.
  Therefore, Robert must give a report on Wednesday.
  The answer is E: Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then only the following scenarios are possible:
    1. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
    2. George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
    3. Nina gives a report on Tuesday, George gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
    4. Nina gives a report on Tuesday, George gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
  From the above scenarios, we can see that Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday, as that would mean George and Robert would have to give reports on the same day, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is Scenario 1, where George gives a report on Tuesday, Nina gives a report on Monday, and Robert gives a report on Wednesday.
  From this scenario, we can see that Helen cannot give a report on Wednesday, as there are already two reports scheduled for that day.
  Olivia cannot give a report on Monday, as neither she nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Nina gives a report on Monday.
  The answer is B: Nina gives a report on Monday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  If George gives a report on Tuesday, then Nina cannot give a report on Tuesday.
  If Robert gives a report on Wednesday, then Olivia cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Nina gives a report on Wednesday, George gives a report on Tuesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.
  From this, we can conclude that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
- If George, Nina, and Robert give reports, then George gives a report on Tuesday. 
- If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday. 
- Since George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days, then Robert cannot give a report on Tuesday. 
- If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday, and George cannot give a report. 
- Therefore, if George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, the only option that could be true is that Helen gives a report on Wednesday. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then only one of them can give a report each day.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday, which is impossible since George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the next day.
  Therefore, it is possible that Nina gives a report on Wednesday and George and Robert give reports on Monday.
  This means that Helen can give a report on Monday or Wednesday and Olivia can give a report on Tuesday or Wednesday.
  Therefore, it is possible that Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
  The answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  We know that if Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  We need to determine which of the answer choices is possible given the above conditions and the additional information that George, Nina, and Robert give reports on different days from one another.
  We can eliminate option B since Nina cannot give a report on Monday if George is giving a report on Tuesday.
  We can eliminate option D since Olivia cannot give an afternoon report.
  We can eliminate option E since Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  We are left with options A and C as possibilities.
  If Nina gives a report on Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Wednesday. This means George cannot give a report on Wednesday, so he must give a report on Monday. Robert would then have to give a report on Monday as well, leaving Olivia to give a report on Wednesday. This satisfies the conditions and the answer is A: Helen gives a report on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We also know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If George, Nina, and Robert give reports and they do so on different days from one another, then:
    - George must give his report on Tuesday.
    - Nina must give her report on Monday or Wednesday.
    - Robert must give his report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on Tuesday. But this is not possible because George must give his report on Tuesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must not give reports on Tuesday. This means that Helen must give a report on Wednesday. Robert cannot give a report on Wednesday because neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. Therefore, Robert must give his report on Monday. This means that Nina gives a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that Nina gives a report on Wednesday, Helen gives a report on Wednesday, and Robert gives a report on Monday.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 42 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: The selection for the project is completely determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
  D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
  E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  We need to find the statement that would completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which means Smith cannot be a project member. So, this statement does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means Taylor cannot be a project member. So, this statement does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot infer any constraints from this statement. So, this statement does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there are no constraints on the selection. Any three workers can be selected, and any one of them can be the project leader. So, this statement completely determines the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then if Wells is a project member, we cannot select Ruiz or Verma. But, we can still select Quinn, Smith, Taylor, or Xue. So, this statement does not completely determine the selection.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then that person must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  We need to determine which combination of workers can be selected that satisfies these constraints.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we could select Taylor, Wells, and Xue. However, we do not know who the project leader would be.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we could select Smith, Wells, and Xue. However, we do not know who the project leader would be.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we could select Smith, Taylor, and Wells. Since neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we know that the project leader must be Ruiz.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we could select Smith, Taylor, and Xue. Since neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we know that the project leader must be Quinn.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we could select Smith, Taylor, and Xue. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we know that the project leader must be Quinn.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Quinn nor Xue is selected. 
  The answer is C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Exactly three workers will be selected for the project and one of them will be the project leader.
  We can try to eliminate some options to see which one will lead to a unique selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected, which means Wells cannot be selected since neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member if Wells is selected. This leaves us with only two possible members, Xue and Verma, but we cannot determine the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which means we can only select Wells, Ruiz, and Xue. In this case, we can determine that Ruiz will be the project leader.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we must select Quinn, Ruiz, and Smith. In this case, we can determine that Quinn will be the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we must select Quinn, Smith, and Xue. In this case, we can determine that Quinn will be the project leader.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can select Quinn, Smith, and Xue. In this case, we can determine that Quinn will be the project leader.
  Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which answer choice will completely determine the selection for the project.
  The constraints are: 
  1. Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  2. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  3. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Let's consider each answer choice:
  A. If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor can't be selected. This means constraint 2 is violated. Therefore, this answer choice does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  B. If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith can't be selected. This means constraint 2 is satisfied. However, we don't know if Quinn or Ruiz will be selected as a project member. Therefore, this answer choice does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  C. If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still don't know who will lead the project. Therefore, this answer choice does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  D. If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then constraint 3 is satisfied. However, we still don't know if Quinn or Taylor will be selected as a project member. Therefore, this answer choice does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  E. If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then constraint 3 is satisfied. Also, Quinn or Ruiz can only be a project member if leading the project. This means that if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then Quinn must be the project leader and a project member. In this case, Taylor must also be a project member. Therefore, the selection for the project is completely determined if neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected.
  The answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which of the options will result in a completely determined selection for the project.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor must not be selected. This leaves us with four workers to choose from to fill three spots, but we cannot determine who will be the project leader. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith must not be selected. This leaves us with five workers to choose from to fill three spots, but we cannot determine who will be the project leader. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we are left with five workers to choose from to fill three spots. We know that Quinn cannot be a project member unless he or she is the project leader, so the only way to select only three workers is to choose Quinn as the leader and select two other workers from the remaining four. Therefore, this option completely determines the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we are left with five workers to choose from to fill three spots. We know that if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. However, if neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then there is no constraint on which workers can be selected. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we are left with five workers to choose from to fill three spots. We know that if Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. However, if Wells is not selected, then there is no constraint on which workers can be selected. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection.
  The only option that completely determines the selection is C: Neither Quinn nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Quinn or Ruiz is selected, then they must be the project leader.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  Exactly three workers will be selected.
  Exactly one of the selected workers will be the project leader.
  We can try each option and see whether the selection is completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then we can have Ruiz as the project leader and Wells and Xue as members. However, we can also have Taylor as the project leader and Wells and Smith as members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then we can have Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Xue as members. However, we can also have Wells as the project leader and Smith and Taylor as members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then we can have Ruiz as the project leader and Smith and Wells as members. However, we can also have Wells as the project leader and Smith and Verma as members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we cannot have Quinn or Ruiz as the project leader. Therefore, the project leader must be Smith, and the other member must be Taylor. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we can have Quinn as the project leader and Smith and Xue as members. However, we can also have Taylor as the project leader and Smith and Wells as members. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  The only option that leads to a completely determined selection is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Let's try to eliminate options to find the correct answer.
  (A) If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, we still have three candidates left: Ruiz, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue. We don't know who will be the project leader. So, this option is not completely determined.
  (B) If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, we still have three candidates left: Ruiz, Smith, Verma, Wells, and Xue. We don't know who will be the project leader. So, this option is not completely determined.
  (C) If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we still have three candidates left: Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells. We don't know who will be the project leader. So, this option is not completely determined.
  (D) If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we still have three candidates left: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. We don't know who will be the project leader. So, this option is not completely determined.
  (E) If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we are left with three candidates: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We know that neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected. So, the three remaining candidates are the only ones who can be selected. Also, since Quinn and Ruiz can only be selected if leading the project, and only one project leader can be selected, we know that neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be selected. Therefore, there are only two possible choices for the project members: Smith, Taylor, and Wells or Smith, Taylor, and Xue. In either case, we know that Smith must be a project member, and one of the other two members must be the project leader. So, the selection is completely determined.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected. Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement will lead to a completely determined selection for the project.
  We can use the constraints to eliminate some possibilities.
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which violates the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be." So, A is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be selected, which violates the constraint "If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be." So, B is not the answer.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, we cannot determine the project leader. So, C is not the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, we can determine the project leader to be Smith, and the third member to be Xue. So, D could be the answer.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, we can determine the project leader to be Quinn, and the third member to be Taylor. So, E could be the answer.
  We need to check which of D and E is the correct answer.
  If Wells is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected, and we can determine the project leader to be Smith, and the third member to be Xue. So, the answer is D: Neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then Taylor cannot be selected, which means that Smith cannot be a project member. This violates the constraint.
  If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then Smith cannot be a project member, which means that Taylor cannot be a project member. This violates the constraint.
  If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then there are only five remaining workers, and three of them must be selected. Since neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, this means that Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Wells are the only options. However, we still need to determine who will be the project leader, and this depends on whether Quinn or Ruiz is selected as a project member. Therefore, this option does not completely determine the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then we have five remaining workers: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Verma, and Xue. We need to select three of them to be project members, and one of them to be the project leader. Since neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, this means that we can select any three of the remaining workers to be project members. The project leader will be the person who is selected from among Quinn and Ruiz (if either of them is selected as a project member). Therefore, this option completely determines the selection for the project.
  If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then we have five remaining workers: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, Wells, and Xue. We need to select three of them to be project members, and one of them to be the project leader. Since neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, this means that we can select any three of the remaining workers to be project members. The project leader will be the person who is selected from among Quinn and Ruiz (if either of them is selected as a project member). Therefore, this option also completely determines the selection for the project.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  The project leader must be Quinn or Ruiz.
  If Wells is selected, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  If Smith is selected, then Taylor must also be selected.
  We need to find a scenario where exactly three workers are selected and one of them is the project leader.
  Let's consider each choice:
  A: If neither Quinn nor Smith is selected, then the project leader must be Ruiz. However, we still need to select one more project member, which could be any of the other five workers. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  B: If neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected, then the project leader must be Ruiz. The only other worker who can be selected is Wells, since selecting any of the other workers would violate one of the constraints. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  C: If neither Quinn nor Xue is selected, then the project leader must be Ruiz. The other two workers could be any of the other five workers, since neither Smith nor Wells are required to be selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  D: If neither Ruiz nor Wells is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn. The only other worker who can be selected is Smith, since selecting any of the other workers would violate one of the constraints. Therefore, the selection is completely determined.
  E: If neither Ruiz nor Verma is selected, then the project leader must be Quinn. The other two workers could be any of the other five workers, since neither Smith nor Wells are required to be selected. Therefore, the selection is not completely determined.
  Based on the above analysis, the answer is B: Neither Quinn nor Taylor is selected.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 43 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 1.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
  E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Udall cannot work in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 because Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 1 because Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim must work in Zone 3 because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because Quinn is already in Zone 1 and they cannot work in the same sales zone as each other.
  The only option left is that Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2, because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2, because either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and the other works in Zone 3.
  Because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then at most one of them can work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Mahr and Stuckey must work in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  The remaining sales representative, Kim, must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the statement "Mahr works in Zone 1" could be true.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Udall cannot work in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 2.
  If either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  If Quinn and Parra work in the same sales zone, then there are only two possibilities for the sales representatives working in Zone 3: Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey or Kim, Stuckey, and Udall.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then the first possibility is eliminated.
  Therefore, Mahr could work in Zone 1 if Kim works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall works in Zone 3.
  If Udall works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn works in Zone 1.
  If Quinn works in Zone 1, then Kim works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, none of the choices could be true.
  The answer is "None of the Above".
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall cannot work in Zone 2 because Udall works in the same sales zone as Stuckey.
  Therefore, Tiao works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Udall does not work in Zone 2.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao does not work in Zone 1.
  If Tiao does not work in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn works in Zone 3.
  If there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then either Parra or Quinn works in Zone 3, so Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Mahr works in Zone 3.
  The only choice that could be true is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that zone.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and Udall must work in Zone 2.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the only possible option is that Stuckey works in Zone 3.
  The answer is D: Stuckey works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must also work in that sales zone.
  This means that only Zones 1 and 3 are possible because we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We also know that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, if Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then the only possibility is that they work in Zone 3, and Parra works in Zone 1.
  The answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall can't work in Zone 2 because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Udall can't work in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 2 because Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 2, then Parra must work in Zone 1 because Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1 because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Kim must work in Zone 2 because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim works in Zone 2.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall must work in Zone 3.
  Because there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then either Parra or Tiao must work in Zone 3.
  If Tiao works in Zone 3, then Udall must work in Zone 2, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Quinn must work in Zone 3 as well.
  If Quinn works in Zone 3, then Mahr cannot work in Zone 1 because that would leave only Stuckey to work in Zone 2, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 1.
  If Kim works in Zone 2, then Tiao must work in Zone 1, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, Kim cannot work in Zone 2.
  If Stuckey works in Zone 2, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, Stuckey cannot work in Zone 2.
  The only remaining option is that Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Mahr and Stuckey work in the same sales zone, then Udall should also work in that same sales zone because Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Udall works in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Tiao cannot work in that sales zone because Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao cannot work in the same sales zone as Mahr and Stuckey, then Parra should work in that sales zone because Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in the same sales zone as Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall, then Quinn should work in the same sales zone as well because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, so Kim cannot work in Zone 2 because there are not enough sales representatives left to work in Zone 3 and satisfy the condition.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 3.
  The answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  From the constraints, we know that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at the two ends of the row.
  From the third constraint, we know that the optometrist or the veterinarian must be next to the pharmacy.
  From the second constraint, we know that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  From the fourth constraint, we know that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  Option A is not possible because the pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  Option B is possible because it satisfies all the constraints.
  Option C is not possible because the pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  Option D is not possible because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Option E is not possible because the two restaurants are not separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  
  From the given choices, we need to find the one that satisfies all the constraints.
  We know that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants will be at either end of the row.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. So, we can place the optometrist or the veterinarian next to the pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. So, we can place two businesses between the two restaurants.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can place them apart.
  
  Let's try to apply these constraints to each of the given options:
  A: The pharmacy is at one end, and one of the restaurants is at the other end. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist. The two restaurants are not separated by two other businesses. The toy store is next to the veterinarian. This does not satisfy all the constraints.
  B: The pharmacy is at one end, and one of the restaurants is at the other end. The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian. The two restaurants are separated by two other businesses. The toy store is not next to the veterinarian. This satisfies all the constraints.
  C: The pharmacy is not at one end. The two restaurants are not separated by two other businesses. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist. The toy store is next to the veterinarian. This does not satisfy all the constraints.
  D: The pharmacy is not at one end. The two restaurants are not separated by two other businesses. The pharmacy is not next to the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store is next to the veterinarian. This does not satisfy all the constraints.
  E: The pharmacy is not at one end. The two restaurants are not separated by two other businesses. The pharmacy is next to the optometrist. The toy store is next to the restaurant. This does not satisfy all the constraints.
  
  Only option B satisfies all the given constraints.
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Using these constraints, we can eliminate some answer choices.
  Answer choice A and C have the pharmacy in the middle, which violates the first constraint.
  Answer choice D has the pharmacy in the middle and the toy store next to the veterinarian, which violates the third and fourth constraints.
  Answer choice E has the two restaurants next to each other, which violates the second constraint.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The pharmacy must be at one end and one of the restaurants at the other end.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the given options, we can eliminate option A because it violates the rule that the pharmacy must be at one end. We can also eliminate option C because it violates the rule that the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. We can eliminate option D because it violates the rule that the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. We can eliminate option E because it violates the rule that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  From the above constraints, we can deduce that the pharmacy and one of the restaurants must be at either end of the row. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. 
  From the above constraints, we can deduce that the order of the businesses in spaces 1 through 7 must be:
  pharmacy, optometrist/veterinarian, restaurant, any other business, any other business, toy store, restaurant
  Therefore, only choice B satisfies the above constraints.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  The optometrist, shoe store, and toy store can be located anywhere in the row.
  From the constraints, we can infer that the order of the businesses must be:
  Pharmacy - Optometrist or Veterinarian - Business(es) - Restaurant - Business(es) - Restaurant - Pharmacy
  We can eliminate options A and E because the pharmacy is not at one end of the row.
  We can eliminate option D because the toy store is next to the veterinarian.
  Option C has the restaurant next to the pharmacy which violates the constraint.
  Therefore, the answer is B: pharmacy, veterinarian, optometrist, shoe store, restaurant, toy store, restaurant
Action: Answer("B")

  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other.
  Therefore, the pharmacy and one of the restaurants will occupy space 1 and space 7, but it is unknown which will occupy which space.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the two restaurants cannot occupy space 2 and space 3, or space 5 and space 6.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot occupy space 2 or space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the veterinarian cannot occupy space 6.
  The shoe store can occupy any space except space 1, space 2, space 6, and space 7.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 45 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If X is mentioned in chapter 1, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
  C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
  D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
  E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R, S, T, U, and Z must be mentioned in the remaining six chapters.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, which violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 6 and Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 2, S must be mentioned in chapter 5, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  The only choice that satisfies these conditions is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Also, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 6, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z must be mentioned in chapter 4 or chapter 5, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and R must be mentioned in chapter 7, which satisfies all the constraints.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 and W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6, which violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  From the constraint, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, so it must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  From the constraint, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, so it must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  From the constraint, there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4, and R must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 7.
  From the constraint, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  The only choice that fits this scenario is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1 and U is mentioned in chapter 2, then R and S cannot be mentioned in chapters 3 and 4.
  If S is not mentioned in chapter 2, then it must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If Z is not mentioned in chapter 2, then it must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, the possible order of clues is: X, U, Z, T, R, S, W.
  The answer is E: Z is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If T is mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, but it can be mentioned in either chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, but it can be mentioned in either chapter 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3, but it can be mentioned in either chapter 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or D.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. So, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and it cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 as well. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4 or 5.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. So, if X is mentioned in chapter 1, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4 or 5, and Z, W, and S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and W must be mentioned in chapter 7. But, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, this option is not valid.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 5 and W must be mentioned in chapter 3. But, S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, this option is also not valid.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3 and this option is not valid.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. This option is valid.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 and this option is not valid.
  Therefore, the answer is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2 and X must be mentioned in chapter 1.
  The clue T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and it cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 7, then S must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, the only possible option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is not possible.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R and S cannot be mentioned in chapters 2 and 3 because they will be adjacent to X.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because S cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3 because it will be adjacent to X.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  The only remaining option is C: S is mentioned in chapter 2.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and T must be mentioned before W, so T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then S and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, Z must be mentioned in chapter 4, S must be mentioned in chapter 5, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 2. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 2, Z must be mentioned in chapter 4, T must be mentioned in chapter 3, and W must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  In either case, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 3. Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, the answer is B: R is mentioned in chapter 7.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2, so W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 and Z cannot be mentioned in chapter 4.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, so W cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 4 or later, and X must be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 1, then U must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, R cannot be mentioned in chapter 2 because R cannot be adjacent to U.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or later.
  The only valid option is D: W is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 46 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
- There are only three photographers, so the other two photographers (besides Gagnon) must each have at least one photograph in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then none of Hue's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section would be zero, which would violate the constraint.
- If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be one, which is consistent with the constraint.
- If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section would be zero, which would violate the constraint.
- If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section would be two, which is consistent with the constraint.
- If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section would be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section. However, this would mean that Fuentes and Hue would have all six photographs between them, which would violate the constraint that each photographer can have at most three photographs in total.
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then neither of the two photographs in the Sports section can be by Gagnon.
- None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- Therefore, the two photographs by Gagnon must be in either the Lifestyle or Metro section.
- At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
- Therefore, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then they must be in the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
- If Gagnon's photographs are in the Lifestyle and Metro sections, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
- The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue because it would mean that there are no Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
- Thus, the only possible scenario is that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
- None of the photographs in the Metro section can be by Gagnon because both of Gagnon's photographs are already assigned to the Lifestyle section and the Metro section.
- Thus, both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes.
- Therefore, it is not possible for both photographs in the Metro section to be by Fuentes.
- The only remaining option is that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
- Therefore, the answer is D: One photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
- If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, both photographs in the Lifestyle or Metro sections are by Gagnon.
- If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon, then the condition "At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section" cannot be satisfied. Therefore, both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
- If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then the condition "The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section" cannot be satisfied. Therefore, neither of the photographs in the Sports section is by Gagnon. 
- If neither of the photographs in the Sports section is by Gagnon, then both photographs in the Lifestyle section must be by Hue and Fuentes, and both photographs in the Sports section must be by Hue. 
- Therefore, the only choice that could be true is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
  Thus, one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes and the other photograph is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and the other photograph is either by Fuentes or Hue.
  Therefore, Option A cannot be true because it states that both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue.
  Option B could be true because one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and the other is by Hue.
  Option C cannot be true because it states that both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  Option D could be true because one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and the other is by Hue.
  Option E cannot be true because we already concluded that one photograph in the Sports section is by Fuentes and the other is by Hue, so both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
  Therefore, the answer is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there will be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which violates the condition.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then we have one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section, and one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section, which satisfies the conditions.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then we have two photographs by Fuentes in the Metro section, which violates the condition.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then we have one photograph by Hue in the Lifestyle section, which satisfies the conditions.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then we have two photographs by Hue in the Sports section, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, the answer is B: One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then there must be at least one photograph by either Fuentes or Hue in the Lifestyle section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Thus, if both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then the only possible option is that one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the two photographs by Gagnon must be in either the Lifestyle or the Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This means that there must be two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which is not possible because there can be no more than three photographs by any one photographer in any one section. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. This means that the other photograph in the Lifestyle section cannot be by Hue because Hue does not have any photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, option B is not possible.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon, then none of the photographs in the Metro section can be by Fuentes. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon, then the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes. This means that there must be two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Since the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, there must also be two Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section. Therefore, option D is possible.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Gagnon, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This means that there must be two Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which is not possible because there can be no more than three photographs by any one photographer in any one section. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Gagnon's photographs in the Lifestyle and Metro sections must be 1 or 2.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be no Fuentes photograph in the Sports section. This is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is different from the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. This is not possible.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no Hue photograph in the Lifestyle section. This is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then there would be no Gagnon photograph in the Lifestyle section. This is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section. Therefore, the only section that can have both photographs by Gagnon is either Lifestyle or Metro.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there would be no photograph in the Lifestyle section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, which violates the given condition. Therefore, option A is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be different from the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which violates the given condition. Therefore, option B is not possible.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then there would be no photograph in the Metro section by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section, which violates the given condition. Therefore, option C is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be different from the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which violates the given condition. Therefore, option D is not possible.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section would be different from the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which violates the given condition. Therefore, option E is not possible.
  Therefore, none of the options could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If both photographs in one of the three sections are by Gagnon, then Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Hue has no photographs in the Sports section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  If both photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Hue, then there are no photographs by Fuentes or Gagnon in the Lifestyle section. This means that Fuentes has no photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the condition that the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must be the same as the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then Fuentes has at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section and at least one photograph in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes has exactly one photograph in the Metro section, and that photograph is not taken by Gagnon. Therefore, B is possible.
  If both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes, then Fuentes has exactly two photographs in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section. Therefore, Hue has exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section and two in the Sports section. This means that both photographs in the Sports section are not taken by Gagnon, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, C is not possible.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section. Therefore, Fuentes has exactly two photographs in the Sports section and one in the Lifestyle section. This means that Hue has exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section and two in the Sports section. Therefore, D is possible.
  If both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue, then Hue has exactly two photographs in the Lifestyle section and Gagnon has exactly two photographs in the Metro section. Therefore, Fuentes has exactly one photograph in the Sports section, and that photograph is not taken by Gagnon. This means that Gagnon has no photographs in the Sports section, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, E is not possible.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 47 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We can start by making a timeline of the auction days and the antiques that will be auctioned.
  June 1st: [not sundial]
  June 2nd: [harmonica/lamp/mirror]
  June 3rd: [?]
  June 4th: [?]
  June 5th: [?]
  June 6th: [?]
  From the given conditions, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it will be auctioned on June 2nd through June 6th.
  We also know that if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. So, if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st. However, the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, choice B is not true.
  We also know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Finally, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. So, the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the mirror must also be auctioned on June 1st, but the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the above analysis, we can conclude that the only true statement is choice E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to make a chart to keep track of all the possible orders in which the antiques can be auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, if the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th. If the harmonica is auctioned on June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 6th, and the lamp cannot be auctioned.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. Therefore, if the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 6th. If the sundial is auctioned on June 6th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th, and the vase cannot be auctioned.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. Therefore, if the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th, and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, and the vase cannot be auctioned. If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned, and the vase cannot be auctioned. If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned, and the vase cannot be auctioned.
  Using the chart, we can see that the lamp could be auctioned on June 2nd, so the answer is B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a timeline of the auction dates for each antique.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
    - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
    - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
    - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
    - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We can use these conditions to eliminate answer choices that are impossible.
  For example, if the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, then it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned before the harmonica and the vase, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
  Let's try to eliminate answer choices:
    - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.
        * If the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
        * If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
        * However, the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror, which means it must be auctioned on June 2nd.
        * This creates a contradiction, since the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd if the harmonica and the lamp are auctioned on June 3rd or later.
        * Therefore, A is not possible.
    - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd.
        * If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st.
        * If the mirror is auctioned before the lamp, then it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
        * If the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
        * This leaves the vase to be auctioned on June 3rd, the table to be auctioned on June 4th, and the mirror to be auctioned on June 5th.
        * Therefore, B is a possible timeline.
    - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
        * If the vase is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the lamp must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
        * If the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then it must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
        * This creates a contradiction, since the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 3rd or later if the vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
        * Therefore, C is not possible.
    - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
        * If the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
        * If the mirror is auctioned before the lamp, then it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
        * If the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then it must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
        * This leaves the vase to be auctioned on June 4th, the table to be auctioned on June 5th, and the mirror to be auctioned on June 6th.
        * Therefore, D is a possible timeline.
    - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th.
        * If the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
        * If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp.
        * If the sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase, then it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
        * This leaves the harmonica to be auctioned on June 1st, the vase to be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table to be auctioned on June 3rd.
        * Therefore, E is a possible timeline.
  We have found two possible timelines: B and E.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or E.
Action: Answer("B or E")

Thought:
  From the conditions, we know that:
  - The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  - The sundial is auctioned before the mirror and the vase.
  - The table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase.
  - If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned before the lamp.
  We can create a table to help us visualize the possible order of the auctions.
  
| Day       | 1st Auction | 2nd Auction | 3rd Auction | 4th Auction | 5th Auction | 6th Auction |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| June 1st  | Not Sundial |             |             |             |             |             |
| June 2nd  |             |             |             |             |             |             |
| June 3rd  |             |             |             |             |             |             |
| June 4th  |             |             |             |             |             |             |
| June 5th  |             |             |             |             |             |             |
| June 6th  |             |             |             |             |             |             |

  We can start by placing the sundial on June 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th, since it cannot be on June 1st.
  If the sundial is on June 2nd, then the table must be on June 1st and the harmonica cannot be on June 3rd or June 4th. This would mean that the harmonica must be on June 5th or June 6th, and the mirror and vase must be on June 3rd and June 4th, but we cannot determine which is which. This scenario does not help us determine which statement could be true.
  If the sundial is on June 3rd, then the table must be on June 1st, and the harmonica cannot be on June 2nd or June 3rd. This would mean that the harmonica must be on June 4th or June 5th, and the lamp, mirror, and vase must be on June 2nd, June 4th, and June 5th, but we cannot determine which is which. This scenario does not help us determine which statement could be true.
  If the sundial is on June 4th, then the table must be on June 1st, and the harmonica cannot be on June 2nd or June 3rd. This would mean that the harmonica must be on June 5th or June 6th, and the lamp, mirror, and vase must be on June 2nd, June 3rd, and June 5th, but we cannot determine which is which. This scenario does not help us determine which statement could be true.
  If the sundial is on June 5th, then the table cannot be on June 1st or June 2nd. This would mean that the table must be on June 3rd or June 4th, and the harmonica must be on June 2nd or June 3rd. If the harmonica is on June 2nd, then the lamp and mirror must be on June 4th and June 5th, but we cannot determine which is which. This would mean that the vase must be on June 6th, which means that the mirror must be on June 5th. Therefore, the statement "The mirror is auctioned on June 5th" is true.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule of which antiques are auctioned on which days.
  From the first condition, we know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the second condition, if the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd. However, this contradicts the third condition, which states that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror, so this scenario is not possible.
  If the lamp is not auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 2nd or later. This means that the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or later as well.
  From the third condition, we know that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase. This means that the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  From the fourth condition, we know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means that the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  Using these conditions, we can create the following schedule:
  June 1st: Table
  June 2nd: Sundial, Mirror
  June 3rd: Lamp
  June 4th: Vase
  June 5th: Harmonica
  June 6th: None
  From this schedule, we can see that the mirror is auctioned on June 2nd, so (A) is true. The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, so (D) is also true. The vase is not auctioned on June 2nd, so (C) is false. The lamp is not auctioned on June 2nd, so (B) is false. The mirror is auctioned on June 5th, so (E) is false.
  Therefore, the answer is A or D. 
Action: Answer("A or D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule for the auction. 
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 
  We also know that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase, but not both. Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd. 
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the harmonica and the mirror cannot be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th. 
  Using these conditions, we can create a schedule and check each choice to see if it could be true. 
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the harmonica must be auctioned before the mirror if the lamp is auctioned after the harmonica. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. This is possible if the table is auctioned on June 1st and the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd. Then, the lamp can be auctioned on June 2nd and the mirror on June 4th. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. This is not possible because the sundial must be auctioned before the vase. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. This is not possible because the sundial must be auctioned before the mirror and the vase. Therefore, this choice is not true.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. This is possible if the table is auctioned on June 1st, the harmonica is auctioned on June 3rd, the lamp is auctioned on June 4th, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, and the vase is auctioned on June 6th. Therefore, this choice could be true.
  The possible choices are B and E. 
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it will be auctioned on one of the remaining five days.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, so the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. This means the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the lamp is auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th.
  The vase can be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  Therefore, the following could be true:
    - A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (False, because the sundial must be auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror.)
    - B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. (False, because if the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible.)
    - C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. (False, because the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd.)
    - D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. (True, because if the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd, the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, and the table must be auctioned on June 1st.)
    - E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. (False, because if the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, which is not possible.)
  Therefore, the answer is D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd.
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find a valid arrangement of the antiques that satisfies all the given conditions.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase, so it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, and June 4th in some order.
  If the table is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, so they must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th in some order.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd, then the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, so they must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th in some order.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the vase cannot be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, so they must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, and June 3rd in some order.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  There are two cases to consider: the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp and the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica.
  If the harmonica is auctioned before the lamp, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. There are two subcases to consider: the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase is auctioned before the harmonica.
  If the lamp is auctioned before the harmonica, then the mirror must also be auctioned before the lamp. There are two subcases to consider: the table is auctioned before the harmonica or the vase is auctioned before the harmonica.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  There are three cases to consider: the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, or the sundial is auctioned on June 4th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, and June 5th in some order.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 3rd, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th, June 5th, and June 6th in some order.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th and June 6th in some order.
  Based on the above analysis, the only valid arrangement of the antiques that satisfies all the given conditions is:
  June 1st: table
  June 2nd: sundial, vase, mirror
  June 3rd: harmonica, lamp
  June 4th: mirror, vase
  June 5th: lamp
  June 6th: harmonica
  Therefore, the following could be true:
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. (True)
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. (False)
  C: The vase is auctioned on. June 2nd. (False)
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. (True)
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. (False)
Action: Answer("AD")
Response 8:
Thought:
  According to the conditions, the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial must be auctioned on either June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on either June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase must be auctioned on either June 5th or June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on either June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd.
  B: The lamp is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on either June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  C: The vase is auctioned on June 2nd. - This is not possible because the vase must be auctioned on either June 5th or June 6th.
  D: The lamp is auctioned on June 3rd. - This is not possible because the lamp must be auctioned on either June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  E: The mirror is auctioned on June 5th. - This is not possible because the harmonica and the mirror must be auctioned on either June 1st or June 2nd.
  
Therefore, the answer is A: The mirror is auctioned on June 2nd.

  We know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or the vase, but not both.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  We need to find a possible order of the auctions that satisfies all these conditions and has the item in question auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the vase must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. But in this case, the sundial cannot be auctioned earlier than the vase, which violates a condition. So the table must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 1st, then the table must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. But in this case, the table cannot be auctioned earlier than the harmonica, which violates a condition. So the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd. If the lamp is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, and the table must be auctioned on June 3rd, which satisfies all conditions.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 48 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true, no matter how many trades are made?
Choices:
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building.
Response 0:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Therefore, the Yates House (class 3) can be traded for two class 2 buildings, or one class 2 building can be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  The Garza Tower (class 1) can be traded for two class 2 buildings.
  The Flores Tower (class 1) cannot be traded for two class 2 buildings because it is already a class 1 building.
  The Meyer Building is a class 2 building, so it cannot be traded for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is because Southco only owns two buildings, so it cannot own three buildings. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  RealProp owns Garza Tower, Yates House, and Zimmer House.
  Southco owns Flores Tower and Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns King Building, Meyer Building, and Ortiz Building.
  One trade must involve one building for one other building of the same class.
  One trade must involve one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings.
  One trade must involve one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns one class 1 building, two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns one class 1 building, one class 2 building.
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (False, because RealProp does not own any of these buildings)
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. (False, because Southco does not own the Meyer Building)
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. (False, because Southco does not own any of these buildings)
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. (False, because Trustcorp does not own the Yates House)
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. (True, this is possible as long as RealProp owns Yates House and Zimmer House, and Southco owns Flores Tower) 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We know that RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). 
  Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds:
    Trading one building for one other building of the same class
    Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings
    Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is not possible, because RealProp does not own the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco are the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building. This is not possible, because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. This is not possible, because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This is possible, because Trustcorp could have traded the King Building and the Meyer Building for the Flores Tower and the Yates House.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp are the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building. This is not possible, because Trustcorp does not own the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We can use process of elimination to determine which statement cannot be true.
  Statement A cannot be true because RealProp only owns class 1 and class 3 buildings, while the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2.
  Statement B cannot be true because the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp, not Southco.
  Statement C could be true, as Trustcorp owns the King Building and the Ortiz Building, which are both class 2.
  Statement D could be true, as Trustcorp owns the Meyer Building, which is class 2, and RealProp owns the Yates House, which is class 3.
  Statement E could be true, as Trustcorp owns the Lynch Building, which is class 2, and RealProp owns the Garza Tower, which is class 1.
  Therefore, the statement that cannot be true is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades must be made of exactly one of the three kinds.
  Therefore, the buildings that each company owns cannot change classes.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp are all class 3 or lower, but the buildings owned by Trustcorp are all class 2 or higher. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  B: Southco owns one class 1 building and one class 2 building, but this statement implies that Southco owns two class 2 buildings. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  C: This statement implies that Southco owns three buildings, all of which are class 2 or higher. However, Southco only owns two buildings, one of which is class 1. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  D: Trustcorp owns no class 1 buildings, but this statement implies that it owns one. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  E: RealProp owns the Garza Tower, but this statement implies that Trustcorp owns it. Therefore, this cannot be true.
  The statement that cannot be true is A, "The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building."
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  RealProp has no class 2 buildings.
  Southco has no class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp has no class 1 buildings.
  Therefore, A, B, C, and D are all impossible.
  E is possible because Trustcorp could trade the King Building for the Garza Tower and the Ortiz Building for the Lynch Building.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  We need to determine which statement is impossible, no matter how many trades are made.
  RealProp's buildings are the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3).
  Southco's buildings are the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2).
  Trustcorp's buildings are the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2.
  Statement A cannot be true because RealProp does not own any of the buildings listed.
  Statement B cannot be true because Southco does not own the Meyer Building.
  Statement C cannot be true because Southco does not own the King Building or the Ortiz Building.
  Statement D is possible because Trustcorp could trade for the Yates House.
  Statement E is possible because Trustcorp could trade for the Garza Tower and Southco could trade for the Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades can only be made between buildings of the same class or between a class 1 building and two class 2 buildings or between a class 2 building and two class 3 buildings.
  A: The buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because these buildings are owned by Trustcorp.
  B: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the Garza Tower and the Meyer Building because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Meyer Building is owned by Trustcorp.
  C: The buildings owned by Southco cannot be the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building because the King Building and the Ortiz Building are owned by Trustcorp.
  D: The buildings owned by Trustcorp can be the Flores Tower and the Yates House. This is possible if Trustcorp trades the King Building for the Garza Tower and then trades the Garza Tower and the Yates House for the Flores Tower.
  E: The buildings owned by Trustcorp cannot be the Garza Tower and the Lynch Building because the Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and the Lynch Building is owned by Southco.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp cannot be the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  RealProp owns the Garza Tower, the Yates House, and the Zimmer House.
  Southco owns the Flores Tower and the Lynch Building.
  Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
  The trades can only be of three types: 
    - Trading one building for one other building of the same class 
    - Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings 
    - Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
  Option A is not possible because RealProp does not own the buildings Lynch Building and Meyer Building.
  Option B is not possible because Southco does not own the building Meyer Building.
  Option C is not possible because Southco does not own the building King Building and RealProp does not own the building Ortiz Building.
  Option D is not possible because Trustcorp does not own the building Yates House.
  Option E is not possible because Trustcorp does not own the building Garza Tower and Southco does not own the building Lynch Building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We can start by eliminating choices that are possible. 
  Choice A cannot be true because RealProp only owns class 1 and class 3 buildings, and Lynch Building and Meyer Building are both class 2 buildings owned by Trustcorp.
  Choice B cannot be true because Meyer Building is a class 2 building owned by Trustcorp, and Southco does not own any class 3 buildings.
  Choice C cannot be true because King Building is a class 2 building owned by Trustcorp, and Ortiz Building is also a class 2 building owned by Trustcorp.
  Choice D can be true. Trustcorp could own the Flores Tower if it trades one of its class 2 buildings for it.
  Choice E can also be true. Trustcorp could own the Garza Tower if it trades one of its class 2 buildings for it.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The buildings owned by RealProp are the Lynch Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 49 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies—one at Silva University and the other at Thorne University. Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned. No photographer can be assigned to both ceremonies. The following constraints apply: Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. If Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
Question: Which one of the following could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony?
Choices:
  A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  D: Heideck, Lai
  E: Knutson, Mays

Explanation: 
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the ceremonies, so Frost and Heideck can be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, so Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it, so Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  This means that the Silva University ceremony can have Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck assigned to it, which is the complete assignment given in choice B. Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Response 1:
Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  The manager must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  Exactly six photographers are available.
  We need to select a combination of photographers that can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  From the given choices, A, B, C, D, E, we need to find the one that includes a combination of photographers that can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony based on the given constraints.
  The only choice that satisfies all the given constraints and can be assigned to the Silva University ceremony is choice B, which includes Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")

Thought:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Exactly six photographers are available—Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays—but not all have to be assigned.
  The manager of a photography business must assign at least two photographers to each of two graduation ceremonies.
  We need to find an assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony that satisfies all the constraints.
  
Solution:
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. Therefore, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to either Silva University or Thorne University ceremony. Let us assume that Frost and Heideck are assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. Therefore, Gonzalez cannot be assigned to the Silva University ceremony. 
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. Therefore, Knutson must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  We have three photographers left: Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays. We know that if Lai and Mays are both assigned, it must be to different ceremonies. Therefore, we can assign Gonzalez, Lai, and Mays to the Thorne University ceremony.
  The complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Heideck, and Knutson.
  
Action: Answer("B")

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have six photographers available - Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson, Lai, and Mays.
  We can eliminate option A as it has four photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option C as it has only two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  We can eliminate option D as it has Heideck assigned to the Silva University ceremony, but it doesn't have Frost assigned to the same ceremony.
  We can eliminate option E as it doesn't have Gonzalez assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

  Exactly six photographers are available and not all have to be assigned.
  We need to find a valid assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  From the given choices, only A and B include Frost and Heideck together.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  Choice A includes Gonzalez, but there is no Lai in the assignment.
  Choice B includes Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck, but there are no more photographers to complete the assignment to Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, none of the given choices could be the complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")

  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  We need at least two photographers for each ceremony.
  Therefore, we can eliminate choices C, D, and E because they do not have at least two photographers assigned to the Silva University ceremony.
  Choice A violates the constraint that if Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.

  We need to assign at least two photographers to the Silva University ceremony.
  We have to check each option to see if it is possible or not.
  
Option A: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck, Knutson
  Frost and Heideck are already assigned together to one of the graduation ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. But we don't have Lai in this option.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck
  Frost and Heideck are already assigned together to one of the graduation ceremonies, so they cannot be assigned to Silva University ceremony.
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. We don't have Lai in this option, but we don't need to assign Lai to Silva University ceremony.
  Therefore, this option is possible.
  
Option C: Gonzalez, Knutson
  Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, so Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony. We don't have Lai in this option.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option D: Heideck, Lai
  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies. But we don't have Frost in this option.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
Option E: Knutson, Mays
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it. But we don't have Heideck in this option.
  Therefore, this option is not possible.
  
The only possible option is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:

  Frost must be assigned together with Heideck to one of the graduation ceremonies.
  If Gonzalez is assigned to the Silva University ceremony, then Lai must be assigned to the Thorne University ceremony.
  If Knutson is not assigned to the Thorne University ceremony, then both Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  There are only two ceremonies, so at least two photographers must be assigned to each ceremony.
  From the above constraints, Frost and Heideck must be assigned to the same ceremony (either Silva or Thorne).
  If Gonzalez is assigned to Silva, then Lai must be assigned to Thorne.
  If Knutson is not assigned to Thorne, then Heideck and Mays must be assigned to it.
  Therefore, the only possible complete assignment of photographers to the Silva University ceremony is Frost, Gonzalez, and Heideck.
  The answer is B: Frost, Gonzalez, Heideck.
Action: Answer("B")

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 50 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A detective is trying to determine the order in which a criminal recruited seven accomplices—Peters, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, Tao, Villas, and White. In addition to discovering that the suspect recruited the accomplices one at a time, the detective has established the following: Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero. Villas was recruited immediately before White. Peters was recruited fourth.
Question: If Tao was recruited second, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Quinn was recruited third.
  B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
  C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
  D: Villas was recruited sixth.
  E: White was recruited third.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
  From the given information, Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruitment would be: [1] [2] [3] [Peters] [5] [6] [7]
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn would be recruited either first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be: [Quinn] [Tao] [3] [Peters] [5] [6] [7]
  If Quinn was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [5] [6] [7]
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White would be recruited either sixth or seventh.
  If White was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [5] [6] [Villas, White]
  If White was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [5] [Villas, White] [7]
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton would be recruited either first, third, fifth, or seventh.
  If Stanton was recruited first, then the order of recruitment would be: [Stanton] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [5] [Villas] [White]
  If Stanton was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Stanton] [Peters] [5] [Villas, White]
  If Stanton was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [Stanton] [5] [Villas, White]
  If Stanton was recruited seventh, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Quinn] [Tao] [Peters] [5] [Villas] [Stanton, White]
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, and five other people.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must have been recruited either first or second.
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, Quinn, and four other people. However, this violates the fact that Peters was recruited fourth, so Quinn cannot be recruited third.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, one other person, Quinn, Rovero, and two other people. This satisfies all the given conditions, so Rovero could be recruited fifth.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, one other person, Quinn, Rovero, Stanton, and one other person. This violates the fact that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or immediately after Tao, so Stanton cannot be recruited sixth.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, one other person, Quinn, Rovero, Villas, White, and one other person. This satisfies all the given conditions, so Villas could be recruited sixth.
  If White was recruited third, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, White, and four other people. This violates the fact that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so White cannot be recruited third.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that Peters was recruited fourth, so we can place him in the order.
  We know that Tao was recruited second, so we can place him in the order.
  We know that Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so we can place Quinn before Rovero.
  We know that Villas was recruited immediately before White, so we can place Villas before White.
  We know that Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be third or fourth.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment could be: Peters, Quinn, Tao, Villas, White, Rovero, Stanton or Peters, Quinn, Tao, Villas, White, Stanton, Rovero.
  The answer choices are:
    A: Quinn was recruited third.
    B: Rovero was recruited fifth.
    C: Stanton was recruited sixth.
    D: Villas was recruited sixth.
    E: White was recruited third.
  If Tao was recruited second, then the only option that could be true is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Tao could not have recruited Peters.
  Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao.
  If Tao was recruited second, then Peters was recruited before Tao.
  If Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, then Quinn could not have been recruited second.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, then Villas could have been recruited sixth.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the recruits would be:
  1. ?
  2. Tao
  3. ?
  4. Peters
  5. ?
  6. ?
  7. Villas
  From the given information, we know that:
  - Peters was recruited fourth, so he cannot be first, second, or third.
  - Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be fifth or sixth.
  - Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas cannot be seventh.
  - Stanton was not recruited immediately before or after Tao, so Stanton cannot be first, second, third, sixth, or seventh.
  Therefore, the only possible order that satisfies the given conditions is:
  1. Quinn
  2. Tao
  3. Rovero
  4. Peters
  5. Stanton
  6. Villas
  7. White
  From this order, we can see that the only statement that could be true is that Quinn was recruited third.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be: [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn must be either [1] or [2].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so Peters must be either [3] or [5].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so Villas must be either [5] or [6].
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so Stanton must be either [4], [6], or [7].
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order would be [1] [Tao] [2] [Quinn] [4] [5] [6]. This is a valid order.
  If Rovero was recruited fifth, then the order would be [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [Rovero] [6]. This is not a valid order because Quinn must be recruited earlier than Rovero.
  If Stanton was recruited sixth, then the order would be [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [Stanton] [7]. This is not a valid order because Stanton cannot be immediately after Tao.
  If Villas was recruited sixth, then the order would be [1] [Tao] [2] [3] [4] [5] [Villas]. This is not a valid order because Villas must be immediately before White.
  If White was recruited third, then the order would be [1] [Tao] [2] [White] [4] [5] [6]. This is not a valid order because Villas must be immediately before White.
  Therefore, the only valid order is if Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the recruits is: [?, Tao, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?].
  Peters was recruited fourth, so the order of recruits is: [?, Tao, ?, Peters, ?, ?, ?].
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so the order of recruits is: [?, Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, ?, ?].
  Villas was recruited immediately before White, so the order of recruits is: [?, Tao, Quinn, Peters, Rovero, Villas, White].
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that White was recruited third.
Action: Answer("E")

  7. Unknown
  
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao, so he cannot be third or fifth. Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Quinn cannot be fifth. Villas was recruited immediately before White, so she cannot be sixth. Therefore, the answer is either A or E.
  
  If Quinn was recruited third, then the order of recruitment is as follows:
  1. Unknown
  2. Tao
  3. Quinn
  4. Peters

  Therefore, both A and E could be true.
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of recruitment would be Peters, Tao, and five others.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, Stanton could not have been recruited second or fourth.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero.
  Therefore, Quinn could not have been recruited fifth or later.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Therefore, Villas and White must be sixth and seventh, but it is unclear which of them was recruited first.
  Peters was recruited fourth.
  Therefore, Peters, Tao, and two others must be the first four, but it is unclear which of them was recruited first or third.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is A: Quinn was recruited third.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Tao was recruited second, then the order of the recruits is: 
  1) unknown, 2) Tao, 3) unknown, 4) Peters, 5) unknown, 6) unknown, 7) unknown.
  Peters was the fourth one recruited, so the order is: 
  1) unknown, 2) Tao, 3) unknown, 4) Peters, 5) unknown, 6) unknown, 7) unknown.
  Quinn was recruited earlier than Rovero, so Rovero must be recruited later than Quinn.
  Villas was recruited immediately before White.
  Stanton was recruited neither immediately before nor immediately after Tao.
  Therefore, if Tao was recruited second, the only option that could be true is that Quinn was recruited third.

  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, which means that Solide's website target is 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target must be 2 days or 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target cannot be 2 days.
  Therefore, Image's website target must be 1 day, and its voicemail target must be 3 days.
  The answer is C: Image's website target is 1 day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target is either 2 days or 3 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Solide's website target must be 1 day if Truvest's website target is 2 days. If Truvest's website target is 1 day, Solide's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 2 days and the other clients' voicemail targets must be 3 days.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Therefore, Image's website target must be 2 days and Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  Therefore, the correct answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.

- If Truvest's website target is shorter than its voicemail target, it means that Truvest's website target is 1 day and its voicemail target is 2 days.
- Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target must be 1 day.
- None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Solide's voicemail target must be longer than its website target.
- Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target must be 1 day and its website target must be 2 days.
- Therefore, the answer is B: Image's website target is 2 days.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 52 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: If Y is fourth, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: J is second.
  B: J is third
  C: Q is first.
  D: Q is third
  E: R is seventh.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third, which violates the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is second, then Q must be third, which means G must be first, and H must be fourth or fifth. This violates the rule that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is third, then Q can be either first or third. If Q is first, then G must be second, and H must be fourth or fifth. This satisfies all the conditions. 
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q is first.
  The answer is C: Q is first.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be either first, second, or third.
  Since Q can only be earlier than S if Q is third, then Q must be third.
  Since G must be earlier than R, then G cannot be seventh, which means R must be seventh.
  Since Q is third, and consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic, then H must be first and J must be second.
  Therefore, J is second, which means the answer is A: J is second.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles is as follows:
  _ _ _ Y _ _ _ 
  S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be fifth or seventh. Therefore, S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be second and R must be fifth. However, Q cannot be second because S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, S is not first.
  If S is second, then Q must be third and R must be fifth. If J is first, then G must be fourth, which violates the rule that J must be earlier than G. Therefore, J is not first. If J is second, then G must be fifth and R must be seventh. However, this violates the rule that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J is not second. If J is third, then G must be sixth and R must be seventh. This satisfies all the conditions.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Since S, Q, and R cannot be consecutive, G and H must come after S and before Q and R.
  J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be fourth.
  If Q is third, then R must be sixth, and G must be seventh.
  Therefore, Q cannot be third, and R cannot be seventh.
  If S is first, then Q must be fourth, and R must be seventh. But Q cannot be consecutive to S, so S cannot be first.
  If S is second, then G and H must be third and fourth, in some order. J must be earlier than G, so J must be first or second. But J cannot be second, because G and H must come after S. Therefore, J must be first.
  If S is third, then Q must be fourth, and R must be seventh. But Q cannot be consecutive to S, so S cannot be third.
  Therefore, S must be second, and the order of the articles is S, J, G, H, Q, Y, R.
  The correct answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S must be first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. But S and Q cover the same topic, which violates the condition.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. And G must be earlier than R. So, J must be first, H must be fifth, and J and H cover the same topic, which violates the condition.
  If S is third, then Q must be first. And G must be earlier than R. So, J must be second, H must be sixth, and R must be seventh.
  Therefore, Q must be first if Y is fourth.
  The answer is C: Q is first.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, Q must be third, and the only article left to edit is R, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R.
  If S is second, then Q must be first, and the only article left to edit is J, which violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  If S is third, then Q must be second, and the order of the articles is Q, G, J, S, Y, R, H.
  Therefore, Q is second, and J is third.
  The answer is B: J is third.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, so S must be first, second, or third.
  Q cannot be first or second because S would have to be earlier than Q, so Q must be third.
  J must be earlier than G, so J cannot be first or second.
  Since Q is third, G must be fourth or later.
  G must be earlier than R, so R must be fifth or later.
  Since Y is fourth, R must be fifth or later, so R must be seventh.
  Therefore, E is true and the answer is E: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If Y is fourth, then the order of the articles can be either QRSYGHJ or GHJQRSY.
  If the order is QRSYGHJ, then we know that S must be earlier than Q, but Q must be third. Therefore, Q must be fourth, and G must be fifth. This means that J must be sixth and H must be seventh. This satisfies the conditions given in the problem.
  If the order is GHJQRSY, then we know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. Therefore, J must be first, G must be second, and R must be third. This means that Q must be fourth, S must be fifth, and Y must be sixth. This satisfies the conditions given in the problem.
  Therefore, both orders satisfy the conditions given in the problem.
  Answer: None of the above (since more than one answer choice could be correct).
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then it means that S must be earlier than Y. Therefore, S must be either first, second, or third.
  If S is first, then Q must be third. This violates the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
  If S is second, then Q must be third. This satisfies all the conditions given in the problem.
  If S is third, then Q must be either first or second. However, if Q is first, then it violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q must be third.
  If Q is third, then G must be either first or second. However, if G is first, then J must be second, which violates the condition that J must be earlier than G.
  Therefore, if Y is fourth, then Q is third and G is second. This means that J must be first, R must be fourth, H must be fifth, S must be sixth, and Y must be seventh.
  Therefore, the answer is B: J is third. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Y is fourth, then S must be earlier than Y, which means S is first, Q is second, and Y is fourth.
  Since G must be earlier than R, and R cannot be second or third, then R must be sixth or seventh.
  Since J must be earlier than G, then J cannot be sixth or seventh, so J must be second or third.
  Therefore, J is either second or third, and Q is either first or third.
  The answer must be one of the choices that includes J being second or third and Q being first or third.
  Choice E is not possible because R cannot be seventh.

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the only possible movies that can be shown on screen 1 are the western, horror film, and mystery.
  The western must be shown before the horror film.
  The mystery must be shown on a different screen than the horror film.
  Therefore, the movie list in choice B: the sci-fi film, the mystery CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first.

  The list of movies that cannot be shown on screen 1 is the horror film.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Screen 1 shows two movies, one at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Therefore, the horror film and the mystery cannot both be on screen 1.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must be on screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the western must be on screen 1 or 2.
  Therefore, the horror film must be on screen 2 if the mystery is on screen 1, or on screen 1 if the mystery is on screen 2.
  Therefore, the possible combinations for screen 1 are: 
    - the sci-fi film and the mystery
    - the western and the horror film
    - the western and the mystery
  Checking each answer choice:
    - A: the sci-fi film, the horror film -> This is not possible because the horror film cannot be on screen 1 if the sci-fi film is also on screen 1.
    - B: the sci-fi film, the mystery -> This is possible.
    - C: the western, the horror film -> This is possible.
    - D: the western, the mystery -> This is possible.
    - E: the western, the sci-fi film -> This is not possible because the western must be on screen 1 or 2, and the sci-fi film cannot be on screen 3.
  Therefore, the answer is E: the western, the sci-fi film.

Response 7:
Thought:
  The western begins before the horror film.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  Screen 1 shows two movies, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the movie shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 cannot be the sci-fi film or the romance.
  The mystery cannot be shown on screen 1 because it is shown on a different screen from the horror film.
  Therefore, the movie shown at 7 P.M. on screen 1 must be the western.
  The horror film must be shown on screen 2 or screen 3.
  If the horror film is shown on screen 2, then the mystery must be shown on screen 3, and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  If the horror film is shown on screen 3, then the mystery must be shown on screen 2, and the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.

    D: The western, the mystery
       This is possible. The horror film can be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
    E: The western, the sci-fi film
       This is NOT possible. The horror film must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M. and the mystery must be shown on a different screen. Therefore, the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M.

  The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
  The western begins at some time before the horror film does.
  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  The romance is not shown on screen 2.
  
  If the western is shown at 7 P.M. on Screen 1, then the horror film cannot be shown on Screen 1 because the western begins at some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the mystery must be shown on Screen 1 at 7 P.M.
  If the mystery is shown on Screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the western cannot be shown on Screen 1 because the western begins at some time before the horror film does. Therefore, the western must be shown on Screen 2 at 7 P.M.
  If the western is shown on Screen 2 at 7 P.M., then the romance cannot be shown on Screen 2 because the romance is not shown on Screen 2. Therefore, the romance must be shown on Screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  If the romance is shown on Screen 1 at 9 P.M., then the sci-fi film must be shown on Screen 2 at 9 P.M. because the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens, and the sci-fi film is not shown on Screen 3.
  Therefore, the only possible list of movies scheduled to be shown on Screen 1 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, is the western, the mystery.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 54 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: Which one of the following must be false?
Choices:
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I.
Response 0:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Let's consider each option to see which one of them must be false.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible because there are seven sales representatives and only three sales zones. So, it is possible that two sales representatives work in the same sales zone. This option could be true.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is not possible because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, at most, three sales representatives could work in Zone 3, but Kim and Stuckey cannot both be among them. This option must be false.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, it is possible that both Mahr and Stuckey work in Zone 3. This option could be true.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. So, it is possible that both Mahr and Udall work in Zone 3. This option could be true.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. This is not possible because Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. If Parra and Stuckey both worked in Zone 1, then Quinn and Udall would have to work in Zone 2 or 3, but this would violate the condition that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. This option must be false.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2. Also, Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. 
  A cannot be false because there is no information about Kim working in any zone.
  B is possible because Stuckey and Udall can work in Zone 3 together. 
  C can be true because there can be more than one sales representative in a zone. 
  D can be true because there can be more than one sales representative in a zone. 
  E can be true because Parra and Stuckey can work in Zone 3 together. 
  Therefore, the answer is A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, which contradicts the given conditions that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can infer the following:
  1. Zone 1 has either Parra or Tiao, but not both.
  2. Zone 2 has either Tiao or Udall, but not both.
  3. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  4. Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  5. There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.

  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1 --> False. If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then there would be only one person in Zone 3, which contradicts condition 5.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 --> Possible. There could be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Kim and Stuckey could be two of them, so this statement is not necessarily false.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 --> Possible. There could be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Stuckey could be two of them, so this statement is not necessarily false.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3 --> Possible. There could be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Udall could be two of them, so this statement is not necessarily false.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1 --> False. Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, so if Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1. But Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone, so if Udall works in Zone 2, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 2. Therefore, it is impossible for Parra and Stuckey to work in the same zone.

  Therefore, the answer is E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1.
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Parra nor Tiao can work in Zone 1. This contradicts the given information.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three people in Zone 3 (since there are more people in Zone 3 than in Zone 2). This means that Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 together, which contradicts the given information.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three people in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 together, which contradicts the given information.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three people in Zone 3. This means that Parra and Quinn cannot be in Zone 3 together, which contradicts the given information.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 2. This contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This statement does not contradict the given information, so it does not have to be false.
Response 4:
Thought:
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone.
  There are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. This contradicts the statement in the first condition.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This statement could be true.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This statement could be true.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3. This satisfies the condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. This statement could be true.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Tiao or Udall cannot work in Zone 2. This contradicts the statement in the second condition.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This is possible as there are seven sales representatives and only three sales zones, but it is not a must-be-true condition. Therefore, A is not the answer.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This cannot be true because if there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and if Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there must be at least four sales representatives in Zone 3, which is not possible given that there are only seven sales representatives in total. Therefore, B must be false.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there is no restriction on Mahr and Stuckey working in the same sales zone. Therefore, C is not the answer.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. This is possible because there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and there is no restriction on Mahr and Udall working in the same sales zone. Therefore, D is not the answer.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. This cannot be true because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, E must be false.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
  
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  - There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (This is possible, since there are seven sales representatives and only three sales zones, so at least two sales representatives must work in the same zone. However, this is not a must-be-true statement, since Kim and Stuckey could also work in other zones.)
  
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is not possible, since if there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, then neither Tiao nor Udall can work in Zone 3. Therefore, this statement must be false.)
  
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. (This is possible, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Stuckey can both work in Zone 3. Therefore, this is not a must-be-false statement.)
  
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. (This is possible, since there are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and Mahr and Udall can both work in Zone 3. Therefore, this is not a must-be-false statement.)
  
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. (This is not possible, since Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone. Therefore, Parra and Stuckey cannot both work in Zone 1. Therefore, this statement must be true.)
  
  Since only one statement must be false, and the only statement that must be false is B, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  From the given conditions, we know that:
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  We can use these conditions to check each statement.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1. - This is false because only one of Parra or Tiao can work in Zone 1, and neither Kim nor Stuckey is mentioned as working in any other zone.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is false because there are more representatives working in Zone 3 than there are in Zone 2, which means that at most three representatives can work in Zone 2. Since Stuckey and Udall both work in the same zone, and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, it follows that Stuckey cannot work in Zone 3.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. - This is possible because neither Mahr nor Stuckey is mentioned as working in any other zone.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3. - This is possible because neither Mahr nor Udall is mentioned as working in any other zone.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I. - This is false because either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Stuckey is not mentioned as working in any other zone.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can infer that:
  - Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  - Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  - Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  - There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1, then Parra or Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. This contradicts the first condition. Therefore, A must be false.
  If Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1, which contradicts the first condition. Therefore, B must be false.
  If Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1, which contradicts the first condition. Therefore, C must be false.
  If Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3, then there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1, which contradicts the first condition. Therefore, D must be false.
  If Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone I, then Quinn must also work in Zone 1, which contradicts the first condition. Therefore, E must be false.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find the statement that cannot be true based on the given conditions.
  Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
  Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same zone.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same zone.
  There are more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  A: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 1 - This is possible because there is no contradiction.
  B: Kim and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 - This is possible because there is no contradiction.
  C: Mahr and Stuckey both work in Zone 3 - This is possible because there is no contradiction.
  D: Mahr and Udall both work in Zone 3 - This is possible because there is no contradiction.
  E: Parra and Stuckey both work in Zone 1 - This cannot be true because Parra and Quinn work in the same zone, and Parra is in Zone 1. Therefore, Stuckey cannot be in Zone 1.
  The answer is E.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 55 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On each of exactly seven consecutive days (day 1 though day 7), a pet shop features exactly one of three breeds of kitten—Himalayan, Manx, Siamese—and exactly one of three breeds of puppy—Greyhound, Newfoundland, Rottweiler. The following conditions must apply: Greyhounds are featured on day 1. No breed is featured on any two consecutive days. Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
Question: Which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  The breeds are featured on exactly seven consecutive days, and no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Therefore, we can try to create a schedule that satisfies the given conditions and check which of the following options could be true.
  Option A is not possible since there are only six breeds in total, and no breed can be featured on all seven days.
  Option B is not possible since Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Option C is not possible since Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  For Option D, we can create a schedule where Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. For example:
  Day 1: Greyhounds and Manx
  Day 2: Newfoundland and Siamese
  Day 3: Himalayans and Greyhounds
  Day 4: Rottweilers and Manx
  Day 5: Siamese and Newfoundland
  Day 6: Manx and Greyhounds
  Day 7: Siamese and Newfoundland
  Option E is not possible since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Option A is not possible because there are only 6 breeds in total, so at least one breed would be featured on only two days.
  Option B is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Option C is not possible because Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  Option D is possible because if Himalayans are not featured on a day, then Rottweilers are also not featured on that day.
  Option E is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and on every day that Himalayans are featured.
- Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1. So, Himalayans can be featured on days 2, 3, and 4 or on days 3, 4, and 5 or on days 4, 5, and 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
- Based on the above conditions, we can eliminate choices A, C, and E.
- Choice B is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
- Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
- Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so if Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, they cannot be featured on day 1. 
- Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they can be featured on days 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans. This means that Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 4, 5, 6, or 7 if Himalayans are featured on any of those days.
- No breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so if Himalayans are featured on day 2 and day 4, then they cannot be featured on day 3 or day 5. 
- Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are not is not possible because Himalayans are featured on at least three days.
- Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not is not possible because Rottweilers cannot be featured on days that feature Himalayans.
- It is possible that there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. For example, if Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, then the other two breeds that are not featured on those days can each be featured on three days.
- It is possible that Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, if Himalayans are not featured on any day other than day 2, day 4, and day 6. In this case, Greyhounds would be featured on day 2, day 4, and day 6 as well.
- It is not possible that Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are because Himalayans cannot be featured on day 1.
- It is possible that Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. For example, if Himalayans are featured on days 2, 4, and 6, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on days 4, 5, 6, or 7, so they can be featured on days 1, 2, and 3.
Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Response 4:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  So, there are only two possible days that Himalayans can be featured: days 2, 3, and 4 or days 4, 5, and 6.
  If Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on any of those days. Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on days 5, 6, and 7, which means that Greyhounds are not featured on every day that Himalayans are.
  If Himalayans are featured on days 4, 5, and 6, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5. Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on days 1, 2, and 3, which means that Himalayans are not featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  From the given conditions, we can deduce that:
    - Greyhounds are featured on days 1, 3, and 5.
    - Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they could be featured on days 2, 4, and 6.
    - Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so they could be featured on days 2 and 4.
  A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days. This cannot be true, as there are only three breeds of kittens and three breeds of puppies.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are. This cannot be true, as Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  C: Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are. This cannot be true, as Himalayans are not featured on day 1 and Greyhounds are featured on day 1, 3, and 5.
  D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not. This cannot be true, as Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  E: Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not. This could be true, as Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  From the first two conditions, we can deduce that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2, day 3, and day 4.
  From the third condition, we can deduce that Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 2 and day 3.
  Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on day 4, day 5, and day 6.
  From the fourth condition, we can deduce that Himalayans cannot be featured on day 5 and day 6.
  Therefore, Himalayans can only be featured on day 2 and day 4.
  We can now fill in the remaining breeds for each day, ensuring that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Using this information, we can check each answer choice:
  A: If each of four breeds is featured on three days, then there are at least 12 days in total, which contradicts the given condition that there are exactly seven consecutive days. So A is not true.
  B: Greyhounds are featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1. Therefore, B is not true.
  C: Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so C is not true.
  D: Himalayans are featured on day 2 and day 4, and Rottweilers are not featured on day 5 and day 6. Therefore, D could be true.
  E: Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, so E is not true.
  The only answer choice that could be true is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Based on the above conditions, we can create a chart to keep track of the breeds featured on each day.
  We can then eliminate answer choices that contradict the given conditions.
  A: If there are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days, then there would be a breed that is featured on two consecutive days, which is not allowed. Eliminate A.
  B: If Greyhounds are featured on every day that Himalayans are, then Himalayans would be featured on day 1, which is not allowed. Eliminate B.
  C: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Greyhounds are, then Greyhounds would be featured on day 1, 4, and 7, which is not allowed. Eliminate C.
  D: If Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not, then Rottweilers would be featured on day 1, 4, and 7, which is not allowed. Eliminate D.
  E: If Rottweilers are featured on every day that Himalayans are not, then Rottweilers would be featured on day 1, which is allowed. Himalayans would be featured on the remaining three days. Eliminate A, B, C, and D. The answer is E.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Choice A is not possible because there are only three breeds of kittens and puppies.
  Choice B is not possible because Greyhounds are only featured on day 1 and Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Choice C is not possible because Himalayans are not featured on day 1.
  Choice D is possible because Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.
  Choice E is not possible because Rottweilers are not featured on day 7.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Himalayans are featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on days 2, 4, 5, and 6.
  Himalayans cannot be featured on days 1 or 7, so they must be featured on days 2, 4, and 5.
  Therefore, Manx and Siamese must be featured on days 3 and 6.
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1, so Himalayans cannot be featured on every day that Greyhounds are.
  Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, so Himalayans are not featured on every day that Rottweilers are not.
  Therefore, the answer is A: There are exactly four breeds that are each featured on three days.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 56 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A maintenance company that takes service requests from three clients—Image, Solide, and Truvest—plans to set targets for its average service response times. Service targets will be set at 3 days, 2 days, or 1 day. Two service targets are set for each client—one for requests received through the maintenance company's website and one for requests received by voicemail. The six targets are set according to the following conditions: None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target. Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
Question: If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then each of the following must be true EXCEPT:
Choices:
  A: Image's website target is 1 day.
  B: Solide's website target is 2 days.
  C: Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
  E: Truvest's voicemail target is 2 days.
Response 0:

  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the maximum voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 3 days.
  If Truvest's website target is 2 days, then Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Solide's voicemail target must be 2 days and Truvest's voicemail target must be 2 days.
  Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day since none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, each of the following statements is true except for the statement that conflicts with the above conditions.
  Statement A is true based on the above conditions.
  Statement B is true based on the above conditions.
  Statement C is true based on the above conditions.
  Statement D is false because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Truvest's website target cannot be 2 days if Solide's website target is 2 days.
  Statement E is true based on the above conditions.
  The answer is D: Truvest's website target is 2 days. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is 1 or 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target, so Solide's website target is 2 or 1 day, and Truvest's website target is 3, 2, or 1 day.
  None of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target, so Image's website target is 1 or 2 days, Solide's website target is 2 days, and Truvest's website target is 1 day.
  Therefore, the only statement that is not necessarily true is A: Image's website target is 1 day, as it could be 2 days.

  If none of the clients have a voicemail target of 3 days, then the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target.
  Solide's voicemail target cannot be 3 days.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets.
  Thus, Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day.
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, the only option that may not be true is option D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If none of the clients has a voicemail target of 3 days, we can infer that the longest voicemail target is 2 days.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target cannot be 1 day because that would make Solide's website target 0 days which is not possible.
  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. Therefore, Image's voicemail target must be 1 day.
  Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. Therefore, Truvest's website target must be 2 days and Solide's website target must be 1 day.
  Based on the above, we can infer that A, B, C, and E are true statements.
  The only statement that is not necessarily true is D, which states that Truvest's website target is 2 days. It could be shorter than 2 days.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Truvest's website target is 2 days.

  Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets, so Image's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Image's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's website target must be 1 day because none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  If Image's voicemail target is 2 days, then Image's website target must be 1 day or 2 days.
  Therefore, it is possible for Image's website target to be 2 days.
  Solide's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Solide's website target is 2 days, then Truvest's website target must be 3 days because Solide's website target must be shorter than Truvest's website target. This contradicts the fact that none of the clients can have a website target that is longer than its voicemail target.
  Therefore, Solide's website target is 1 day.
  Solide's voicemail target is either 1 day or 2 days.
  If Solide's voicemail target is 1 day, then Image's voicemail target must be 2 days because Image's voicemail target must be shorter than the other clients' voicemail targets. This contradicts the fact that none of the clients can have a voicemail target of 3 days.
  Therefore, Solide's voicemail target is 2 days.
  Truvest's website target is either 1 day or 2 days.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 57 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  From the given conditions, at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Hence, there are only two possible cases:
  Case 1: The photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue is by Gagnon.
      In this case, both photographs in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
      The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, but we don't know how many photographs by Fuentes will be in the Sports section.
      None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
      Therefore, we cannot conclude whether any of the photographs in the Sports section are by Hue or not.
  Case 2: The photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue is by either Fuentes or Hue.
      In this case, the other photograph in the Metro section must be by the photographer who has no photograph in the Lifestyle section.
      Therefore, the other photograph in the Metro section must be by Gagnon.
      The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
      None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
      Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
      Hence, the only possible option is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  Gagnon's photographs cannot be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue, and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  A: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Fuentes. It violates the condition that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  B: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon. It violates the condition that one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. It is possible, as long as the other photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  D: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. It violates the condition that one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue. It violates the condition that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one of the photographs in the Metro section must be by either Fuentes or Hue.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be one and the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section must also be one.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because then there would be no photographs in the Sports section by Fuentes, which would violate the constraint.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the third photographer, Gagnon, must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Since each section must have two photographs, and Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section, one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes or Hue.
  If one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes or Hue, then the other photograph in the Metro section cannot be by the same photographer.
  If the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section is the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, and one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one must be by Hue.
  Therefore, it is possible that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there are two possibilities: Fuentes has 1 or 2 photographs in the Lifestyle section and Hue has 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If Fuentes has 1 photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must have 1 photograph in the Metro section.
  If Fuentes has 2 photographs in the Lifestyle section, then Hue must have 2 photographs in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the following could be true: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. The answer is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has no photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Hue has one photograph in the Lifestyle section and Fuentes has one photograph in the Sports section.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because then Fuentes would have three photographs in total.
  Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because then Gagnon would have three photographs in total.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because then Fuentes would have no photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  We also know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section that is not by Fuentes or Hue must be by a photographer who has a photograph in the Metro section.
  We know that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Gagnon.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes and one must be by Hue.
  There are only three photographers, so the remaining photograph in the Metro section must be by the third photographer.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
  The answer is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by another photograph in the Metro section by the same photographer or the other photographer.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then there must be one photograph by Fuentes in the Sports section and one photograph by Hue in the Metro section.
  The remaining photographs can be distributed among the Lifestyle and Metro sections.
  Therefore, the statement "Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue" could be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then:
  - The number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section is equal to the number of Hue photographs in the Lifestyle section.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  - Therefore, Gagnon must have at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Gagnon cannot have any photographs in the Sports section.
  From the above constraints, we can conclude that:
  - Fuentes must have exactly one photograph in the Sports section.
  - Hue must have exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section.
  - Gagnon must have exactly one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The two remaining photographs in the Metro section must be taken by Fuentes.
  - The two remaining photographs in the Sports section must be taken by Gagnon and a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  From the above conclusions, we can see that the only possible option is C: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Fuentes and one is by Hue, then the other two photographs in the Lifestyle section are by Gagnon.
  Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, then the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Fuentes or Hue must be accompanied by a photograph by Gagnon in the Metro section.
  Since none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, then the photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes must be accompanied by a photograph by Hue.
  Therefore, the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  From the above reasoning, we can conclude that:
    - Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Fuentes because there are only two photographs by Fuentes and they are already assigned to the Lifestyle and Sports sections.
    - Both photographs in the Metro section cannot be by Gagnon because there are only three photographs by Gagnon and at least one of them must be assigned to the Lifestyle section.
    - Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Hue because the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Hue must be accompanied by a photograph by Gagnon in the Metro section.
    - Both photographs in the Sports section cannot be by Hue because the photograph in the Sports section by Fuentes must be accompanied by a photograph by Hue.
    - Therefore, neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  The answer is E: Neither photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.

  The panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types, so we need to select one botanist, one chemist, and one zoologist.
  If more than one botanist is selected, then at most one zoologist is selected, so we can select at most one botanist and at most one zoologist.
  F and K cannot both be selected, so we cannot select F and K together.
  K and M cannot both be selected, so we cannot select K and M together.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected, so if we select M, we must also select P and R.
  Let's check each choice:
  Choice A: Selects two botanists and two zoologists, which violates the rule that at most one botanist can be selected if more than one is selected. Incorrect.
  Choice B: Selects one botanist, two chemists, and no zoologists, which violates the rule that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Incorrect.
  Choice C: Selects one botanist, two chemists, and one zoologist, which satisfies all the rules. Keep this choice as a possible answer.
  Choice D: Selects no botanists, two chemists, and two zoologists, which violates the rule that the panel must include at least one scientist of each of the three types. Incorrect.
  Choice E: Selects one botanist, one chemist, and two zoologists, which violates the rule that at most one zoologist can be selected if more than one botanist is selected. Incorrect.

Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to select a panel of five scientists from three botanists, three chemists, and three zoologists.
  We need to have at least one scientist from each type (botanist, chemist, and zoologist).
  If we select more than one botanist, we can select at most one zoologist.
  F and K cannot both be selected.
  K and M cannot both be selected.
  If M is selected, both P and R must be selected.
  
  Option A:
    F and K are both selected, which violates the condition that F and K cannot both be selected.
  Option B:
    This selection includes one botanist (G), one chemist (K), and one zoologist (M), which satisfies the condition of having at least one scientist from each type.
    This selection includes only one botanist, so it satisfies the condition that if more than one botanist is selected, at most one zoologist is selected.
    This selection includes K but not M, so it satisfies the condition that K and M cannot both be selected.

  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio cannot be assigned to 1922.
  We want to know when Mollie must be assigned to 1922.
  If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to 1922. This leaves only Louis and Mollie to be assigned to 1921 and 1924, respectively.
  The answer is D: Tiffany is assigned to 1923.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Yoshio cannot be assigned to any of the years.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1922, then Louis, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio can be assigned to the remaining years.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924 or Onyx is assigned to 1921 or Onyx is assigned to 1924 or Tiffany is assigned to 1923 or Yoshio is assigned to 1921, then Mollie cannot be assigned to 1922.

Response 0:
Thought: 
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding grain is either bay 5 or bay 6.
  The bay holding livestock must be either bay 3 or bay 4.
  The bay holding fuel must be either bay 1 or bay 2.
  Therefore, for exactly three of the six bays, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined.
  The answer is B: three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. Therefore, bay 1 cannot hold produce.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. Therefore, bay 3 cannot hold produce.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then bay 5 must be holding textiles.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. Therefore, bay 6 must be holding livestock.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. Therefore, bay 1 must be holding grain.
  The only bay left is bay 2 which must be holding machinery.
  Therefore, the type of cargo in bays 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 is completely determined.
  The answer is D: five.

  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is bay 6 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  If bay holding produce is bay 4, then the bay holding fuel is bay 2.
  Therefore, the bay holding machinery is bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding machinery is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock is bay 2 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  If the bay holding machinery is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock is bay 6 and the bay holding grain is bay 1.
  In both cases, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 4, and 6 are completely determined.
  Therefore, the answer is C: four.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:

Response 6:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles is either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding fuel is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding grain is either bay 5 or bay 6.
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding livestock is either bay 1 or bay 2.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that bay is holding is completely determined for 4 bays: bays 1, 2, 4, and 6.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If bay 4 is holding produce, then the bay holding textiles must be either bay 3 or bay 5.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 3, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 2, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The remaining bays would then hold machinery, fuel, and livestock.
  If the bay holding textiles is bay 5, then the bay holding livestock must be bay 6, and the bay holding grain must be bay 1. The remaining bays would then hold machinery, fuel, and livestock.
  In either case, the type of cargo for bays 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 would be completely determined.
  Therefore, the answer is D: five.

  We need to find a selection of employees that satisfies all the given conditions and includes at least four employees.
  Let's evaluate each choice:
    - Choice A: If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, this choice is not possible since Paine is also on the team.
    - Choice B: Ortega and Paine are on the team, which is not possible since Myers cannot be on the team if either Ortega or Paine is on the team.
    - Choice C: This choice satisfies all the given conditions and includes at least four employees. Therefore, this is a possible selection of employees for the team.
    - Choice D: If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, this choice is not possible since Thomson is not on the team.
    - Choice E: If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, this choice is not possible since neither Myers nor Yoder is on the team.
  The only possible selection of employees for the team is C.

  The team must include at least four employees.
  Option A includes Myers and Paine, which violates the first condition.
  Option B includes Ortega, which cannot be on the team if Myers is on the team.
  Option C includes neither Myers nor Schmidt, which means neither Paine nor Thomson must be on the team, which violates the second condition.
  Option D includes Schmidt, Thomson, and Yoder, which satisfies the second condition, but does not include Myers or Wong, which violates the third condition.
  Option E includes Wong, Myers, and Yoder, which satisfies the third condition, and includes Thomson, which satisfies the second condition.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Thomson, Wong, Yoder, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers cannot be on the team with Paine and Ortega.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  The team must have at least four members.
  From the above conditions, we can conclude that Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be on the team together, and Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be on the team together.
  To have at least four members, we can add Zayre to the team.
  A possible selection of employees for the team would be Schmidt, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Myers is on the team, neither Ortega nor Paine can be. Therefore, Myers cannot be in the same team with Ortega or Paine.
  If Schmidt is on the team, both Paine and Thomson must also be. Therefore, Schmidt, Paine, and Thomson must be in the same team.
  If Wong is on the team, both Myers and Yoder must also be. Therefore, Wong, Myers, and Yoder must be in the same team.
  The team must include at least four employees.
  Based on the above conditions, one possible selection of employees for the team is: Schmidt, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Ortega, Paine, Thomson, and Zayre.

  Option A: Myers is on the team, so neither Ortega nor Paine can be. But Paine is also on the team, which violates the condition. So, this option is not possible.
  Option B: Ortega and Paine are not on the team, so the first condition is satisfied. But Schmidt is not on the team, which violates the second condition. So, this option is not possible.
  Option C: Paine and Yoder are on the team, so the third condition is satisfied. Schmidt is also on the team, so both Paine and Thomson must also be on the team, which satisfies the second condition. Zayre is also on the team, which makes a total of four employees. Therefore, this option is possible.
  Option D: Schmidt, Thomson, and Yoder are on the team, which satisfies the second condition. But Myers is not on the team, which violates the third condition. So, this option is not possible.
  Option E: Wong, Myers, and Yoder are on the team, which satisfies the third condition. Thomson is also on the team, which satisfies the second condition. Zayre is also on the team, which makes a total of four employees. Therefore, this option is possible.

Context: A software company employs exactly seven sales representatives—Kim, Mahr, Parra, Quinn, Stuckey, Tiao, and Udall—to work in its three sales zones—Zone 1, Zone 2, and Zone 3. Each sales representative works in exactly one of the sales zones, in accordance with the following conditions: Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1. Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other. Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. There are more of the sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
Question: If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Kim works in Zone 2.
  B: Mahr works in Zone 2.
  C: Parra works in Zone 3.
  D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
  E: Udall works in Zone 3.
Response 0:
Thought:
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Zone 2 must have fewer sales representatives than Zone 1.
- From the given conditions, either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, and either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
- If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 3, and both Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 2. This means that there are more representatives in Zone 2 than in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1.
- If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao works in Zone 2, and both Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3. This satisfies the given conditions, and there are more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3. Therefore, Parra can work in Zone 1.
- Kim, Mahr, and Quinn are not mentioned in the given conditions, so their sales zones are flexible.
- Therefore, the possible options are:
  - Parra works in Zone 1, Tiao works in Zone 2, and Stuckey and Udall work in Zone 3.
  - Kim, Mahr, and Quinn can work in any of the three sales zones.
- From the given options, the only one that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
- This is because if Parra works in Zone 3, then there are more representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and more representatives in Zone 1 than in Zone 3.
- Therefore, the answer is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are only 1 or 2 representatives working in Zone 2.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then the other works in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 1 or Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, then they both work in either Zone 2 or Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are at most 2 representatives working in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are only two possibilities:
  1. Two sales representatives work in Zone 1 and one sales representative works in Zone 2, while the remaining four sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  2. Three sales representatives work in Zone 1 and two sales representatives work in Zone 2, while the remaining two sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1 and Udall cannot work in Zone 1 or Zone 2. 
  From the remaining sales representatives, Kim, Mahr, Quinn, and Stuckey, at most one of them can work in Zone 1, at most one of them can work in Zone 2, and at least two of them must work in Zone 3. 
  Therefore, the only possible option is that two sales representatives work in Zone 1 and one sales representative works in Zone 2, while the remaining four sales representatives work in Zone 3. 
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other. Therefore, Parra and Quinn both work in Zone 1, and Stuckey and Udall both work in Zone 3.
  Now, we are left with Kim, Mahr, and Tiao. Since Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, either Kim or Mahr must work in Zone 1. 
  Therefore, the possible options are:
  - Kim works in Zone 1 and Mahr works in Zone 3.
  - Mahr works in Zone 1 and Kim works in Zone 3.
  - Tiao works in Zone 1 and Kim or Mahr works in Zone 3.
  From these options, the only possible answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there are either 4 or 5 sales representatives in Zone 1.
  Since Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1, and Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2, there must be at least one sales representative in each of Zone 1 and Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, so they are either both in Zone 1, or both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so they are either both in Zone 1, or both in Zone 2, or both in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 1, then there are at most 3 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition.
  If Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 2, then there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, Parra and Quinn are both in Zone 3, and there are either 3 or 4 sales representatives in Zone 3.
  Since there are at most 2 sales representatives in Zone 2, either Tiao or Udall (but not both) is in Zone 2, and the other one is in Zone 1.
  If Tiao is in Zone 1, then Parra is in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition.
  Therefore, Udall is in Zone 1, and Tiao is in Zone 2.
  Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, and they must both be in Zone 3.
  Therefore, none of the choices could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then there are only two possible configurations:
  Configuration 1: 4 sales representatives work in Zone 3, 2 work in Zone 2, and 1 works in Zone 1.
  Configuration 2: 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3, 2 work in Zone 2, and 2 work in Zone 1.
  If Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1, then Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, then either both of them work in Zone 1 or both of them work in Zone 3.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, then either both of them work in Zone 2 or both of them work in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Configuration 2 is not possible because there are only 2 sales representatives in Zone 1 in that configuration.
  Therefore, Configuration 1 must be true.
  If Parra works in Zone 3, then Tiao works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 1.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra works in Zone 2 and Udall works in Zone 3.
  Therefore, Parra could work in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives working in Zone 1 is either 1, 2, or 3.
  Either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  Either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other.
  Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Parra must work in Zone 3, and there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, D is a possible answer.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao must work in Zone 3, and there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, which satisfies the condition. Therefore, C is a possible answer.
  If neither Parra nor Tiao works in Zone 1, then there must be three sales representatives in Zone 1, and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, and Stuckey and Udall must work in Zone 2. Therefore, E is a possible answer.
  If Kim or Mahr works in Zone 2, then Tiao and Udall must work in Zone 1 and Parra and Quinn must work in Zone 3, which means there will be more sales representatives in Zone 3 than in Zone 2. Therefore, A and B are not possible answers.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be either 3 or 4 sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1.
  We also know that either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  If Tiao works in Zone 1, then Udall must work in Zone 3, which means there are only two sales representatives working in Zone 3, which contradicts the given condition that there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Parra works in Zone 1, and Tiao works in Zone 2.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other.
  If there are 3 sales representatives working in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, and Stuckey must work in Zone 3, which means Udall cannot work in Zone 2, and (E) is not possible.
  If there are 4 sales representatives working in Zone 1, then Kim, Mahr, Stuckey, and Udall must work in Zone 3, which means Parra cannot work in Zone 3, and (C) is not possible.
  Therefore, (A), (B), and (D) are possible.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then the number of sales representatives in Zone 3 can be either 4 or 5.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Tiao cannot work in Zone 1. Therefore, Tiao must work in Zone 2, and Udall must work in Zone 3.
  If Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone, and Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1 as well.
  If Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone, and Udall works in Zone 3, then Stuckey must also work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, there are at least three sales representatives working in Zone 3: Udall, Stuckey, and one more person. This means that there are at most two sales representatives working in Zone 1.
  If there are more sales representatives working in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then there must be exactly two sales representatives working in Zone 1, and four sales representatives working in Zone 3.
  The only person who can work in both Zone 1 and Zone 2 is Tiao. Therefore, Tiao cannot work in Zone 1, and Parra must work in Zone 1.
  If Parra works in Zone 1, then Quinn must work in Zone 1 as well, and Kim must work in Zone 2.
  Therefore, Mahr cannot work in Zone 2, and neither can Tiao.
  The only option that could be true is C: Parra works in Zone 3.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, then it must be the case that either 3 or 4 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it must be the case that either 4 or 5 sales representatives work in Zone 1.
  From the given conditions, we know that either Parra or Tiao (but not both) works in Zone 1 and either Tiao or Udall (but not both) works in Zone 2.
  Since there are only three sales zones, the remaining sales representatives must work in the third sales zone, which is Zone 3.
  Therefore, if more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then it must be the case that only 4 sales representatives work in Zone 1 and 3 sales representatives work in Zone 3.
  From the given conditions, we know that Parra works in Zone 1 and Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone. Thus, neither Stuckey nor Udall can work in Zone 3.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is D: Tiao works in Zone 1.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
- We know that either Parra or Tiao works in Zone 1.
- If more sales representatives work in Zone 1 than in Zone 3, then Parra works in Zone 1 and Tiao works in Zone 2.
- We know that either Tiao or Udall works in Zone 2, so Udall works in Zone 3.
- We know that Stuckey and Udall work in the same sales zone as each other, so Stuckey also works in Zone 3.
- We know that Parra and Quinn work in the same sales zone as each other, but we don't know which zone that is.
- Kim and Mahr are the only sales representatives left, so one of them works in Zone 1 and the other works in the same zone as Parra and Quinn.
- Since there are more sales representatives working in Zone 3 than in Zone 2, and we already have Stuckey and Udall in Zone 3, then Parra, Quinn, and one other sales representative must also work in Zone 3.
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is E: Udall works in Zone 3.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 63 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: On the first day of a two-day study for a cycling magazine, four riders—Reynaldo, Seamus, Theresa, and Yuki—will each test one of four bicycles—F, G, H, and J. Each rider will then test a different one of the bicycles on the second day. Each rider tests only one bicycle per day, and all four bicycles are tested each day. The assignment of riders to bicycles is subject to the following conditions: Reynaldo cannot test F. Yuki cannot test J. Theresa must be one of the testers for H. The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
Question: If Theresa tests J on the first day, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day.
  B: Seamus tests H on the first day.
  C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
  D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
  E: Theresa is one of the testers for G.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the other three bicycles F, G, and H must be tested by Reynaldo, Seamus, and Yuki, though not necessarily in that order.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test either G or H.
  Yuki cannot test J, so she must test either F or H.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so she cannot test F or J.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus must test either F or G on the first day.
  Possible scenarios:
    1. Seamus tests F on the first day and Yuki tests H on the first day. Reynaldo tests G on the second day and Theresa tests J on the second day.
    2. Seamus tests G on the first day and Yuki tests F on the first day. Reynaldo tests H on the second day and Theresa tests J on the second day.
  The only choice that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day (H) on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test H on the first day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Theresa cannot test F or J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F. Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  The remaining bicycle, F, must be tested by Seamus on the first day.
  Therefore, Seamus is one of the testers for F.
  On the second day, Reynaldo cannot test G, Seamus cannot test H, Theresa cannot test J, and Yuki cannot test H.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test J, Seamus must test G, Theresa must test F, and Yuki must test H on the second day.
  The only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Yuki cannot test J, so Yuki must test F, G, or H on the first day.
  Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the second day. So, Seamus must test F, G, or H on the second day.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H. So, Reynaldo must test F or J on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test J on the first day because Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tests on the second day.
  If Reynaldo tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test F on the second day.
  If Reynaldo tests F on the first day, then Seamus must test H on the second day.
  Therefore, the only possible choice is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus will test H on the first day because Yuki cannot test J and Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki will test F on the first day because Reynaldo cannot test F. 
  Reynaldo will test G on the first day because he cannot test F and the other bicycles are already assigned.
  Seamus will test either F or G on the second day because Yuki will test H and Reynaldo will test J.
  If Seamus tests F on the second day, then Yuki will test G and Reynaldo will test H.
  If Seamus tests G on the second day, then Yuki will test J and Reynaldo will test F.
  Therefore, Yuki could test J on the second day.
  The answer is D: Seamus is one of the testers for J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then the assignments for the first day are as follows:
    Reynaldo, Seamus, Yuki will test F, G, H in some order.
  From the conditions, we know that Theresa must be one of the testers for H, and the bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day. 
  Therefore, on the second day, Seamus must test J and Reynaldo must test G.
  Now we can check the choices to see which one is possible:
    A: Reynaldo tests G on the second day. - This is possible, as Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
    B: Seamus tests H on the first day. - This is not possible, as Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
    C: Yuki tests H on the second day. - This is not possible, as Yuki cannot test J.
    D: Seamus is one of the testers for J. - This is possible, as Seamus must test J on the second day.
    E: Theresa is one of the testers for G. - This is not possible, as Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
  Therefore, the answer is either A or D.
Action: Answer("A or D")
Response 5:
Thought:
- Theresa tests J on the first day
- Reynaldo cannot test F, so he can test G or H on the first day
- Yuki cannot test J, so she can test F, G, or H on the first day
- Theresa must test H, so Seamus must test either F or G on the first day
- The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day, so Seamus must test either F or G on the second day
- From the above conditions, we can conclude that Seamus cannot test H on the first day
- Therefore, Seamus cannot be one of the testers for J on the first day
- If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki must test H on the first day
- From the above conditions, we can conclude that Seamus must test G on the second day
- Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Theresa tests J on the first day.
  Reynaldo cannot test F.
  Yuki cannot test J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H.
  The bicycle that Yuki tests on the first day must be tested by Seamus on the second day.
  Therefore, Reynaldo must test G on the first day.
  Yuki must test either F or H on the first day. But, if Yuki tests F, then Seamus must test H on the second day, which violates the condition that Theresa must be one of the testers for H. Therefore, Yuki must test H on the first day, and Seamus must test F on the second day.
  From the above deductions, we can conclude that Seamus cannot test H on the first day, and Theresa cannot be one of the testers for G. But, Seamus can test J on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then on the second day, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day.
  Theresa must test H.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test G or J.
  Therefore, Seamus cannot test J on the second day because Yuki cannot test J on the first day.
  Seamus cannot test H on the first day because Theresa must test H.
  Therefore, Seamus must test F on the first day.
  On the second day, Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day, which is either G or J.
  Reynaldo cannot test F, so he must test J.
  Therefore, Yuki must test G on the first day and H on the second day.
  The only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day. Therefore, Yuki must test either F, G, or H on the first day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test J on the second day. Therefore, Seamus cannot test F on the first day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test G on the second day. Therefore, Reynaldo must test either F, H, or J on the second day.
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Theresa must test H on the second day.
  The only remaining bicycle for Reynaldo to test is F on the first day.
  The only remaining bicycle for Seamus to test on the first day is G.
  Therefore, the only possible option is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Theresa tests J on the first day, then Seamus must test the bicycle that Yuki tested on the first day on the second day, which is not J.
  Theresa must be one of the testers for H, so H cannot be the bicycle that Theresa tests on the first day.
  Therefore, Theresa must test either F or G on the first day.
  If Theresa tests F on the first day, then Reynaldo cannot test F on the second day, which means Reynaldo must test G on the second day.
  If Reynaldo tests G on the second day, then Seamus cannot test G on the first day.
  So, Seamus must test either H or J on the first day.
  If Seamus tests H on the first day, then Yuki must test J on the first day, which means Seamus must test G on the second day.
  If Seamus tests J on the first day, then Yuki cannot test J on the first day, which means Yuki must test H on the first day and Seamus must test G on the second day.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: Yuki tests H on the second day.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 64 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Of the eight students—George, Helen, Irving, Kyle, Lenore, Nina, Olivia, and Robert—in a seminar, exactly six will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon—according to the following conditions: Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report. Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report. If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
Question: If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by
Choices:
  A: Helen, George, and Nina
  B: Irving, Robert, and Helen
  C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia
  D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  E: Robert, George, and Helen
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the six students who will give oral reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  From the conditions, we know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  Also, neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, Olivia and Robert will give morning reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving will give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  If Nina's report is given on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving will give reports on the next day, which will be Tuesday or Wednesday, respectively.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Helen, George, and Nina.
  The answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left to give reports.
  George must give his report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  Therefore, the only possible combination of students to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is:
  Monday: Helen and Irving
  Tuesday: George and Olivia
  Wednesday: Nina and Robert
  The answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that George has to give his report on Tuesday.
  We know that Olivia and Robert can't give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only two people left to give reports: Nina and either Helen or Irving.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must both give reports on the next day, which means that neither of them can give a morning report on Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, the only possible option for the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We need to determine which three students will give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly two reports will be given each day—one in the morning and one in the afternoon.
  We also know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then there are only six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday or Tuesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports the next day, which means that Nina cannot give a report on Wednesday.
  Therefore, if Nina gives a report, she must give it on Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving do not have to give reports on the same day.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
    - A: Helen, George, and Nina (George can only give a report on Tuesday)
    - B: Irving, Robert, and Helen (Robert cannot give an afternoon report)
    - C: Nina, Helen, and Olivia (If Nina gives a report, she must give it on Wednesday)
    - D: Olivia, Robert, and Irving (Robert cannot give an afternoon report)
    - E: Robert, George, and Helen (George can only give a report on Tuesday)
  The only possible answer is B: Irving, Robert, and Helen.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find three students who can give morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  Tuesday morning is already taken by George.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they are not part of the three students.
  From the given choices, (A) Helen, George, and Nina and (B) Irving, Robert, and Helen include Lenore and Kyle in their answer choices, so they are eliminated.
  (C) Nina, Helen, and Olivia does not include George, so it is also eliminated.
  (D) Olivia, Robert, and Irving and (E) Robert, George, and Helen both include George and Robert, who are already assigned to Tuesday and cannot give an afternoon report, so they are also eliminated.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We are given that exactly 6 students will give reports over three consecutive days.
  We are also given that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We are given that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by:
    - If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they must be two of the students who do not give reports.
    - Therefore, the students who give reports are George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
    - Since George can only give a report on Tuesday, he cannot give a morning report on Monday or Wednesday.
    - Since Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports, they must give morning reports.
    - If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must give reports on the next day unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
    - Since we know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then the remaining three students who do not give reports are Helen, Irving, and either Nina or Olivia.
    - Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday could be given by:
      - Monday: Helen and Nina
      - Tuesday: George and Robert
      - Wednesday: Irving and Olivia
  Therefore, the answer is A: Helen, George, and Nina.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We need to determine who could give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that exactly six students will give individual oral reports during three consecutive days.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students left: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We know that Tuesday is the only day on which George can give a report.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then they cannot be part of the answer.
  Let's try to eliminate choices that are impossible.
  Choice A: If Helen, George, and Nina give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then we have no one left to give the afternoon reports on Monday and Wednesday, which is impossible. Eliminate A.
  Choice B: If Irving, Robert, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then we have Nina, Olivia, and George left to give the afternoon reports, which is possible. Keep B for now.
  Choice C: If Nina, Helen, and Olivia give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then we have George, Irving, and Robert left to give the afternoon reports, which is possible. Keep C for now.
  Choice D: If Olivia, Robert, and Irving give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then we have George, Helen, and Nina left to give the afternoon reports, which is possible. Keep D for now.
  Choice E: If Robert, George, and Helen give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday respectively, then we have Nina, Olivia, and Irving left to give the afternoon reports, which is possible. Keep E for now.
  Choices B, C, D, and E are all possible.
  Therefore, the answer is either B, C, D, or E. We need more information to determine the correct answer.
Action: None of the above.
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that Tuesday is the only day George can give a report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have six students remaining: George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert.
  We have to pick three students to give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively.
  If Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday. This means that Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  Therefore, Nina must give a report on Wednesday.
  Since Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, we have to pick three students from the remaining five to give the morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports. Therefore, they must give morning reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  This means that George and Helen must give morning reports on Wednesday.
  Therefore, the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, respectively, could be given by Robert, Olivia, and George.
  The answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that neither Olivia nor Robert can give an afternoon report.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, then we have 6 students left (George, Helen, Irving, Nina, Olivia, and Robert) to fit into the 4 remaining morning report slots.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday, so he cannot give a report on Monday or Wednesday.
  If Nina gives a report, then Helen and Irving must both give reports the next day, so they cannot give reports on the same day as Nina.
  If Olivia gives an afternoon report, then Robert cannot give a report on the same day.
  If we try to fit the students into the slots, we see that the only option that works is:
    Monday morning: Helen and Robert
    Tuesday morning: George and Nina
    Wednesday morning: Irving and Olivia
  Therefore, the answer is E: Robert, George, and Helen. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We need to find which three students will give the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday if Kyle and Lenore do not give reports.
  We know that George can only give a report on Tuesday.
  We know that Olivia and Robert cannot give afternoon reports.
  If Nina gives a report, then on the next day Helen and Irving must both give reports, unless Nina's report is given on Wednesday.
  If we assume that Nina gives a report on Monday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Tuesday.
  But that means that George cannot give a report on Tuesday, which contradicts the given information.
  Therefore, Nina cannot give a report on Monday.
  If Nina gives a report on Wednesday, then Helen and Irving must give reports on Monday and Tuesday.
  That means that George cannot give a report on Tuesday, so he must give a report on Monday.
  We know that Kyle and Lenore do not give reports, so they cannot give morning reports on any day.
  That leaves us with the following possible combinations for the morning reports on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:
    1. Helen, George, and Nina
    2. Irving, Robert, and Helen
    3. Olivia, Robert, and Irving
  Out of these options, only A is possible since we know that Nina cannot give a report on Monday.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 65 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: It is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  B: K and G are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  D: M and H are placed on the same shelf as each other.
  E: H and O are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Response 0:
Thought:
  From the given information, we can deduce the following:
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then F and K must be on the other two shelves, with K on the top and F on the bottom. Then, L and O must be on the middle and bottom shelves, respectively. G and H can be placed on any of the shelves as long as each shelf has at least two books. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf. So, one of the shelves has only one book.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M. So, F and M are on the same shelf. This means that the shelf where F and M are placed has only two books.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. Therefore, the shelf with only one book must be the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F. This means that K and F cannot be on the same shelf. So K and F must be on different shelves.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L. This means that O and L cannot be on the same shelf. So O and L must be on different shelves.
  We can conclude that the shelf where F and M are placed is the middle shelf since the top shelf has only one book and the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then L must be placed on the top shelf, and K and F must be placed on the bottom shelf. This satisfies all the given conditions. Therefore, it is fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on if H and O are placed on the same shelf.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  Therefore, we can deduce that F and M are also on the middle shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  Therefore, K is on the top shelf and F and M are on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, O is on the top shelf and L is on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, G and H are on the bottom shelf.
  We have determined the placement of all the books based on the given conditions, regardless of any other condition.
  Therefore, the answer is any statement that includes only books whose placements have already been determined based on the given conditions.
  The only such statement is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, then the top shelf will be empty, which contradicts the condition that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  If K and G are placed on the same shelf, then K will be placed on the middle or top shelf, which contradicts the condition that K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  If L and F are placed on the same shelf, then O will be placed on the top shelf, which contradicts the condition that O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  If M and H are placed on the same shelf, then there will be no empty shelf, which contradicts the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  If H and O are placed on the same shelf, then there will be no empty shelf, which contradicts the condition that at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  Therefore, none of the conditions will fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can start with that.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so we can put F and M on the same shelf.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so we can put K on the top shelf and F and M on the middle shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so we can put O on the top shelf and L on the bottom shelf.
  We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can put G, H, and I on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the only statement that will fully determine which of the shelves each of the books is placed on is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so it must be either the top and bottom shelves that have more books than the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they must be on either the top or bottom shelves since the middle shelf already has I.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be on the top shelf and L must be on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If I and M are placed on the same shelf, that means they must be on the middle shelf, and we can determine the placement of F and O, which would be on the top and bottom shelves, respectively.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
- We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
- We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
- Therefore, F and M must be placed on the middle shelf.
- We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and F on the middle shelf.
- We know that O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L on the bottom shelf.
- We know that more books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so there must be 3 books on the bottom shelf.
- The only remaining books are G and H.
- None of the choices tell us where G and H are placed.
- Therefore, it is not fully determined which of the shelves each of the books is placed on.
- The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought:
  From the given conditions, we can infer the following:
  - The bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf.
  - I is placed on the middle shelf.
  - K is placed on a higher shelf than F.
  - O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  - F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  We need to determine which of the given options will fully determine which shelf each book is placed on.
  Option A: If I and M are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where the remaining books are placed. This option alone is not sufficient to determine the placement of all books.
  Option B: If K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where the remaining books are placed. This option alone is not sufficient to determine the placement of all books.
  Option C: If L and F are placed on the same shelf, we know that M must also be on the same shelf. This, along with the given conditions, will fully determine the placement of all books.
  Option D: If M and H are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where the remaining books are placed. This option alone is not sufficient to determine the placement of all books.
  Option E: If H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine where the remaining books are placed. This option alone is not sufficient to determine the placement of all books.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other. 
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that there are three shelves.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If we know that I and M are placed on the same shelf, we can determine the placement of F and the other books.
  If we know that K and G are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of I, F, L, M, and O.
  If we know that L and F are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of I, M, K, and O.
  If we know that M and H are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of I, F, K, L, and O.
  If we know that H and O are placed on the same shelf, we cannot determine the placement of I, F, K, L, and M.
  Therefore, the answer is A: I and M are placed on the same shelf as each other.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can place I there.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if we place F on the middle shelf, then M must also be placed on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be placed on the top shelf and F on the middle shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so O must be placed on the top shelf and L on the bottom shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so we can place G and H on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, if M and F are placed on the same shelf, then all the books' placements can be determined.
  The answer is C: L and F are placed on the same shelf as each other.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 68 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An editor will edit seven articles, one at a time. Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife. The order in which the articles are edited is subject to the following conditions: Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. S must be earlier than Y. J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
Question: The order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: H is fourth.
  B: H is sixth.
  C: R is fourth.
  D: R is seventh.
  E: Y is fifth.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to determine the order of the articles.
  There are three finance articles, three nutrition articles, and one wildlife article.
  Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic.
  S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
  S must be earlier than Y.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  Let's start with the options:
    A: H is fourth. We don't know where H is located in the order, so this option doesn't help.
    B: H is sixth. We don't know where H is located in the order, so this option doesn't help.
    C: R is fourth. If R is fourth, then G must be earlier than R. If G is earlier than R, then J must be earlier than G. If J is earlier than G, then the only place for J is first. The three finance articles must be in the order J, G, and H. If R is fourth, then Q must be third. The three nutrition articles must be in the order S, Y, and R. The order of the articles is fully determined. 
    D: R is seventh. If R is seventh, then G must be earlier than R. If G is earlier than R, then J must be earlier than G. If J is earlier than G, then the only place for J is first. The three finance articles must be in the order J, G, and H. If R is seventh, then Q must be sixth and S must be fifth. The three nutrition articles must be in the order S, Y, and Q. However, this violates the condition that S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, this option doesn't work.
    E: Y is fifth. If Y is fifth, then S must be earlier than Y. If S is earlier than Y, then Q must be third. The three nutrition articles must be in the order S, R, and Q. If Q is third, then the three finance articles must be in the order J, G, and H. The order of the articles is fully determined.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or E. However, option E violates the condition that S must be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, the correct answer is C: R is fourth. 

Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to create a chart of possible orders.
  We know that S must be earlier than Y, so S cannot be seventh.
  We know that J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R, so J must be first, second, or third and R must be fifth, sixth, or seventh.
  We know that Q must be third if S is earlier than Q.
  If H is fourth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, S, R.
  If H is sixth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be R, S, Q.
  If R is fourth, then the order of the finance articles must be G, J, H.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the finance articles must be H, G, J.
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the nutrition articles must be Q, S, Y, R.
  Therefore, the only option that fully determines the order is D: R is seventh.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
To determine the order in which the articles are edited, we need to apply the conditions given in the context. 
We know that:
- Three of the articles—G, H, and J—cover finance; three other articles—Q, R, and S—cover nutrition; and the remaining article, Y, covers wildlife.
- Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other.
- S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third.
- S must be earlier than Y.
- J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.

If H is fourth, we do not know the order of the first three articles, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, A is not the answer.

If H is sixth, we do not know the order of the first five articles, so we cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, B is not the answer.

If R is fourth, the first three articles must be Q, S, and Y in that order. Since S must be earlier than Y, the fourth article cannot be Y. Therefore, the fourth article must be G, and the order of the remaining articles is J, H, and R. Thus, the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined. Therefore, C is the answer.

If R is seventh, we only know that the first three articles are Q, S, and Y in that order. We cannot determine the order of the remaining articles. Therefore, D is not the answer.

If Y is fifth, we know that the fourth article must be S. However, we do not know the order of the first three articles or the order of the last two articles. Therefore, E is not the answer.

Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, that means the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, which cover nutrition. The fourth article, H, covers finance. This means that the fifth article must be Y, which covers wildlife. However, we don't know the order of the last two articles, J and G, which also cover finance. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, that means the first five articles must be Q, R, S, Y, and J, in that order. However, we don't know the order of the last article, G, which also covers finance. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, that means the first three articles must be S, Y, and J, in that order. The fourth article, R, covers nutrition. Therefore, the fifth article must be G, which covers finance. The sixth article must be Q, which covers nutrition. Finally, the seventh article must be H, which covers finance. Therefore, the order is fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, that means the first six articles must be S, Y, J, G, Q, and H, in that order. Therefore, the order is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, that means the first four articles must be S, J, G, and R, in some order. However, we don't know the order of the last three articles, Q, H, and Y. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if Y is fifth.
  
  The only answer choice that leads to a fully determined order is C: R is fourth.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to find the condition that fully determines the order in which the articles are edited.
  If H is fourth, it means the first three articles cannot cover finance, but we still do not know the order of the other articles.
  If H is sixth, it means the first five articles cannot cover finance or nutrition, but we still do not know the order of the remaining articles.
  If R is fourth, it means G must be first, J must be second, and H must be third. We still do not know the order of the remaining articles.
  If R is seventh, it means S must be fourth, Q must be third, and R must be sixth. We still do not know the order of the remaining articles.
  If Y is fifth, it means S must be third and Q must be fourth. G must be first, J must be second, H must be sixth, and R must be seventh. The order is fully determined.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to find the condition that can fully determine the order of the articles.
  From the conditions given, we know that S must be earlier than Y, and J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R.
  If H is fourth, then G and J cannot be second and third, so they must be first and second in some order. Then, R and S must be sixth and seventh in some order, and Y must be fifth. However, we do not know whether Q is third or whether it is fourth. Therefore, the order is not fully determined if H is fourth.
  If H is sixth, then G and J must be first and second in some order, and R and S must be fourth and fifth in some order. Then, Q must be third and Y must be seventh. Therefore, the order is fully determined if H is sixth.
  If R is fourth, then G and J must be first and second in some order, and S and Q must be fifth and sixth in some order. Then, Y must be seventh, and H must be third. Therefore, the order is fully determined if R is fourth.
  If R is seventh, then G and J must be first and second in some order, and S and Q must be third and fourth in some order. Then, H must be fifth and Y must be sixth. Therefore, the order is fully determined if R is seventh.
  If Y is fifth, then S must be first, Q must be third, and R must be seventh. Then, G and J must be second and fourth in some order, and H must be sixth. Therefore, the order is fully determined if Y is fifth.
  The only condition that fully determines the order of the articles is if H is sixth.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We can start by using the given conditions to create a list of possible orderings:
  
  1. S _ _ _ _ _ _
  2. Q _ _ S _ _ _ _
  3. Q _ _ _ S _ _ _
  4. Q _ _ _ _ S _ _
  5. Q _ _ _ _ _ S _
  
  We can then use the remaining conditions to eliminate some of these possibilities:
  
  - J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means that J, G, and R must appear in that order, in any of the above possibilities where they are present.
  
  - Consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic as each other. This means that if one of the finance articles (G, H, J) appears in a given position, the next article cannot be another finance article.
  
  - S must be earlier than Y. This means that any possibility where Y appears before S can be eliminated.
  
  Using these conditions, we can eliminate possibilities 1 and 2, since they violate the condition that consecutive articles cannot cover the same topic. We can also eliminate possibility 5, since it violates the condition that S must be earlier than Y. This leaves us with two possibilities:
  
  3. Q _ _ _ S _ _ _
  4. Q _ _ _ _ S _ _
  
  Now we can use the remaining conditions to determine which of these possibilities is correct:
  
  - If H is fourth, then the only remaining position for G is seventh. This means that R must be sixth, which violates the condition that G must be earlier than R. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.
  
  - If H is sixth, then the only remaining position for J is fourth. This means that G must be fifth and R must be seventh. This satisfies all of the given conditions, so the order in which the articles are edited is fully determined if H is sixth.
  
  - If R is fourth, then the only remaining position for J is second. This means that G must be third and S must be fifth. This violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.
  
  - If R is seventh, then the only remaining position for J is fifth. This means that G must be sixth and S must be fourth. This violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.
  
  - If Y is fifth, then the only remaining position for S is seventh. This means that Q must be third, which violates the condition that S can be earlier than Q only if Q is third. Therefore, this possibility is not valid.
  
  The only valid possibility is 4. Q _ _ _ _ S _ _, which means that the order in which the articles are edited is: Q, H, J, G, S, Y, R.
  
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.
Response 7:
Thought:
  We need to find a condition that fully determines the order of the articles.
  We can start by using the given conditions to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If H is fourth, we don't know which article comes after it, so it doesn't fully determine the order.
  If H is sixth, we still don't know which article comes before it, so it doesn't fully determine the order.
  If R is fourth, we don't know which articles come before or after it, so it doesn't fully determine the order.
  If Y is fifth, we can determine that S must be first, followed by Q, then Y, and then the remaining articles in any order.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Y is fifth.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We know that S must be earlier than Y, and G must be earlier than R.
  We also know that the articles must be edited in a way that prevents consecutive articles from covering the same topic.
  If H is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the last four articles must be G, H, J, and Y, in that order.
  If H is sixth, then the first three articles must be Q, R, and S, and the last four articles must be Y, G, J, and H, in that order.
  If R is fourth, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and R, and the last four articles must be G, J, H, and Y, in that order.
  If R is seventh, then the first three articles must be Q, S, and R, and the last four articles must be G, J, H, and Y, in that order.
  If Y is fifth, then the first four articles must be Q, S, R, and G, and the last three articles must be J, H, and Y, in that order.
  Only option C satisfies the given conditions and fully determines the order in which the articles are edited.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  S must be earlier than Y. This means S cannot be the seventh article.
  J must be earlier than G, and G must be earlier than R. This means R cannot be the first article.
  If Q is third, then S can be earlier than Q. This means Q cannot be the first or second article.
  There are three finance articles and three nutrition articles. This means the order of the first six articles must be FNFNNF or NFNFFN. 
  If H is fourth, then the order of the first four articles must be FNFH or NFNH. Then, the fifth article cannot be an article of the same topic as H. However, there is only one nutrition article left, so this is impossible. 
  If H is sixth, then the order of the first six articles must be FNFNNH or NFNFFH. Then, the seventh article must be Y. This is possible because S is earlier than Y. 
  If R is fourth, then the order of the first four articles must be FNFR or NFNR. Then, the fifth article cannot be an article of the same topic as R. However, there is only one finance article left, so this is impossible.
  If R is seventh, then the order of the first six articles must be NFNFFN. Then, the seventh article must be Y. This is possible because S is earlier than Y. 
  If Y is fifth, then the order of the first four articles must be FNFNS or NFNQS. Then, the fifth article cannot be an article of the same topic as S. However, there is only one finance article left, so this is impossible.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H is sixth.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 69 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Exactly eight books—F, G, H, I, K, L, M, O—are placed on a bookcase with exactly three shelves—the top shelf, the middle shelf, and the bottom shelf. At least two books are placed on each shelf. The following conditions must apply: More of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf. I is placed on the middle shelf. K is placed on a higher shelf than F. O is placed on a higher shelf than L. F is placed on the same shelf as M.
Question: If G is placed on the top shelf, then which one of the following could be a complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf?
Choices:
  A: H, I
  B: I, L
  C: H, I, L
  D: I, K, L
  E: F, I, M
Response 0:
Thought:
If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf. Therefore, G is not placed on the bottom shelf. 
I is placed on the middle shelf, so G is not placed on the middle shelf. 
K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so G cannot be placed on the same shelf as K. 
O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so G cannot be placed on the same shelf as O or L. 
F is placed on the same shelf as M, so G cannot be placed on the same shelf as F or M. 
Therefore, G must be placed on the top shelf along with another book. 
Since H, I, K, L, and O are already placed on other shelves, the only book left to be placed with G on the top shelf is book J. 
Therefore, the middle shelf would have books I and L. 
The answer is B: I, L.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We also know that F is placed on the same shelf as M.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then O must be placed on the bottom shelf and more books must be placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only possible books that could be placed on the middle shelf are H, I, and L.
  The answer is C: H, I, L.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If G is on the top shelf, then we know that H and I must be on the bottom or middle shelf.
  We know that I is on the middle shelf, so H must be on the bottom shelf.
  We also know that F is on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the middle shelf, then M cannot be on the middle shelf either.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is not on the middle shelf, then K must be on the top shelf and O must be on the middle shelf or the bottom shelf.
  If O is on the bottom shelf, then L must be on the middle shelf. This would mean that the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, L.
  If O is on the middle shelf, then L must be on the top shelf. This would mean that the complete and accurate list of books placed on the middle shelf is I, K.
  Therefore, the answer is either D: I, K, L or B: I, L.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F, H, I, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be placed on the bottom shelf.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so G cannot be placed on the top shelf.
  Therefore, it is not possible for G to be placed on the top shelf.
  None of the answer choices are correct.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the bottom shelf has more books than the top shelf, and at least two books are placed on each shelf.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so the top shelf has at most one book.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so if F is not on the top shelf, then M cannot be on the top shelf either.
  If K is on a higher shelf than F, and F is not on the top shelf, then K cannot be on the top shelf either.
  If O is on a higher shelf than L, and L is not on the top shelf, then O cannot be on the top shelf either.
  Therefore, G, F, M, and O must be on the bottom shelf.
  And H, I, K, and L must be on the middle shelf.
  The answer is D: I, K, L.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then at least two books are placed on each shelf, and more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, then:
  The bottom shelf contains at least four books.
  The middle shelf contains at least two books.
  The top shelf contains two books.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so we can eliminate A and E.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so F and K cannot be on the same shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be on the top shelf.
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then F cannot be on the top shelf.
  Therefore, F is on the bottom or middle shelf.
  If F is on the bottom shelf, then K is on the middle or top shelf, and O is on the top shelf, which violates the condition that more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  Therefore, F is on the middle shelf.
  If F is on the middle shelf, then K is on the top shelf and O is on the top shelf.
  The remaining books, G, H, and L, are on the bottom shelf.
  Therefore, the complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is I, F.
  The answer is E: F, I, M.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books must be placed on the middle and bottom shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so it cannot be placed on the top or bottom shelves.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K cannot be placed on the bottom shelf if F is on the same shelf as M.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L cannot be placed on the top shelf if O is on the middle or bottom shelf.
  If F and M are on the same shelf, then they cannot both be on the middle or bottom shelves.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that F and M are on the top shelf with G, and the remaining books (H, I, K, L, O) are on the middle and bottom shelves.
  The only option that includes I and does not violate any of the given conditions is A: H, I.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If G is placed on the top shelf, then the remaining books (F, H, I, K, L, M, O) are placed on the bottom two shelves.
  I is placed on the middle shelf, so the remaining books (F, H, K, L, M, O) are placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so they both must be on the bottom shelf.
  O is placed on a higher shelf than L, so L must be on the bottom shelf and O must be on the middle shelf.
  K is placed on a higher shelf than F, so K must be on the top shelf and F must be on the middle shelf.
  Therefore, the only book that could be on the middle shelf with I is H.
  The answer is A: H, I.

  I is placed on the middle shelf, so H, K, L, M, and O are placed on the bottom shelf.
  F is placed on the same shelf as M, so F must be on the bottom shelf as well.
  More books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf, so the top shelf can only have two books.
  Therefore, G must be on the top shelf with either H or L.
  If G is with H, then the middle shelf would have I and L, which violates the condition that O must be on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, G must be with L, and the middle shelf would have I and H.
  The complete and accurate list of the books placed on the middle shelf is H, I, and G.
  The answer is None of the above.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that if G is placed on the top shelf, then more of the books are placed on the bottom shelf than the top shelf.
  We know that I is placed on the middle shelf.
  We know that F is placed on the same shelf as M. Therefore, F and M must be on the same shelf as I.
  If G is on the top shelf, then K and O must be on the bottom two shelves.
  We know that K is placed on a higher shelf than F and O is placed on a higher shelf than L.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the conditions is D: I, K, L.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 70 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: During the weeklong grand opening of a new antique shop, the antique dealer will auction exactly one antique per day for six consecutive days—June 1st through June 6th. The antiques to be auctioned are: a harmonica, a lamp, a mirror, a sundial, a table, and a vase. The following conditions apply: The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase. The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
Question: If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
  B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial cannot be auctioned on June 2nd, 3rd, or 4th because the mirror and the vase would have to be auctioned before the sundial.
  Since the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both, the table cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  Since the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th, the table cannot be auctioned on June 6th as well.
  Therefore, the table must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 3rd or June 4th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 2nd in some order.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th, then the mirror and the vase must be auctioned on June 1st and June 3rd in some order.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the table, and the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the mirror and the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then it cannot be auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  Therefore, C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial cannot be true.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 1st, then the table cannot be auctioned on a date that is later than both the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table cannot be true.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then it must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror and the vase cannot be auctioned on a date that is later than the table.
  Therefore, B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp cannot be true.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the mirror is auctioned on June 1st, then the table cannot be auctioned on a date that is later than the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase could be true.
  If the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, or June 5th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the table cannot be auctioned on a date that is later than both the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, E: The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp cannot be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, so it must be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase, so the mirror and vase must be auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both. If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  The only option that could be true is that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
  Therefore, the answer is C: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  The table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd or June 3rd.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the mirror must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  The only choice that could be true is B: The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table is either auctioned on June 4th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th. This means that the mirror and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, but we don't know the order. The lamp must be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the only item left is the harmonica, which must be auctioned on June 5th, which satisfies the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the answer cannot be A.
  If the table is auctioned on June 6th, then the harmonica and the vase must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th. This means that the mirror and the sundial must be auctioned on June 2nd and June 3rd, but we don't know the order. The lamp must be auctioned on June 1st. Therefore, the only item left is the vase, which must be auctioned on June 4th or June 5th, which satisfies the condition that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. This means that the answer could be D.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the sundial must be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies the condition that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st. This means that the answer cannot be C or E.
  If the table is auctioned on June 4th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 1st, which satisfies the condition that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp. This means that the answer cannot be B.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  Therefore, the harmonica is auctioned on a date that is later than the date on which the table is auctioned.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  From the above, we can conclude that the lamp cannot be auctioned on June 1st.
  Thus, the lamp can only be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the sundial.
  The sundial can only be auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the sundial is auctioned on June 2nd, then the harmonica must be auctioned on June 1st, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the sundial is auctioned on a later date than the harmonica.
  From the above, we can conclude that the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on a later date than the vase.
  From the above, we can conclude that the vase is auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the vase is auctioned on June 1st, then the mirror must be auctioned on June 2nd, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the vase is auctioned on June 2nd.
  From the above, we can conclude that the mirror is auctioned on June 3rd, June 4th, June 5th, or June 6th.
  The only option that could be true is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  Therefore, the answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  We are given that the table is auctioned on a date later than the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We need to determine which statement could be true based on this condition.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, then the table cannot be auctioned earlier than the vase because the table is auctioned either earlier than the vase or earlier than the harmonica, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the table cannot be auctioned later than the vase because the table is auctioned either earlier than the vase or earlier than the lamp, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the sundial cannot be auctioned earlier than the mirror because the sundial is auctioned earlier than the mirror and also earlier than the vase.
  If the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the table cannot be auctioned later than the vase because the table is auctioned either earlier than the vase or earlier than the mirror, but not both.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is that the mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  The answer is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned.
  We also know that the sundial is not auctioned on June 1st, and that the sundial is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and also on an earlier date than the vase.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, then the vase cannot be auctioned on June 1st or June 2nd.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica, then the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, then the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that the harmonica is auctioned on June 2nd, the lamp is auctioned on June 3rd, the vase is auctioned on June 4th, the mirror is auctioned on June 5th, the table is auctioned on June 6th, and the sundial is not auctioned.
  From this, we can see that Choice A is true, and the answer is A: The harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  The table is auctioned on an earlier date than the harmonica or on an earlier date than the vase, but not both.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on June 5th or June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on June 5th or June 6th, then the vase and the mirror must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, June 3rd, or June 4th.
  The harmonica must be auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp if the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp.
  The sundial is not auctioned on June 1st and is auctioned on an earlier date than the mirror and the vase.
  Therefore, the harmonica cannot be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 4th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  If the harmonica is auctioned on June 5th, then the lamp must be auctioned on June 6th.
  Therefore, the lamp is auctioned on June 6th.
  If the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, then the table must be auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase, which means the vase is auctioned on June 1st, June 2nd, or June 3rd.
  Therefore, the mirror is also auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
  The only possible choice is D: The mirror is auctioned on an earlier date than the vase.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We know that the table is auctioned after both the mirror and the vase.
  We also know that the table is auctioned before either the harmonica or the vase.
  Therefore, the order of the auctions must be: (1) sundial, (2) mirror, (3) vase, (4) table, (5) harmonica, (6) lamp.
  If the table is auctioned on a date that is later than both the date on which the mirror is auctioned and the date on which the vase is auctioned, then the table must be auctioned on the 4th, 5th, or 6th day.
  If the table is auctioned on the 4th day, then the order of the auctions would be: (1) sundial, (2) mirror, (3) vase, (4) table, (5) harmonica, (6) lamp. This would mean that the harmonica is auctioned on an earlier date than the table, which is not possible.
  If the table is auctioned on the 5th day, then the order of the auctions would be: (1) sundial, (2) mirror, (3) vase, (5) table, (4) harmonica, (6) lamp. This means that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the lamp, so B is a possible answer.
  If the table is auctioned on the 6th day, then the order of the auctions would be: (1) sundial, (2) mirror, (3) vase, (6) table, (4) harmonica, (5) lamp. This means that the table is auctioned on an earlier date than the sundial, so C is a possible answer.
  Therefore, B and C are both possible answers.

  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so it cannot be in space 4 or space 6.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 2 or space 7.
  If the toy store is in space 2, then the optometrist must be in space 3 and one of the restaurants must be in space 4, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 7.
  The shoe store must be in space 4 because the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the shoe store is in space 4 and a restaurant is in space 1.
  The answer is C: A restaurant is in space 4.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 72 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
Question: Which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We need to find a statement that must be true.
  We can eliminate A since it only talks about forest and not the other colors.
  We can eliminate B since it only talks about turquoise and not the other colors.
  We can eliminate D since it contradicts the rule that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  We can eliminate E since yellow might not be used in any of the rugs.
  That leaves us with C.
  If peach is not used in any of the rugs, then olive cannot be used in any of the rugs either.
  But olive must be used in one of the rugs since it is a condition.
  Therefore, peach must be used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Let's go through each choice to see which one must be true:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
    - We don't know if forest is used in any of the rugs, let alone multicolored rugs. This choice is not valid.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
    - If turquoise is used in a multicolored rug, it cannot be used with forest or peach. It also cannot be used with yellow or olive (since peach and olive must be used together). Therefore, this choice is true.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
    - This choice is not necessarily true. While it is possible that peach is used in one of the rugs, we cannot deduce this from the given rules.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
    - This choice is not necessarily true. While it is possible that turquoise is used in one of the rugs, we cannot deduce this from the given rules.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
    - This choice is not necessarily true. While it is possible that yellow is used in one of the rugs, we cannot deduce this from the given rules.
  Therefore, the answer is B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Let's check each option:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
     This statement is not true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug with four other colors.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
     This statement is not true because turquoise can be used in a multicolored rug with four other colors.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is true because olive must be used with peach in a rug, and peach is not used with turquoise or yellow.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not true because turquoise cannot be used with forest or peach.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not necessarily true because yellow can be used in a rug with forest, olive, peach, or turquoise.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  We know that five colors are used to weave the rugs.
  We know that white cannot be used alone in any rug. Therefore, if white is used, two other colors must be used with it.
  We know that olive cannot be used without peach.
  We know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  We know that peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  We know that peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  Now, let's go through each answer choice:
  A: There are no multicolored rugs in which forest is used.
     This statement is not necessarily true. Forest can be used in a multicolored rug as long as it is not used with turquoise.
  B: There are no multicolored rugs in which turquoise is used.
     This statement is true. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug because it cannot be used with either forest or peach.
  C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is true. Peach must be used in one of the rugs because it is required when olive is used.
  D: Turquoise is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is false. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug, and it cannot be used with forest or peach in a solid rug.
  E: Yellow is used in one of the rugs.
     This statement is not necessarily true. Yellow may or may not be used in the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Response 4:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true based on the given rules.
  Statement A is not necessarily true because forest can be used in a multicolored rug with other colors.
  Statement B is true because turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug according to the given rules.
  Statement C is true because peach is used in any rug where olive is used, and olive must be used in one of the rugs.
  Statement D is not necessarily true because turquoise cannot be used in a rug with peach, and peach may be used in all three rugs.
  Statement E is not necessarily true because yellow may not be used at all based on the given rules.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to look for a statement that can be deduced from the given rules.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Peach is used in one of the rugs must be true because if olive is used in a rug, peach must also be used in that rug.
  The other statements cannot be deduced from the given rules.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The answer must be a statement that is definitely true based on the given rules.
  If white is used, two other colors are also used. This means white cannot be the only color used in a rug.
  If olive is used, peach is also used. This means olive and peach must be used together in a rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Based on the given rules, the following must be true:
    - White cannot be the only color used in a multicolored rug.
    - Olive and peach are used together in a rug.
    - Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
    - Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  The answer must be one of the above statements.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the rules to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  From the rule that forest and turquoise are not used together, we can eliminate option A and B.
  From the rule that peach cannot be used with turquoise and yellow, we can eliminate option D and E.
  From the rule that olive must be used with peach, we can conclude that peach must be used in a multicolored rug.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that Peach is used in one of the rugs.
  The answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement must be true.
  We know that exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  We know that each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs.
  We know that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  We know that in any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  We know that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  We know that peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  We know that peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Statement A cannot be true since forest can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement B cannot be true since turquoise can be used in a solid-colored rug.
  Statement C must be true since peach is used in the rule for olive thread.
  Statement D cannot be true since peach cannot be used with turquoise.
  Statement E cannot be true since peach cannot be used with yellow.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Peach is used in one of the rugs.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  To find the answer, we need to analyze each statement.
  A: We do not know this for sure. Forest may be used in a multicolored rug.
  B: This statement is true. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug because it cannot be used with forest, peach, or yellow.
  C: This statement is true. Peach must be used in any rug in which olive is used, and olive must be used in one of the rugs.
  D: This statement is false. Turquoise cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  E: This statement is true. Yellow must be used in any rug in which peach is not used, and peach must be used in one of the rugs.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C. However, since C is more general and applies to any situation, we choose C as the answer.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 73 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four art historians—Farley, Garcia, Holden, and Jiang—will give a series of four public lectures, each lecture on a different topic—lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors. The lectures will be given one at a time, with each art historian giving a lecture on a different one of the topics. The schedule of the lectures is subject to the following constraints: The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be true?
Choices:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture.
Response 0:
Thought:
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture are before the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture is before the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture is before Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  Therefore, if Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, Garcia and Jiang's lectures must be after the oil paintings lecture, which violates the constraints. Therefore, Holden cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Let's try to create a schedule that satisfies all the given constraints:
  Assume that Farley gives the first lecture on oil paintings. Then, Holden must give the second lecture on watercolors, and Garcia must give the third lecture on sculptures. Finally, Jiang must give the last lecture on lithographs.
  Now, let's check each choice to see if it can be true or not:
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. This cannot be true because Farley must give the first lecture on oil paintings.
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This can be true because Garcia can give the third lecture on sculptures.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. This cannot be true because Holden must give the second lecture on watercolors.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. This cannot be true because Farley must give the first lecture on oil paintings.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. This can be true because Holden must give the second lecture on watercolors.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. This cannot be true because Farley must give the first lecture on oil paintings. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Therefore, we can create a timeline to visualize the constraints and determine which options are possible.

|---------|---------|---------|---------|
Holden    Garcia    Jiang     Farley
Oil       Water     Litho     Sculpt

  From the timeline, we can see that the only option that cannot be true is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. 
  Therefore, the answer is A.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian gives a lecture on a different one of the topics.
  We can create a chart to visualize the constraints.
  
  | Lecturer | Lecture Topic | Order |
  |----------|--------------|-------|
  | Farley   |              |       |
  | Garcia   |              |       |
  | Holden   |              |       |
  | Jiang    |              |       |
  
  From the constraints, we can deduce the following:
  1. Farley cannot give the oil paintings lecture.
  2. Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's and Jiang's lectures.
  3. Oil paintings and watercolors lectures must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. This is possible. 
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. This is possible.
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. This is possible.
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. This is not possible since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. This is possible.
  
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. 
  
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four topics: lithographs, oil paintings, sculptures, and watercolors.
  Each art historian will give a lecture on a different topic.
  Let's try to draw a timeline to visualize the constraints:
  
    |-------|-------|-------|-------|
    FP      HO      GW      JL      L
    W       O               S       I

  FP: Farley
  HO: Holden
  GW: Garcia
  JL: Jiang
  L: Lithographs
  W: Watercolors
  O: Oil Paintings
  S: Sculptures

  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be on oil paintings. 
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be on sculptures or watercolors, and Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture cannot be on oil paintings.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture. Therefore, the lithographs lecture must be last.

  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (Cannot be true, since Farley must give his lecture before the oil paintings lecture.)
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Can be true.)
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Cannot be true, since Garcia's lecture must be later than Holden's lecture, and Holden's lecture cannot be on watercolors.)
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (Cannot be true, since Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.)
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Can be true.)

  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. 

Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  There are four lectures on four different topics.
  Therefore, there is only one person who can give each lecture.
  If we assume that the order of the lectures is oil paintings, watercolors, sculptures, and lithographs, then Farley must give the watercolors lecture, Holden must give the oil paintings lecture, Garcia must give the sculptures lecture, and Jiang must give the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, we can check each answer choice against this assumption.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, this would violate the constraint that Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, this would be consistent with the assumed order of the lectures. Therefore, B can be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, this is consistent with the assumed order of the lectures. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, this would violate the constraint that Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  The order of the lectures is Oil paintings, Watercolors, Lithographs, and Sculptures.
  Farley must give the first lecture, and Garcia must give the third lecture.
  Choice A cannot be true because Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture.
  Choice B can be true because sculptures is the last lecture, and any of the four historians can give the lecture.
  Choice C can be true because Garcia can give the watercolors lecture.
  Choice D cannot be true because Holden must give the first lecture.
  Choice E can be true because Jiang can give the second lecture.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given constraints to eliminate some possibilities.
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Therefore, Farley's lecture cannot be on oil paintings.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  Therefore, Holden's lecture cannot be on sculptures, watercolors, or lithographs.
  Oil paintings lecture and watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  Therefore, we can conclude that the lithographs lecture must be last.
  Which means, Farley's lecture must be first.
  Now we can use the given choices to see which one cannot be true.
  A: Farley gives the lithographs lecture. (False, Farley's lecture must be first)
  B: Garcia gives the sculptures lecture. (Possible, not eliminated)
  C: Garcia gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible, not eliminated)
  D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. (False, Holden's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture)
  E: Jiang gives the watercolors lecture. (Possible, not eliminated)
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  One art historian will give a lecture on each of the four topics.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then Holden must give the oil paintings lecture. But Garcia and Jiang's lectures couldn't be scheduled correctly. Therefore, Farley cannot give the lithographs lecture.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture, but it is impossible since there is only one lecture before Garcia's. Therefore, Garcia cannot give the sculptures lecture.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture. Since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, Farley must give the oil paintings lecture. Then, Jiang must give the lithographs lecture. Therefore, C can be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture. Then, Garcia's lecture must be earlier than both Holden's and Jiang's lectures. If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Jiang must give the sculptures lecture, and Farley must give the lithographs lecture. Therefore, D can be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden's lecture must be earlier than Jiang's lecture and Garcia's lecture. Since Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture, Farley must give the oil paintings lecture. Then, Garcia must give the sculptures lecture, and Holden must give the lithographs lecture. Therefore, E can be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Farley's lecture must be earlier than the oil paintings lecture.
  Holden's lecture must be earlier than both Garcia's lecture and Jiang's lecture.
  The oil paintings lecture and the watercolors lecture must both be earlier than the lithographs lecture.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate the choices that cannot be true.
  If Farley gives the lithographs lecture, then the oil paintings lecture must be after the lithographs lecture, which violates the third constraint. Therefore, A cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the sculptures lecture, then Jiang would have to give the watercolors lecture, which violates the second constraint. Therefore, B cannot be true.
  If Garcia gives the watercolors lecture, then Holden would have to give the oil paintings lecture, which violates the second constraint. Therefore, C cannot be true.
  If Holden gives the oil paintings lecture, then Farley would have to give the watercolors lecture, which violates the first constraint. Therefore, D cannot be true.
  If Jiang gives the watercolors lecture, then Garcia would have to give the sculptures lecture, which violates the second constraint. Therefore, E cannot be true.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Holden gives the oil paintings lecture.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 74 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: An author is planning to write a mystery novel consisting of seven chapters, chapter 1 through chapter 7. Each of seven different clues—R, S, T, U, W, X, and Z—is to be mentioned exactly once, one clue per chapter. The order in which the clues are mentioned is subject to the following constraints: T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
Question: If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  B: S is mentioned in chapter 3.
  C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
  D: U is mentioned in chapter 1.
  E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, in some order.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then W must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, which violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4, which also violates the constraint that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which violates the constraint that U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7 (because T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W).
  Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 1 and 2 or in chapters 2 and 3 or in chapters 4 and 5 or in chapters 5 and 6.
  If U and X are mentioned in chapters 1 and 2, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
  If U and X are mentioned in chapters 2 and 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
  If U and X are mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1 and S must be mentioned in chapter 6 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
  If U and X are mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, then R must be mentioned in chapter 1 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4 (because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters).
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6 or T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Also, W must be mentioned in chapter 5 or chapter 6. If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then U must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6 and X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 5, then U must be mentioned in chapter 4 and T must be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 6, then U must be mentioned in chapter 5 and T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 7, then U must be mentioned in chapter 6 and T must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then neither S nor Z can be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5, but that violates the constraint that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 6, then W must be mentioned in chapter 3, but that violates the constraint that T must be mentioned before W.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 3, then X must be mentioned in chapter 4, but that violates the constraint that W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 5 and X must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 2, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3, but that violates the constraint that S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 4, then R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  If S is mentioned in chapter 5, then R must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  Therefore, R must be mentioned in chapter 3 or chapter 5.
  The only choice that satisfies this condition is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Since U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  W must be mentioned after T, with exactly two chapters between them, so W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  Since W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, X must be mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 3 or 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then R must be mentioned in chapter 2 and S must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 4, then S must be mentioned in chapter 2 and R must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, either R or S could be mentioned in chapter 3.
  The answer is A or B.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W. Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 2, 3, or 4, and W must be mentioned in chapter 5, 6, or 7.
  S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, S must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, W must be mentioned in chapter 5, and X must be mentioned in chapter 6 or 7.
  U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters. Therefore, X must be mentioned in chapter 7, and U must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, the only possible order of clues that satisfies all the constraints and has Z mentioned in chapter 7 is: S, T, R, U, W, X, Z.
  Therefore, R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then W cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T is mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, then T cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then X cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, then U cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, we know that neither S nor W can be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that U cannot be mentioned in chapter 7.
  If T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1, we know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  If T must be mentioned before W, and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W, we know that T cannot be mentioned in chapter 3.
  Therefore, T must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If U and X must be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that X must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that W must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters, we know that S must be mentioned in chapter 2 or chapter 4.
  If R has not been mentioned yet, it must be mentioned in chapter 1, 2, or 3.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is C: T is mentioned in chapter 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 6, then T must be mentioned in chapter 4 and X must be mentioned in chapter 5.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 5, then T must be mentioned in chapter 3 and X must be mentioned in chapter 4.
  If W is mentioned in chapter 4, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3, but neither of these options satisfies the condition that there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  Therefore, W can only be mentioned in chapter 6 or 5.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 7, then X must be mentioned in chapter 6.
  If X is mentioned in chapter 6, then W must be mentioned in chapter 5 and T must be mentioned in chapter 3.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then S cannot be mentioned in chapter 2.
  Therefore, the only option that satisfies all the constraints is that R is mentioned in chapter 3.
  The answer is A: R is mentioned in chapter 3.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then it is impossible for W to be mentioned in chapter 7 because T must be mentioned before W and there must be exactly two chapters separating the mention of T from the mention of W.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then it is impossible for S to be mentioned in chapter 6 because S and Z cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then it is impossible for X to be mentioned in chapter 6 because W and X cannot be mentioned in adjacent chapters.
  If Z is mentioned in chapter 7, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 3 because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and it must be mentioned before W.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 2, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 4 and 5, in some order.
  If T is mentioned in chapter 3, then U and X must be mentioned in chapters 5 and 6, in some order.
  If R is mentioned in chapter 3, then T must be mentioned in chapter 2 or 4, which is impossible because T cannot be mentioned in chapter 1 and it must be mentioned before W.
  If U is mentioned in chapter 1, then X must be mentioned in chapter 2, which is impossible because Z is mentioned in chapter 7.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: X is mentioned in chapter 5.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 75 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Four students will be assigned to a history project in which they will search archives from the years 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1924. Each of the four years will have exactly one student assigned to it. Six students—Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, Tiffany, and Yoshio—are available for this project. The following conditions apply: Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
Question: If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
  B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
  C: Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
  E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only five students are available for the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, and the remaining two students must be assigned to 1924 and 1923. This means that Louis and Tiffany cannot both be assigned to 1923, which means that one of them must be assigned to 1924. If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, which means that Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany are available for the project, and the only one of the answer choices that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be only 5 students available for the project.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so if Yoshio is not assigned, then one of them must be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which means Onyx will be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
  Therefore, if Yoshio is not assigned to the project, Louis can be assigned to 1924.
  The answer is E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We need to find a possible situation where Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the remaining students are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, Ryan, and Tiffany.
  Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923. If Tiffany is assigned to 1923, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. Therefore, Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This means that Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. This means that Mollie cannot be assigned to 1923 or 1924. Therefore, Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Louis must be assigned to 1924.
  If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then she cannot be assigned to 1921 or 1922. Therefore, Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1921 or 1922. If Louis is assigned to 1921 or 1922, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923 and Ryan must be assigned to 1924. If Tiffany is assigned to 1921 or 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to the project and Onyx must be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, Onyx can be assigned to 1922. If Mollie is not assigned to the project, then Louis can be assigned to 1921 or 1922, Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, Ryan can be assigned to 1924, and Yoshio can be unassigned.
  This means that A, B, C, and E are not true, but D could be true.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then only 5 students are available for the project.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, he cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to the project and cannot be assigned to 1923.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, but if Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to 1922.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is that Louis is not assigned to the project.
  The answer is A: Louis is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there will be only five students left to assign to the four years.
  The following conditions must be met:
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. However, this would mean that Ryan must also be assigned to the project, which is not possible since there are only four years to assign to the students.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx cannot be assigned to any year. This is because Onyx can only be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, but since Ryan is not assigned to any year, there is no year for Onyx to be assigned to.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. This means that Ryan must also be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. There will be two years left to assign to Mollie and either Louis or Tiffany. Since Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to the remaining year, which is 1924.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Ryan must be assigned to 1923, Tiffany must be assigned to 1924, and Louis must be assigned to 1921. This leaves Mollie unassigned, which is not possible.
  If Louis is assigned to 1924, then Tiffany must be assigned to 1923, Ryan must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Tiffany's, and Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. This leaves Mollie unassigned, which is not possible.
  Therefore, the only possible option is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We need to determine which statement could be true if Yoshio is not assigned to the project.
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then the four students assigned to the project are Louis, Mollie, Onyx, and Ryan.
  From the given conditions, we know that:
    - Only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
    - If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922.
    - If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
    - If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  If Mollie is assigned to 1921, then Louis or Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. But only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923, so Tiffany must be assigned to 1923. Then, Ryan must be assigned to the project, and Onyx must be assigned to 1922. Therefore, the only possible assignment is:
    - Mollie: 1921
    - Tiffany: 1923
    - Ryan: 1924
    - Onyx: 1922
  From the possible assignments, we can see that Louis is not assigned to the project. Therefore, the statement A: Louis is not assigned to the project, could be true.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are only 5 students available for the project.
  The project requires assigning exactly one student to each of the four years.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, leaving only one year for the remaining 4 students.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project, leaving only two years for the remaining 3 students.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, leaving only two years for the remaining 2 students.
  Therefore, Louis and Mollie cannot be assigned to the same year.
  If Louis is assigned to 1923, then Tiffany must be assigned to the project, and Ryan must be assigned to the remaining year, leaving only two years for the remaining 2 students. This is not possible.
  Therefore, Tiffany is not assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Onyx is not assigned to the project, leaving only two years for the remaining 4 students. This is not possible.
  Therefore, Ryan is assigned to the project, and Onyx is assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's, which is 1923.
  Louis cannot be assigned to 1923, so Louis is assigned to 1924 and Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is D: Onyx is assigned to 1922.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there will be five students left to be assigned to the four years.
  Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922, which means either Louis or Tiffany will be assigned to 1923.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's.
  Therefore, the only possible solution is that Louis is not assigned to the project, and Tiffany, Ryan, Onyx, and Mollie are assigned to the project. This means that Ryan is assigned to 1924, Onyx is assigned to 1923, Tiffany is assigned to 1922, and Mollie is assigned to 1921.
  The only option that could be true is B: Ryan is not assigned to the project.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, then there are five students available for the project.
  If Louis is not assigned to the project, then there are four students available for the project.
  If Ryan is not assigned to the project, then Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project because Tiffany can only be assigned if Ryan is assigned.
  If Tiffany is not assigned to the project, then Louis must be assigned to 1923. But this is impossible because only Louis or Tiffany can be assigned to 1923.
  If Onyx is assigned to 1922, then Mollie must be assigned to 1921 because Mollie must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922 if she is assigned to the project.
  Therefore, the only possible option is E: Louis is assigned to 1924.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  If Yoshio is not assigned to the project, there are only 5 students left to be assigned.
  If Louis is assigned to the project, then either Tiffany or Ryan must be assigned to 1923, but neither of them can be assigned to 1923 if Yoshio is not assigned. Therefore, Louis cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Mollie is assigned to the project, then she must be assigned to either 1921 or 1922. However, if Mollie is assigned, then there will only be 3 students left to assign to the remaining 3 years (1923 and 1924 cannot be assigned to Tiffany or Louis). Therefore, Mollie cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Tiffany is assigned to the project, then Ryan must be assigned to the project. However, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project if Yoshio is not assigned. Therefore, Tiffany cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Ryan is assigned to the project, then Onyx must be assigned to the year immediately prior to Ryan's. However, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project if Yoshio is not assigned. Therefore, Ryan cannot be assigned to the project.
  If Louis, Mollie, Tiffany, and Ryan cannot be assigned to the project, then only Onyx can be assigned to 1922. Therefore, Onyx is assigned to 1922 if Yoshio is not assigned.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 76 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A realtor will show a prospective buyer seven houses—J, K, L, M, N, 0, and P—during a single day. The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning; the third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon; the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. The houses will be shown according to the following rules: J must be shown in the evening. K cannot be shown in the morning. L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
Question: Which one of the following could be the order, from first through seventh, in which the realtor shows the houses?
Choices:
  A: K, 0, L, M, N, J, P
  B: N, L, P, K, M, 0, J
  C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
  D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J
  E: P, 0, K, J, L, N, M
Response 0:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K and L must be shown before M, and L must be shown after K.
  The first two houses must be shown in the morning, so neither K nor L can be the first or second house shown.
  N is one of the three houses shown in the afternoon, so N must be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  The order of the seven houses must be in one of the following formats:
    1. morning, morning, afternoon, afternoon, afternoon, evening, evening
    2. morning, morning, afternoon, afternoon, evening, afternoon, evening
  Using these formats, we can eliminate choices A, B, and E because they do not follow the rules.
  The remaining choices are C and D, which both follow the rules.
  Therefore, the answer is either C or D.
Action: Answer("C") or Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is either the sixth or seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is either the third, fourth, or fifth house.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, L is either the fourth or fifth house, and M is either the fifth or sixth house.
  N is either the third or fourth house, and 0 is either the first or second house.
  A possible order is 0, K, N, L, M, P, J.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate answer choices A, C, and E.
  We are left with answer choices B and D.
  In answer choice B, N is shown before K, which violates the rule that K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L must be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  The first and second houses shown must be morning, so the first and second houses cannot be J or K.
  The order of the houses must be: morning-morning-afternoon-afternoon-afternoon-evening-evening.
  Using these rules, we can eliminate options A, B, C, and E.
  Option D follows all the given rules.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth or fifth house shown.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: [morning house], [morning house], K, L, M, N, J or P.
  The first two houses can be any of the remaining houses: 0, J, or P.
  The order of the remaining houses is: K, L, M, N, J or P.
  Based on these rules, the only possible order is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so it must be the sixth or seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so it must be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth house shown.
  Based on the above rules, we can eliminate answer choices A, B, and E.
  In answer choice C, K is shown before L, which violates the rule that L must be shown after K.
  In answer choice D, K is shown before L and M is shown before L, which violates the rule that L must be shown between K and M.
  Therefore, the only possible order is 0, K, L, N, P, M, J.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J is either the sixth or the seventh house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is either the third, fourth, or fifth house shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the order of the houses must be: K, L, M, N, 0, P, J.
  The only option that follows this order is D.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. So, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, 0 and P must be the first two houses shown.
  N can be shown at any time.
  Based on the above reasoning, the only possible order for showing the houses is:
  0, P, K, L, M, N, J
  Therefore, the answer is C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the last house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be the first or last house to be shown.
  Therefore, the only possible order is: 
  Morning: 0, P
  Afternoon: K, L, M
  Evening: N, J
  The answer is C: 0, P, K, L, N, M, J
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J must be the 6th or 7th house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th house shown.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L must be the 4th house shown.
  We know that J is the 6th or 7th house shown, and L is the 4th house shown, so we can start building the order from there.
  We can eliminate choices A and B because they have J shown before L.
  We can eliminate choice C because it has K shown before L.
  We can eliminate choice E because it has P shown before K.
  Therefore, the answer is D: 0, P, M, N, K, L, J.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 77 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A publisher is planning to publish six cookbooks—K, L, M, N, O, and P—over the course of the next year. Each cookbook will be published in one of two seasons—fall or spring—subject to the following conditions: M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. K and N must be published in the same season as each other. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring
Question: If M is published in the fall, which one of the following is a pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M?
Choices:
  A: K and 0
  B: L and N
  C: L and 0
  D: N and P
  E: 0 and P
Response 0:
Thought: 
  M is published in the fall, so N must be published in the spring.
  K and N must be published in the same season as each other.
  Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
  P cannot be published in the same season as M.
  Therefore, P must be published in the spring.
  L cannot be published in the same season as M or P.
  Therefore, L must be published in the fall with K and O.
  The only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, M cannot be published in the same season as N or K.
  Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M must be O and either L or P.
  Therefore, the answer is E: O and P.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K cannot be published in the spring.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall if M is published in the fall.
  This leaves us with the following options for cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M: K and O or L and O.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L and O.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. However, we don't know where O is published yet.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M.
  The remaining cookbooks are K, L, N, and O. If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, L and N must be published in the spring.
  If K is not published in the fall, O can be published in either the fall or the spring. If O is published in the spring, then K must also be published in the spring. Therefore, L and N must be published in the fall.
  Therefore, the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M are L and O.

  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, K and O must both be published in the fall if K is published in the fall.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other. Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M.
  So, the only possible pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
  P cannot be published in the same season as M.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, K and O must both be published in the fall.
  L cannot be published in the fall with M because that would leave P as the only cookbook left to be published in the spring, which is not possible because M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If M is published in the fall, N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, O must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, if M is published in the fall, K cannot be published in the fall.
  Thus, K and N cannot both be published in the fall with M.
  M and P cannot be published in the same season as each other.
  Therefore, P cannot be published in the fall with M.
  This leaves us with two cookbooks: L and O.
  Therefore, L and O could both be published in the fall along with M.
  The answer is C: L and O.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring. Therefore, N cannot be published in the fall with M.
  If K is published in the fall, then O must also be published in the fall. Therefore, if M is published in the fall, K cannot be published in the fall.
  Since K cannot be published in the fall, K and O cannot be the pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is L and 0.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If M is published in the fall, then N must be published in the spring.
  Therefore, K and O must be published in the fall.
  Since K and N must be published in the same season, N must also be published in the fall.
  Therefore, the only pair of cookbooks that could both be published in the fall along with M is K and O.
  The answer is A: K and O.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 78 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At a concert, exactly eight compositions—F, H, L, O, P, R, S, and T—are to be performed exactly once each, consecutively and one composition at a time. The order of their performance must satisfy the following conditions: T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. At least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. O is performed either first or fifth. The eighth composition performed is either L or H. P is performed at some time before S. At least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O.
Question: If S is performed fourth, which one of the following could be an accurate list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively?
Choices:
  A: F, H, P
  B: H, P. L
  C: O, P, R
  D: O, P, T
  E: P, R, T
Response 0:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed before S are O, the first composition, and either F or R.
  From the third condition, we know that O is either first or fifth.
  If O is first, then the compositions performed before S are F or R and then P. This means that T needs to be performed immediately after R or immediately before F. If T is performed immediately before F, then the compositions performed second and third are H and L or L and H. If T is performed immediately after R, then the compositions performed second and third are L and H or H and L. However, we know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, if O is first, then the compositions performed first, second, and third respectively could be H, L, and P or L, H, and P.
  If O is fifth, then the compositions performed before S are F or R and then T. This means that T needs to be performed immediately after R or immediately before F. If T is performed immediately before F, then the compositions performed first, second, and third are O, P, and H or O, P, and L. If T is performed immediately after R, then the compositions performed first, second, and third are O, P, and L or O, P, and H. However, we know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, if O is fifth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third respectively could be O, P, and L or O, P, and H.
  Therefore, the possible lists of compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  - H, L, P or L, H, P if O is first
  - O, P, H or O, P, L if O is fifth
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then we can deduce the following:
    - O must be performed first (from the condition that O is performed either first or fifth)
    - P must be performed second (from the condition that P is performed at some time before S)
    - T must be performed third (from the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R, and we know that S is performed fourth)
  We can eliminate choices B and E because they do not have O performed first. 
  We can eliminate choice D because it has T performed last, which contradicts the condition that L or H must be performed last.
  We can eliminate choice C because it has R performed last, which contradicts the condition that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Therefore, the answer is A: F, H, P.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth, so the order of the first three compositions is unknown.
  O is performed either first or fifth, so if O is first, then P must be second and R must be third.
  If O is fifth, then F must be first and H must be second. 
  We know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R. If R is third and T is after R, then F must be fourth. If R is second and T is before R, then F must be first.
  We know that P is performed at some time before S. If S is fourth, then P must be either first, second, or third.
  From the above deductions, we can see that the only possible order of the first three compositions is O, P, T. 
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third must be one of the following combinations: {F, H, L, O, P, R}, {F, H, O, P, R, T}, {H, L, O, P, R, T}, {O, P, R, S, T, F}, or {O, P, R, T, F, H}.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S.
  If O is performed first, then the compositions performed second and third must be one of the following combinations: {P, R}, {P, T}, {P, F}, or {P, H}.
  If O is performed fifth, then the compositions performed first, second, and third must be one of the following combinations: {F, H, P}, {H, P, L}, {O, P, R}, {O, P, T}, or {P, R, T}.
  Therefore, the answer is either A: F, H, P or B: H, P, L.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If S is performed fourth, then O must be performed first.
  Then, either F or R must be performed second, depending on whether T is performed immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Then, either F or R must be performed third, depending on whether T is performed immediately before F or immediately after R.
  Since P is performed before S, and S is performed fourth, then P must be performed either first, second, or third.
  Therefore, the possible lists of the compositions performed first, second, and third are:
  O, P, F
  O, P, R
  O, F, P
  O, R, P
  The answer is either A, B, or D.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth, and P is performed before S.
  Therefore, the possible orders for the first four compositions are: 
    1) O _ _ P
    2) _ O _ P
    3) P _ O S
    4) S O _ P
    5) P S O _
    6) S _ O P
    7) _ S O P
  Now, we need to find a list of compositions that could be performed first, second, and third, respectively, from the above possible orders.
  From the above orders, we see that the only possible list of compositions that could be performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, P, T.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, then the compositions performed after S and before O must be at least two.
  Therefore, O cannot be performed first.
  O can be performed fifth, and the compositions performed after O and before S can be F, H, L, or R, but not T because T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If the eighth composition performed is L, then P must be performed before S. Therefore, P cannot be performed first because O is performed either first or fifth.
  If the eighth composition performed is H, then P can be performed first, and the compositions performed after O and before S can be F, L, or R.
  The possible accurate list of compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is P, R, T.
  Therefore, the answer is E: P, R, T.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We are given a set of conditions that must be satisfied for the compositions to be performed in a certain order.
  We are asked to find a possible list of compositions if S is performed fourth.
  If S is performed fourth, then we know that P is performed before S.
  We also know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H.
  We are given that O is performed either first or fifth.
  If O is performed first, then the compositions performed after O and before S must be F, H, and either L or H.
  If O is performed fifth, then the compositions performed after S and before O must be F, H, and either L or H.
  We are told that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F.
  If we assume that F is performed before R, then we know that at least two compositions are performed after F and before R.
  We also know that T is performed either immediately before F or immediately after R.
  If we assume that T is performed immediately before F, then R must be performed before T, which means that at least two compositions are performed after R and before F.
  This leaves us with the following possible list of compositions: O, P, T or F, H, L or H.
  Therefore, the answer is D: O, P, T. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If S is performed fourth, we have the following order of compositions: _ _ _ S _ _ _ _ 
  From the given conditions, we know that O is performed either first or fifth. Therefore, if O is performed first, we have the following order: O _ _ S _ _ _ _.
  From the given conditions, we know that P is performed at some time before S, and at least one composition is performed either after O and before S, or after S and before O. Therefore, P must be performed second, and the composition after P must be S. We have the following order: O P S _ _ _ _ _.
  From the given conditions, we know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H. Therefore, the eighth composition cannot be T. If T is performed immediately before F or immediately after R, then F cannot be the eighth composition performed. Therefore, R must be the eighth composition performed. We have the following order: O P S _ _ _ _ R.
  From the given conditions, we know that at least two compositions are performed either after F and before R, or after R and before F. Therefore, there are at least three compositions between P and R. The only composition that can be performed after S and before R is T. Therefore, we have the following order: O P S T _ _ _ R.
  From the given conditions, we know that the order of compositions must satisfy all the given conditions. Therefore, the only possible list of the compositions performed first, second, and third, respectively, is O, P, T.
  The answer is D: O, P, T.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  We know that S is performed fourth.
  This means that O cannot be performed first because if it were, there would be no compositions left to perform after S and before O.
  Therefore, O must be performed fifth.
  We know that the eighth composition performed is either L or H, so P cannot be eighth.
  Since P is performed before S, it cannot be seventh either.
  Therefore, P must be performed either first, second, third, fourth, or sixth.
  If P is performed first, second, or third, then there would be no compositions left to perform after S and before O, so P must be performed fourth or sixth.
  If P is performed sixth, then L or H must be performed first, second, or third, but we don't know which one.
  Therefore, the only possibility is that P is performed fourth, and the compositions performed first, second, and third are L, H, and T in some order.
  This satisfies all of the given conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is B: H, P, L.

Topic: Law
Context: A loading dock consists of exactly six bays numbered 1 through 6 consecutively from one side of the dock to the other. Each bay is holding a different one of exactly six types of cargo—fuel, grain, livestock, machinery, produce, or textiles. The following apply: The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4?
Choices:
  A: grain
  B: livestock
  C: machinery
  D: produce
  E: textiles
Response 0:

  We are given a set of rules and restrictions related to the bays and their respective cargo types.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  We need to determine which one of the following CANNOT be the type of cargo held in bay 4.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding grain because grain is held in a bay with a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding livestock because livestock is held in a bay with a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding produce because produce is held in a bay with a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding textiles because textiles is held in a bay next to the bay holding produce.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that CANNOT be held in bay 4 is machinery.
  The answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  According to the information given:
  - The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  - The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  - The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  - The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  
  We can conclude that:
  - Bay 6 must hold either grain or livestock.
  - Bay 5 must hold either livestock or textiles.
  - Bay 3 must hold either fuel or produce.
  - Bay 2 must hold either produce or textiles.
  - Bay 1 must hold either fuel or machinery.
  
  Therefore, machinery cannot be the type of cargo held in bay 4 because machinery must be in bay 1 or bay 2.
  The answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  We can use the given information to eliminate the choices that could be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock. So, grain cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles. So, livestock cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel. So, produce cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce. So, textiles cannot be held in bay 4.
  Therefore, machinery is the only choice that could be held in bay 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought: 
  We know that there are six types of cargo and six bays numbered 1 through 6.
  We know that the bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  We know that the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  We know that the bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  We know that the bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  We can create a diagram to represent the relationships between the bays and their cargos.
  Bay 1: Fuel
  Bay 2: Textiles
  Bay 3: Produce
  Bay 4: ?
  Bay 5: Livestock
  Bay 6: Grain
  We know that Bay 4 cannot hold textiles, produce, or grain based on the given information.
  We know that Bay 4 cannot hold livestock because the bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, the only option left is machinery.
  The answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Bay 6 is holding textiles.
  Bay 5 is holding produce.
  Bay 4 is holding one of the remaining 4 types of cargo.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  Therefore, fuel is not held in bay 5 or 6.
  Bay 3 is holding fuel.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  Therefore, bay 1, 2, and 3 cannot hold textiles.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  Therefore, livestock is not held in bay 5 or 6.
  Bay 2 is holding livestock.
  Therefore, grain is not held in bay 5 or 6.
  Bay 1 is holding grain.
  Therefore, machinery is held in bay 4.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to create a diagram of the loading dock.
  From the given information, we know that: 
    - Bay 6 cannot hold grain, livestock, or textiles.
    - Bay 1 cannot hold produce or machinery.
    - Bay 2 cannot hold produce or fuel.
    - Bay 3 cannot hold livestock or fuel.
    - Bay 4 cannot hold livestock or produce.
    - Bay 5 cannot hold grain, produce, or machinery.
  Therefore, the type of cargo held in bay 4 cannot be livestock or produce.
  The answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce.
  From the given conditions, we can deduce the following order of bays and cargo:
  Bay 1: fuel
  Bay 2: produce
  Bay 3: textiles
  Bay 4: ???
  Bay 5: livestock
  Bay 6: grain
  Bay 4 cannot hold the same type of cargo as any of the bays next to it, which are bay 3 and bay 5.
  Therefore, the type of cargo that cannot be held in bay 4 is produce, which is already in bay 2.
  The answer is D: produce.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We can use the given information to determine which cargo cannot be held in bay 4.
  The bay holding produce has a higher number than the bay holding fuel, so produce cannot be in bay 1 or 2.
  The bay holding textiles is next to the bay holding produce, so textiles cannot be in bay 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  The bay holding livestock has a higher number than the bay holding textiles, so livestock cannot be in bay 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  The bay holding grain has a higher number than the bay holding livestock, so grain cannot be in bay 1, 2, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the only possible cargo that can be held in bays 1, 2, 5, or 6 is machinery.
  Since each bay holds a different type of cargo, machinery cannot be held in bay 4.
  Therefore, the answer is C: machinery.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding grain or livestock.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding textiles or produce.
  Bay 4 is not the bay holding machinery.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 80 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: At an upcoming exhibition, four art students—Franz, Greene, Hidalgo, and Isaacs—will each display exactly two paintings—an oil and a watercolor. Exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position. The following conditions will apply: No wall has only watercolors displayed on it. No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it. No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it. Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed. Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
Question: If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.

  We know that exactly two paintings will be displayed on each of the walls of the exhibition room—walls 1, 2, 3, and 4—with one painting in the upper position and one in the lower position.
  We know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  We know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall.
  We also know that no wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  This means that Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is E: Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs cannot have any other painting displayed on wall 4.
  Hidalgo cannot have any painting displayed on wall 4 because that would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must both be displayed on walls 1, 2, or 3.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position on the same wall, which would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in a lower position on one of the walls on which Isaacs's watercolor is not displayed.
  This means that Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed in an upper position on one of the walls on which Isaacs's watercolor is not displayed.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed in an upper position on wall 4, which would violate the condition that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in an upper position on wall 4, which means that Isaacs's oil must be displayed in a lower position on wall 4.
  This means that Greene's oil must be displayed in an upper position on the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position. 
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, so Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Greene's oil must be displayed on the same wall as another oil painting.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Greene's oil, and Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall from Isaacs's watercolor.
  This means that Hidalgo's oil is not displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, so D is not true.
  Also, Isaacs's watercolor is not displayed in a lower position, so E is not true.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor cannot be displayed on that wall.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  Since Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then wall 4 will have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Isaacs's watercolor is displayed.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then the wall containing Greene's watercolor will contain Franz's oil.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Franz's oil must be displayed in the upper position of either wall 1, 2, or 3.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's oil and watercolor.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's oil and watercolor.
  Therefore, neither B nor D can be true.
  If Isaacs's watercolor is displayed in a lower position, then Isaacs's oil must be displayed in the upper position of wall 4.
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  Therefore, A must be true.
  The answer is A: Greene's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  Therefore, Greene's oil must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall as Franz's watercolor.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's paintings must be displayed on walls 1 and 2.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  Therefore, Greene's watercolor is displayed in the lower position of the same wall as Franz's oil.
  This means that wall 3 must have the watercolors of both Hidalgo and Isaacs.
  If Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position, then Isaacs's watercolor must be displayed in a lower position on the same wall.
  Therefore, the correct answer is D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position of the same wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4. Therefore, Isaacs cannot have a watercolor displayed on wall 4.
  According to the given conditions, no wall can have only watercolors displayed on it, so Greene's watercolor must be displayed on a different wall than the wall on which Franz's watercolor is displayed.
  Hidalgo cannot have both paintings displayed on the same wall, so if Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on a different wall than Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, if Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed in an upper position.
  The answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that:
    - Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall.
    - Franz's oil is displayed in the lower position of the wall.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has only watercolors displayed on it.
  No wall has the work of only one student displayed on it.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  The only option that must be true is that Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
  The answer is C: Hidalgo's oil is displayed in an upper position.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of the wall on which Franz's oil is displayed.
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Greene's watercolor must be displayed in the lower position.
  Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  No wall has both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it.
  Therefore, the wall on which Greene's oil and Franz's watercolor are displayed cannot be wall 4.
  Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor must be displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Franz's oil and Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then Hidalgo's oil must be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Greene's oil is displayed on the same wall as Franz's watercolor, then we know that Greene's watercolor is displayed in the upper position of that same wall.
  We also know that Isaacs's oil is displayed in the lower position of wall 4.
  Therefore, Isaacs's watercolor cannot be displayed on wall 4.
  If Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall must be either wall 1, 2, or 3.
  However, we know that no wall has only watercolors displayed on it, so Hidalgo's oil must also be displayed on that wall.
  But if Hidalgo's oil is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor, then that wall would have both a painting by Franz and a painting by Isaacs displayed on it, which is not allowed.
  Therefore, Hidalgo's watercolor cannot be displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.
  We don't have any information about the position of Hidalgo's paintings, so we cannot determine whether choice C is true or false.
  Similarly, we don't have any information about the position of Isaacs's watercolor, so we cannot determine whether choice E is true or false.
  Therefore, the only possible answer is B: Hidalgo's watercolor is displayed on the same wall as Isaacs's watercolor.

Topic: Law
Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be
Choices:
  A: the pharmacy and a restaurant
  B: the pharmacy and the toy store
  C: the two restaurants
  D: a restaurant and the toy store
  E: a restaurant and the veterinarian
Response 0:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, we can place them in any of the five central spaces (spaces 2 through 6).
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. If the optometrist is in one of the central spaces, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, one of the restaurants must be in space 2 or 6.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the other restaurant must be in space 4.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian. Therefore, the toy store must be in space 3 or 5.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  The answer is B: the pharmacy and the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are two possible arrangements: optometrist in space 2 and shoe store in space 1 or optometrist in space 6 and shoe store in space 7.
  In the first possible arrangement, the pharmacy must be in space 7, and one of the restaurants must be in space 1. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  In the second possible arrangement, one of the restaurants must be in space 1, and the pharmacy must be in space 2. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  Since the question asks for the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and shoe store pair, the answer is either A: the pharmacy and a restaurant or B: the pharmacy and the toy store, depending on the possible arrangement.
Action: Answer("A or B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible scenarios:
  1) the optometrist is to the left of the shoe store
  2) the optometrist is to the right of the shoe store
  In either scenario, the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be next to the shoe store.
  The only option that satisfies this condition is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The optometrist is next to the shoe store.
  Therefore, the optometrist is not at either end of the row.
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the pharmacy is located at one end of the row, and the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the other restaurant cannot be next to the optometrist.
  The pharmacy is at one end of the row, and one of the restaurants is at the other end.
  Therefore, the restaurant that is not at the end of the row must be next to the other end.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the veterinarian is not next to the optometrist.
  The businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store are the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and the veterinarian.
  The answer is D: a restaurant and the toy store.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are two possible arrangements: 
  (1) optometrist is in space 2 and shoe store is in space 3; or
  (2) optometrist is in space 6 and shoe store is in space 5.
  
  Let's consider the first arrangement:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 1 or space 4.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 5 or space 7.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in space 4 and space 7.
  
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store in this arrangement are the pharmacy and the toy store.
  
  Now let's consider the second arrangement:
  - The pharmacy must be at one end of the row, so it must be in space 1 or space 7.
  - The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so the veterinarian must be in space 4 or space 7.
  - The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 2 or space 4.
  - The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants must be in space 3 and space 6.
  
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store in this arrangement are a restaurant and the toy store.
  
  So, the answer is either A: the pharmacy and a restaurant (for the first arrangement) or D: a restaurant and the toy store (for the second arrangement).
Action: Answer("A or D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, there are only two possible arrangements: 
  1. Optometrist, Shoe Store, _, _, _, _, Pharmacy/Restaurant
  2. _, Pharmacy/Restaurant, _, _, _, Shoe Store, Optometrist
  In arrangement 1, the pharmacy/restaurant must be at the end opposite to the restaurant. 
  In arrangement 2, the pharmacy/restaurant must be at the end opposite to the pharmacy.
  In both arrangements, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the arrangement must be 2, with the pharmacy at space 1, the optometrist at space 7, and the veterinarian at space 6. 
  The only choices that satisfy the condition are a restaurant and the toy store.
  The answer is D: a restaurant and the toy store.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought: 
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, the order of the businesses from left to right must be:
  [pharmacy], [optometrist or veterinarian], [shoe store], [toy store], [restaurant], [restaurant]
  The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other, so the businesses immediately on either side of the pharmacy must be the optometrist or the veterinarian and a restaurant.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the businesses immediately on either side of the two restaurants cannot be the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the businesses immediately on either side of the toy store must be the shoe store and a restaurant.
  Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of the optometrist and the shoe store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then there are two possible arrangements:
  1. Optometrist - Shoe Store - [ 5 businesses ] - Pharmacy or Restaurant
  2. Pharmacy or Restaurant - [ 5 businesses ] - Shoe Store - Optometrist
  
  In the first arrangement, the pharmacy or restaurant must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the arrangement must be:
  Optometrist - Shoe Store - [ 5 businesses ] - Pharmacy
  
  In the second arrangement, the pharmacy or restaurant must be at the other end of the row. Therefore, the arrangement must be:
  Pharmacy - [ 5 businesses ] - Shoe Store - Optometrist
  
  In both arrangements, the pharmacy is next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. Therefore, the veterinarian cannot be next to the toy store. Hence, the businesses immediately on either side of the Optometrist-Shoe Store pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the optometrist is next to the shoe store, then the optometrist cannot be at the end of the row where the pharmacy must be.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in either space 2, 3, 4, or 5.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the shoe store must be in space 1, which means the pharmacy must be in space 7. But the pharmacy cannot be next to the toy store. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 2.
  If the optometrist is in space 5, then the shoe store must be in space 6, which means the restaurant must be in space 7. But the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 5.
  If the optometrist is in space 3, then the shoe store must be in space 2 or 4. If the shoe store is in space 2, then the pharmacy must be in space 1, which is not possible. If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in space 5, which is not possible because the pharmacy must be at one end of the row. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 3.
  If the optometrist is in space 4, then the shoe store must be in space 3. Therefore, the businesses immediately on either side of this pair must be the pharmacy and a restaurant.
  The answer is A: the pharmacy and a restaurant.

Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: The first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday.
  B: The first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday.
  C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
  D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
  E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
- If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
- The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so it must be a different kind of cookie.
- The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.
- The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because there are only three batches of each kind of cookie made each week, so the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made earlier in the week.
- The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Wednesday.
- Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
- The answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.

Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that one batch of cookies is made on Friday.
  We know that exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Therefore, exactly one batch of each kind of cookie is made on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, we can determine the exact order of when each batch of cookies is made.
  We can then eliminate the choices that are not possible based on the given conditions.
  The only choice that could be true is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on the same day.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, and no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies can be made on Tuesday because it does not conflict with any of the other conditions.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the number of batches made on Monday through Thursday is 2.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Based on the above conditions, we can deduce the following:
  - One batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - One batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Wednesday.
  - One batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Tuesday.
  - One batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday. 
  The first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on that day.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday because only one batch is made on that day.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on that day.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on that day.
  Therefore, none of the choices could be true.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the other two batches must be made on Monday through Thursday.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.

  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday, which is not possible.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is not possible.
  If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, which is possible.
  Therefore, the answer is E: The second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:

Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If only one batch is made on Friday, then two batches of the same kind of cookie must have been made on the other days of the week.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must have been made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, so the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must have been made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday as well, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday as well, which means the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday.
  The third batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Friday, since the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on either Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday.
  The second batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday, since the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on that day.
  Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on either Monday or Wednesday.
  The only option that satisfies all the conditions is C: The third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we know that two batches are made on Monday, and one batch is made on each of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies can only be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies can only be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, which is impossible since the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday. Therefore, A is not true.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which is possible. Therefore, B could be true.
  If the third batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Friday, then the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday, which is impossible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, C is not true.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is impossible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday. This means that the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday, which is possible. Therefore, D could be true.
  If the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, then the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Wednesday. If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Wednesday, which is impossible since the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday. This means that the third batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Friday, which is possible. Therefore, E could be true.
  Therefore, B, D, and E could be true.
Action: Answer("BDE")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then we can use the process of elimination to determine which of the statements could be true.
  We know that at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  Since there are exactly three batches of each kind of cookie, we know that the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, if the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies would also be made on Wednesday, which means there would be more than one batch made on Friday.
  If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies would be made on Wednesday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies would be made on Thursday, which means there would be no batches made on Friday.
  If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of sugar cookies would be made on Wednesday, and the third batch of sugar cookies would be made on Friday. This means that there would be no batches of oatmeal or peanut butter cookies made on Friday.
  If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies would also be made on Wednesday, and the third batch of oatmeal cookies would be made on Thursday. This means that the third batch of peanut butter cookies would be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the only statement that could be true is D: The first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the number of batches made on Friday is exactly one, then the second batch of sugar cookies must have been made on Friday.
  The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday because at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on that day.
  The first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on the same day as the second batch of oatmeal cookies.

Context: Exactly five movies are showing at the repertory theater this evening: a horror film, a mystery, a romance, a sci-fi film, and a western. Each movie is shown exactly once, on one of the theater's three screens: screens 1, 2, and 3. Screens 1 and 2 show two movies each, one beginning at 7 P.M. and the other at 9 P.M.; screen 3 shows exactly one movie, at 8 P.M. The following conditions apply to this evening's schedule: The western begins at some time before the horror film does. The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3. The romance is not shown on screen 2. The horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first?

  Otherwise, the western is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M. or on screen 2 at 9 P.M., or on screen 3 at 8 P.M.
  
  A: the sci-fi film, the horror film - The horror film cannot be shown on screen 2 along with the sci-fi film, since the horror film and the mystery are shown on different screens. Therefore, this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
  
  B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - This is a possible list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
  
  C: the sci-fi film, the western - The western cannot be shown on screen 2 along with the sci-fi film, since the western begins before the horror film does. Therefore, this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
  
  D: the western, the horror film - If the western is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., it must be paired with the romance at 9 P.M. on screen 2. Therefore, this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.
  
  E: the western, the mystery - If the western is shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M., it must be paired with the romance at 9 P.M. on screen 2. Therefore, this cannot be an accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening.

  The sci-fi film is not shown on screen 3.
  Therefore, we can eliminate the answer choices that violate these conditions.
  If the horror film is shown on screen 1 at 7 P.M., then the mystery must be shown on screen 2 at 7 P.M. and the western must be shown on screen 2 at 9 P.M.
  The romance cannot be shown on screen 2, so it must be shown on screen 1 at 9 P.M.
  Therefore, the sci-fi film must be shown on screen 3 at 8 P.M.
  The only answer choice that violates these conditions is C: the sci-fi film, the western.

  If the western is shown on screen 2, then the sci-fi film cannot be shown on screen 2.
  If the sci-fi film is shown on screen 2, then the western cannot be shown on screen 2.
  Therefore, the only accurate list of the movies scheduled to be shown on screen 2 this evening, listing the 7 P.M. movie first, that does not violate the conditions is the one with the romance and the mystery.

B: the sci-fi film, the mystery - Possible, because the mystery can be shown on Screen 1.
C: the sci-fi film, the western - Possible, because the western can be shown on Screen 1 and the horror film can be shown on Screen 2.
D: the western, the horror film - Possible, because the western can be shown on Screen 2 before the horror film is shown on Screen 1.

Context: A shopping center has exactly seven spaces—space 1 through space 7—arranged in a straight row. Seven businesses—an optometrist, a pharmacy, two restaurants, a shoe store, a toy store, and a veterinarian—will be located in the shopping center, one in each space. The locations of the businesses are subject to the following constraints: The pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian. The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
Question: If the shoe store is in space 4, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.

  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  We can use these constraints to eliminate some of the answer choices.
  If the pharmacy is at one end of the row and a restaurant is at the other, then the optometrist must be next to the pharmacy and the veterinarian must be next to the restaurant.
  Therefore, the pharmacy must be next to the veterinarian, and we can eliminate choices A and D.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so we can eliminate choice E.
  This leaves us with choice C: A restaurant is next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:

  If the shoe store is in space 4, then there are two possible arrangements: 
  [1][2][3][4][5][6][7] or [7][6][5][4][3][2][1]
  If the pharmacy is at one end of the row, it can only be in space 1 or 7.
  If one of the restaurants is at the other end, it can only be in space 1 or 7.
  If the pharmacy is next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy is in space 1, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  If the pharmacy is next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the pharmacy is in space 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  If the two restaurants are separated by at least two businesses, then the restaurant at the other end of the row cannot be next to the pharmacy.
  If the toy store is not next to the veterinarian, then it must be in either space 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the only option that must be true is that a restaurant is next to the toy store.

  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the toy store must be in space 2.
  Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the toy store.
  The optometrist is not next to a restaurant since the two restaurants are separated by at least two other businesses.
  The pharmacy is not next to the veterinarian since the pharmacy is in space 4.

  Therefore, the answer is A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
If the shoe store is in space 4, the businesses located on spaces 3 and 5 must not be toy store or veterinarian according to the constraint that the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.

If the pharmacy is in space 2, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 1. But the pharmacy must be at one end of the row and one of the restaurants at the other. Therefore, the pharmacy cannot be in space 2. Therefore, the pharmacy must be in space 6.
If the pharmacy is in space 6, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 7. Therefore, the optometrist cannot be in space 1. Therefore, the veterinarian must be in space 1.
Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 7.
The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses. Therefore, the two restaurants must be in spaces 2 and 5.
Therefore, the shoe store is not next to the veterinarian or the toy store. Therefore, none of the choices A, B, C, and E can be true.
The only possible choice is D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in either space 1 or space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1, then the restaurant must be in space 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 7, then the restaurant must be in space 1.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the optometrist must be in space 2, 3, 5, or 6.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, so if the pharmacy is in space 1, then the veterinarian must be in space 2 or if the pharmacy is in space 7, then the veterinarian must be in space 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the veterinarian cannot be in space 5 or space 3.
  Therefore, the optometrist must be in space 2 or space 6.
  If the optometrist is in space 2, then the restaurant must be in space 7, which is not possible.
  If the optometrist is in space 6, then the restaurant must be in space 1.
  Therefore, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so a restaurant must be next to the toy store.
  The shoe store is in space 4, so it is not next to the toy store or the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the answer is A: The optometrist is next to a restaurant.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 or space 7.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses.
  Therefore, the optometrist cannot be next to a restaurant.
  The pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian, and the toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the only possible arrangement is: 
  [Pharmacy], [Optometrist or Veterinarian], [Restaurant], [Shoe Store], [Toy Store], [Restaurant], [Optometrist or Veterinarian].
  So, the pharmacy must be next to the optometrist or the veterinarian, which means the pharmacy must be in space 1.
  Therefore, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  So, the restaurant must be in space 3 or space 6.
  Since the two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, the restaurant cannot be in space 3.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 6.
  So, the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  Therefore, the shoe store is next to the toy store.
  The answer is D: The shoe store is next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, we can infer that the pharmacy must be in space 1 or 7.
  If the pharmacy is in space 1 or 7, then the optometrist or the veterinarian must be in space 2 or 6.
  The toy store cannot be next to the veterinarian, so the toy store must be in space 3 or 5.
  The two restaurants must be separated by at least two other businesses, so the two restaurants cannot be in spaces 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  Therefore, the restaurant must be in space 1 or 7.
  If the restaurant is in space 1, then the pharmacy must be in space 7 and the veterinarian must be in space 2.
  If the restaurant is in space 7, then the pharmacy must be in space 1 and the optometrist must be in space 6.
  In both cases, the shoe store is not next to the toy store, so D is false.
  A is also false because the optometrist cannot be next to a restaurant.
  B is true because the pharmacy must be next to either the optometrist or the veterinarian.
  C is false because the restaurant cannot be next to the toy store.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If the shoe store is in space 4, then there are two possible arrangements for the businesses: 
  1. [pharmacy], [optometrist/veterinarian], [restaurant], [shoe store], [toy store], [restaurant], [veterinarian/optometrist]
  2. [restaurant], [optometrist/veterinarian], [pharmacy], [shoe store], [toy store], [restaurant], [veterinarian/optometrist]
  In the first arrangement, the pharmacy is next to the optometrist or veterinarian.
  In the second arrangement, the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.
  Therefore, the statement "the pharmacy is next to the veterinarian" must be true.
  The answer is B: The pharmacy is next to the veterinarian.

Context: Three rugs will be woven out of colored thread. Six colors of thread are available—forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white, and yellow—exactly five of which will be used to weave the rugs. Each color that is used will be used in only one of the rugs. The rugs are either solid—woven in a single color—or multicolored. The rugs must be woven according to the following rules: In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.

Choices:
  A: forest and peach
  B: forest and yellow
  C: peach and turquoise
  D: peach and yellow
  E: turquoise and yellow
Response 0:
Thought:
  There are six colors of thread available.
  Exactly five of them will be used to weave three rugs.
  Each color is used in only one rug.
  There are two solid rugs and one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the multicolored rug must contain all the remaining three colors.
  If forest and peach are used in a solid rug, then the third color cannot be used with white because two other colors must be used with white.
  If forest and yellow are used in a solid rug, then the third color cannot be peach because peach must be used with olive.
  If peach and turquoise are used in a solid rug, then the third color cannot be forest because forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  If peach and yellow are used in a solid rug, then the third color cannot be turquoise because peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  If turquoise and yellow are used in a solid rug, then the third color cannot be peach because peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be peach and yellow.
  The answer is D: peach and yellow.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  From the rules, we know that if white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, white cannot be used in any solid rug because there are no other colors to pair it with.
  We need to find two colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug.
  From the rules, we know that forest and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in another solid rug.
  Answer choices A and B both include forest, so they are both eliminated.
  Answer choice C includes turquoise, so it is eliminated.
  Answer choice D includes peach, which is already used in a solid rug with olive, so it is eliminated.
  Answer choice E includes turquoise, which is already used in a solid rug with forest, so it is eliminated.
  Therefore, the answer is D: peach and yellow.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a rug, then two other colors are also used.
  If olive is used in a rug, then peach is also used.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then neither of them can have white or olive.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then one of them must be a single color rug, and the other must be a two-color rug.
  Therefore, the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, or peach and turquoise, or peach and yellow.
  The answer is A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the remaining rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used, so white must be used in a multicolored rug.
  Olive and peach are used together in a rug, so if peach is used in the multicolored rug, olive must also be used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug, so if forest is used in a solid rug, turquoise cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug, so if peach is used in a solid rug, turquoise cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug, so if peach is used in a solid rug, yellow cannot be used in the other solid rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and yellow.
  The answer is B: forest and yellow.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  There are six colors of thread available.
  Exactly five of the colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  The rugs are either solid or multicolored.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each rug will have only one color.
  Therefore, the two solid rugs cannot share any colors.
  From the rules, forest and peach cannot be used together in a rug.
  From the rules, forest and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  From the rules, peach and turquoise cannot be used together in a rug.
  From the rules, peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be forest and peach, forest and yellow, peach and turquoise, or peach and yellow.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  There are six colors available.
  Exactly five colors will be used to weave the rugs.
  Each color will be used in only one of the rugs.
  There are two solid rugs.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug must use three colors.
  Therefore, we can eliminate any answer choices that include only one of the colors that cannot be used together in a rug.
  The colors that cannot be used together in a rug are forest and turquoise, peach and turquoise, and peach and yellow.
  Answer choices C, D, and E include only one of these pairs of colors.
  Therefore, the colors of the two solid rugs cannot be the colors in answer choices C, D, or E.
  The only answer choice that is left is A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. Therefore, white can only be used in a multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used. Therefore, olive and peach can only be used together in a multicolored rug.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in a solid rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in a solid rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug. Therefore, if one of them is used in a solid rug, the other cannot be used in a solid rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then they must use a total of four colors.
  From the above deductions, the only two colors that cannot be used together in a solid rug are forest and peach.
  Therefore, the answer is A: forest and peach.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then the third rug must be multicolored.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each solid rug must use only one color from the available colors.
  Therefore, if there are exactly two solid rugs, then the colors of those two rugs CANNOT be forest and peach, or forest and yellow, because forest is not used alone, it must be used with another color, and turquoise is not used with forest in the same rug. Also, peach and yellow cannot be used together in a rug, so they cannot be the colors of the two solid rugs.
  The answer is C: peach and turquoise.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then there must be one multicolored rug.
  In any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used.
  In any rug in which olive is used, peach is also used.
  Forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and turquoise are not used together in a rug.
  Peach and yellow are not used together in a rug.
  If there are exactly two solid rugs, then each of the five colors must be used in exactly one of the three rugs.
  If forest or peach is used in a solid rug, then the other color must be used in the multicolored rug.
  If olive is used in a solid rug, then peach must be used in the multicolored rug.
  If white is used in a solid rug, then two other colors must be used. Therefore, white cannot be used in a multicolored rug.
  If turquoise is used in a solid rug, then neither forest nor peach can be used in the same rug. Therefore, forest and peach cannot both be used in a solid rug.
  If peach is used in a solid rug, then neither turquoise nor yellow can be used in the same rug. Therefore, turquoise and yellow cannot both be used in a solid rug.
  The colors of the two solid rugs CANNOT be forest and peach, or peach and turquoise, or peach and yellow.
  Therefore, the answer is D: peach and yellow.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can start by listing all the possible combinations of five colors out of the six available colors: 
  - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white
  - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, yellow
  - forest, olive, peach, white, yellow
  - forest, olive, turquoise, white, yellow
  - forest, peach, turquoise, white, yellow
  - olive, peach, turquoise, white, yellow
  - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, white
  - forest, olive, peach, turquoise, yellow
  - forest, olive, white, turquoise, yellow
  - forest, peach, white, turquoise, yellow
  - olive, peach, white, turquoise, yellow
  - forest, olive, peach, white, turquoise
  - forest, olive, peach, yellow, turquoise
  - forest, olive, white, yellow, turquoise
  - forest, peach, white, yellow, turquoise
  - olive, peach, white, yellow, turquoise
  
  We know that there are exactly two solid rugs, which means that three colors are used in each solid rug. 
  We also know that in any rug in which white is used, two other colors are also used. This means that white cannot be used in a solid rug since it would require at least four colors to be used. Hence, the two solid rugs must be made up of only non-white colors.
  From the list of possible combinations above, we can eliminate all the combinations that include white. 
  We also know that forest and turquoise are not used together in a rug. This eliminates the first two combinations in the list above.
  This leaves us with the following combinations for the two solid rugs:
  - olive, peach, yellow
  - peach, turquoise, yellow
  - olive, turquoise, white
  - peach, white, turquoise
  - olive, white, yellow
  - peach, white, yellow
  We need to find the two colors that are NOT used in these combinations.
  Answer: E: turquoise and yellow.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 87 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Seven workers—Quinn, Ruiz, Smith, Taylor, Verma, Wells, and Xue—are being considered for a special project. Exactly three of the workers will be selected to be project members, and exactly one of these project members will be the project leader. The selection is subject to the following constraints: Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
Question: Verma could be the project leader if which one of the following is true?
Choices:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We are given that exactly one of the selected members will be the project leader.
  We are also given that Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Therefore, if either Quinn or Ruiz is selected, they must be the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be selected.
  We are given that exactly three workers will be selected for the project.
  Therefore, we can eliminate the options where three of the workers mentioned are not selected.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member.
  Similarly, if Taylor is not selected, Smith cannot be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Wells is selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Let's examine the options one by one:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. If Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. If Taylor is not selected, Smith cannot be a project member. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. This option is possible. If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Wells must be selected. In this case, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members, so Verma can be the project leader.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. If Smith is not selected, Taylor cannot be a project member. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. If Wells is not selected, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members. Therefore, this option is not possible.
  The only possible option is C.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We need to determine if Verma could be the project leader under certain conditions.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Smith must be a project member and Taylor must also be.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Quinn or Ruiz cannot be project members.
  From the given answer choices, we need to find a condition where Verma can be the project leader given the above constraints.
  Answer choice A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. This condition does not allow Smith to be a project member, which means Taylor cannot be a project member as well. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader under this condition.
  Answer choice B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. This condition allows Smith to be a project member without Taylor being a project member. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader under this condition.
  Answer choice C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. This condition does not allow Smith to be a project member, which means Taylor cannot be a project member as well. Therefore, Verma cannot be the project leader under this condition.
  Answer choice D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. This condition allows Taylor to be a project member without Smith being a project member. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader under this condition.
  Answer choice E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. This condition allows Smith to be a project member without Taylor being a project member and Wells not being a project member. Therefore, Verma can be the project leader under this condition.
  Therefore, answer choices B, D, and E could allow Verma to be the project leader.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be in the project.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells is not selected.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith is not selected.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  The remaining workers are Taylor and Xue.
  Therefore, Verma could be the project leader if Taylor and Xue are selected.
  This is only true if neither Smith nor Wells is selected.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Verma is the project leader, then exactly two of the remaining workers will be project members.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  If neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma can be the project leader.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Verma is selected as a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be selected.
  If Verma is the project leader, then either Quinn or Ruiz must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Smith and Taylor are project members, then neither Ruiz nor Wells can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Quinn must be the third project member.
  The only option that meets this condition is A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  We want to determine if Verma could be the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, then Wells must be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, and Smith is a project member, then Taylor must also be a project member.
  This means that Wells, Verma, and Taylor would be the project members.
  Therefore, if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected, then Verma could be the project leader.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  If Wells is a project member, then neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  If Verma is the project leader, then the other two members must be chosen from Smith, Taylor, and Xue.
  Therefore, if Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be, and Xue cannot be.
  If Verma is the project leader, then neither Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members, and neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members if Wells is a project member.
  This means that Smith and Taylor must be selected, and the third member must be either Wells or Xue.
  Therefore, the only option where Verma could be the project leader is if neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
  The answer is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  The problem states that exactly one of the three project members will be the project leader.
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be project members.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, the project members must be selected from the remaining four workers: Quinn, Smith, Taylor, and Wells.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, the project members must be either Smith and Taylor or Wells and Quinn.
  Since Verma can only be the project leader if leading the project, the project members must be Smith and Taylor. So, if Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be selected as project members.
  Therefore, the answer is C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  If Verma is the project leader, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be a project member.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be project members.
  If Quinn or Ruiz is a project member, they must be the project leader.
  Therefore, if Verma is the project leader, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be project members.
  If Verma is the project leader, Smith and Taylor must be project members and neither Wells nor Ruiz nor Quinn can be project members.
  Therefore, the only possibility is if Xue is one of the project members.
  Therefore, the answer is D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought: 
  Verma could be the project leader if she is selected as a project member and then selected to be the project leader.
  If Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be. Therefore, if Verma is selected, Wells cannot be a project member.
  If Smith is a project member, Taylor must also be. Therefore, if Verma is selected, Smith must also be a project member.
  Quinn or Ruiz can be a project member only if leading the project. Therefore, if Verma is not selected as the project leader, neither Quinn nor Ruiz can be a project member.
  We can now test each choice to see if it satisfies the constraints:
  A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected. - This constraint does not affect Verma's selection.
  B: Neither Ruiz nor Taylor is selected. - This constraint does not affect Verma's selection.
  C: Neither Smith nor Taylor is selected. - This constraint does not satisfy the constraint that if Verma is selected, Smith must also be a project member.
  D: Neither Smith nor Xue is selected. - This constraint does not affect Verma's selection.
  E: Neither Taylor nor Wells is selected. - This constraint does not satisfy the constraint that if Wells is a project member, neither Ruiz nor Verma can be.
  Therefore, the only choice that satisfies all the constraints is A: Neither Quinn nor Smith is selected.

Response 0:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K is shown and before M is shown.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, L cannot be shown in the morning or evening.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so M cannot be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the morning or afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K and L cannot be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so K and L must be shown in the afternoon.
  M is shown at some time after L is shown, so M cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the evening.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so the sixth and seventh houses cannot be J.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so the first and second houses cannot be K.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown are shown in the afternoon, so L must be one of them.
  Therefore, K must be shown in the morning, and M must be shown in the evening.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 3:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening. Therefore, J is the 6th or 7th house to be shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, K is the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th house to be shown.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L is the 4th or 5th house to be shown.
  Therefore, M is the 5th, 6th, or 7th house to be shown.
  The afternoon houses are the 3rd, 4th, and 5th houses to be shown.
  Therefore, K, L, and M are shown in the afternoon.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:

  J is shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, we can deduce that K is shown in the afternoon, and M is shown in the evening.
  Since L must be shown after K and before M, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, the answer is B: L is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so J is the 6th or 7th house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K is the 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th or 7th house.
  L must be shown after K and before M, so L is the 4th or 5th house.
  Thus, K is either the 3rd, 6th or 7th house.
  If K is the 3rd house, then L must be the 4th house, and M must be the 5th house.
  If K is the 6th house, then L must be the 4th or 5th house, and M must be the 3rd, 4th or 5th house.
  If K is the 7th house, then L must be the 4th or 5th house, and M must be the 3rd, 4th or 5th house.
  Therefore, L is shown in the afternoon, and M is shown in the afternoon.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  From the given rules, we can conclude that K must be shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown, so L cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time before M is shown, so M cannot be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, the only possible time for M to be shown is in the afternoon.
  From the given rules, we cannot conclude anything about the time when L is shown.
  Therefore, the answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 7:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.

  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  From the rules, we know that J is shown in the evening, so J cannot be the first or second house shown.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the evening.
  The answer is E: M is shown in the afternoon.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so the sixth and seventh houses cannot be J.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning, so K cannot be the first or second house.
  Therefore, K must be the third, fourth, or fifth house shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon after K is shown or in the evening before M is shown.
  Therefore, M must be shown in the afternoon or evening after L is shown.
  Therefore, A, B, and D are not true.
  C and E are possible, but we cannot determine which one is true.
Action: Answer("None of the above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J is shown in the evening, so J must be the sixth or seventh house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh house.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L must be the fourth or fifth house and M must be the sixth or seventh house.
  Therefore, K cannot be the third house and must be either the sixth or seventh house.
  If K is the sixth house, then L must be the fourth house and M must be the seventh house, which satisfies all the rules.
  If K is the seventh house, then L must be the fourth or fifth house and M must be the sixth house, which violates the rule that L must be shown at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K is the sixth house, L is the fourth house, and M is the seventh house. 
  L is shown in the afternoon and M is shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the answer is C: L is shown in the evening.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 89 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A government needs to assign new ambassadors to Venezuela, Yemen, and Zambia. The candidates for these ambassadorships are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, Novetzke, and Ong. One ambassador will be assigned to each country, and no ambassador will be assigned to more than one country. The assignment of the ambassadors must meet the following constraints: Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships. If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne. If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen. If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
Question: If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  C: Ong is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  D: Jaramillo is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
  E: Ong is not assigned to an ambassadorship.
Response 0:
Thought:
  We are given that if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong is not assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  We are also given that if Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to one country, then Kayne is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  We are not given any direct information about Landon or Novetzke.
  Therefore, we need to use the given information to eliminate the impossible scenarios and determine the possible scenarios.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the other two ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is that Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  The answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the three ambassadorships.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must also be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, then it must be to Zambia.
  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  The answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to an ambassadorship, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke is not assigned to Yemen, which means that Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne is also assigned to an ambassadorship, which means that Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")

  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon and Ong can only be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively.
  The only possible answer is B: Landon is assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of the ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must also be assigned as ambassador to one of the other countries.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia, so it is not possible for Landon to be assigned as ambassador to Yemen or Venezuela.

  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon cannot be assigned as ambassador to Zambia. 
  So, the answer is not B.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  So, the answer is A.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong cannot be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia, and not Yemen or Venezuela.
  Therefore, if Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, Landon and Jaramillo could still be assigned to Venezuela and Zambia, but we do not have enough information to determine which one of them will be assigned to which country.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Novetzke cannot be assigned to any ambassadorship.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 90 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert is given by a six-member band—guitarist, keyboard player, percussionist, saxophonist, trumpeter, violinist. During the concert, each member performs exactly one solo. The following restrictions apply: The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo. The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does. The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
Question: Which one of the following CANNOT perform the third
Choices:
  A: guitarist
  B: keyboard player
  C: saxophonist
  D: trumpeter
  E: violinist
Response 0:
Thought: 
  To determine who cannot perform the third solo, let's first consider who can perform the third solo given the restrictions.
  From the restrictions, we know that the guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, which means he must perform either the first, second, or third solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player, so he must perform either the first or second solo.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist, so he must perform the second or third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, but not both, so he must perform either the second, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  The trumpeter must perform either the first, second, or fifth solo.
  The violinist must perform either the first, third, fourth, or fifth solo.
  Therefore, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the saxophonist because he must perform either the second, fourth, or fifth solo.
  The answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist and before the guitarist.
  Therefore, the order of solo performances is: percussionist, trumpet/saxophonist, violinist, keyboard player, guitarist.
  Therefore, the person who performs the third solo is the violinist.
  Therefore, everyone can perform the third solo except for the violinist.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 2:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  Let's assume that the third solo is performed by the saxophonist.
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist or the trumpeter performs the first solo.
  If the percussionist performs the first solo, then the keyboard player performs the second solo.
  If the keyboard player performs the second solo, then the violinist performs the third solo.
  However, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo since the saxophonist is already assigned to perform a solo after the percussionist or the trumpeter.
  Therefore, the saxophonist CANNOT perform the third solo.
  The answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to determine who must perform the third solo.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. This means that one of the percussionist or the trumpeter must perform before the saxophonist performs, and the other one must perform after the saxophonist performs. 
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does. This means that the violinist must perform before the keyboard player performs, and the guitarist must perform after the keyboard player performs.
  Therefore, the order of performances must be: percussionist or trumpeter, violinist, keyboard player, saxophonist, guitarist, and violinist cannot perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the saxophonist performs the third solo, then the percussionist must have performed the first or second solo. This would mean that the keyboard player would perform a solo after the violinist but before the guitarist, which is not possible. Therefore, the saxophonist cannot perform the third solo.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Since there are six members in the band, each of them can perform the solo in six different positions: 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th.
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  To determine who cannot perform the third solo, we need to examine the possible positions of the third solo for each member, given the restrictions.
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo, so the possible positions for the guitarist's solo are 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th.
  The percussionist performs a solo before the keyboard player does, so the possible positions for the percussionist's solo are 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
  The keyboard player performs a solo after the violinist does and before the guitarist does, so the possible positions for the keyboard player's solo are 2nd or 3rd.
  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both. Therefore, the saxophonist's solo can be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
  The violinist's solo can be in any of the six positions.
  Given the above information, the only member who cannot perform the third solo is the saxophonist, whose solo can be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th position.
  Therefore, the answer is C: saxophonist.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  The guitarist does not perform the fourth solo.
  The percussionist performs a solo at some time before the keyboard player does.
  The keyboard player performs a solo at some time after the violinist does and at some time before the guitarist does.
  The saxophonist performs a solo at some time after either the percussionist does or the trumpeter does, but not both.
  If the saxophonist performs a solo after the percussionist does, then the percussionist cannot perform the third solo.
  If the saxophonist performs a solo after the trumpeter does, then the trumpeter cannot perform the third solo.
  The guitarist cannot perform the fourth solo.
  Therefore, the only remaining options for the third solo are the keyboard player and the violinist.
  None of the given restrictions eliminate the possibility of the keyboard player or the violinist performing the third solo.
  Therefore, none of the above restrictions indicate that any of the given band members cannot perform the third solo.
  The answer is None of the Above.
Action: Answer("None of the Above")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  We are looking for the musician who cannot perform the third solo.

  The saxophonist performs a solo after either the percussionist or the trumpeter, so they could perform the second, third, fourth, or sixth solo.
  The violinist could perform the first, second, or fifth solo.
  Therefore, the only musician left is the trumpeter, who cannot perform the third solo.
  The answer is D: trumpeter.

  There are six members in the band and each of them performs exactly one solo.
  Therefore, the saxophonist must perform the solo before the guitarist does.
  If the saxophonist performs before the guitarist, then the guitarist cannot perform the third solo.
  Therefore, the answer is A: guitarist.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 91 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A chorus director is planning to audition exactly six singers: Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, and Zinn. Kammer's audition and Lugo's audition will be recorded; the other four will not be. The six auditions are to take place one after the other on a single day, in accordance with the following conditions: The fourth audition cannot be recorded. The fifth audition must be recorded. Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
Question: Which one of the following could be the sixth audition?
Choices:
  A: Kammer's audition
  B: Lugo's audition
  C: Trillo's audition
  D: Waite's audition
  E: Zinn's audition
Response 0:
Thought:
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded and the fourth audition cannot be recorded.
  We also know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  If Kammer's audition is the first one, then Trillo's audition must be the second one.
  If Zinn's audition is the first one, then Yoshida's audition must be the last one.
  Therefore, the possible orders of the auditions are:
  1. Kammer, Trillo, Waite, Zinn, Yoshida, Lugo
  2. Zinn, Kammer, Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, Lugo
  If we compare the two possible orders, we can see that Trillo's audition is always before Lugo's audition.
  Therefore, Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Answer: Answer("B") Lugo's audition.
Response 1:
Thought: 
  We know that the fifth audition must be recorded. Therefore, the fifth audition is either Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition.
  We also know that the fourth audition cannot be recorded. Therefore, the fourth audition is either Trillo's audition or Waite's audition.
  We know that Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions. Therefore, Waite's audition cannot be the fifth audition (which is recorded). Thus, Waite's audition must be the fourth audition.
  We know that Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition. Therefore, Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition, because Kammer's audition must happen before it.
  We know that Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition. Therefore, Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition, because Zinn's audition must happen before it.
  Therefore, the only possible option for the sixth audition is Lugo's audition.
  The answer is B: Lugo's audition.

  The fifth audition must be recorded, so either Kammer or Lugo must be the fifth audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so either Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, or Zinn must be the fourth audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite cannot be the fifth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer cannot be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn cannot be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the sixth audition could be either Lugo, Trillo, or Waite.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so it can only be Kammer's audition or Lugo's audition.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so it cannot be Trillo's audition.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so it cannot be the sixth audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Trillo's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Yoshida's audition cannot be the sixth audition.
  Therefore, the only possible option for the sixth audition is Zinn's audition.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 4:
Thought: 
  According to the conditions, we can infer the following order of auditions: Waite, Kammer, Lugo, Trillo, (unrecorded audition), Yoshida, Zinn.
  The sixth audition must take place after the fifth audition, which is Yoshida's audition.
  Therefore, the sixth audition must be either Kammer's audition or Zinn's audition.
Action: Answer("A or E")
Response 5:
Thought:
  The fifth audition must be recorded, so the fifth audition must be either Kammer or Lugo.
  The fourth audition cannot be recorded, so the fourth audition must be either Trillo, Waite, Yoshida, or Zinn.
  Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions, so Waite's audition must be either the second or third audition.
  Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition, so Kammer's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition, so Zinn's audition must be either the first or second audition.
  Therefore, the possible orders of the auditions are:
  1. Zinn, Kammer, Waite, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  2. Kammer, Zinn, Waite, Trillo, Lugo, Yoshida
  The sixth audition in the first order is Lugo, and in the second order is Yoshida.
  Therefore, the answer is either B: Lugo's audition or E: Yoshida's audition.
Action: Answer("B or E")

  - Waite's audition must take place earlier than the two recorded auditions.
  - Kammer's audition must take place earlier than Trillo's audition.
  - Zinn's audition must take place earlier than Yoshida's audition.
  Since we know that the fifth audition must be recorded, and the fourth cannot, the fifth audition must be Lugo's. Therefore, Waite's audition must be third. Kammer's audition must be first, and Trillo's audition must be after Kammer's. Also, Zinn's audition must be before Yoshida's. 
  Therefore, the only option that could be the sixth audition is C: Trillo's audition.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 92 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: In the Lifestyle, Metro, and Sports sections of tomorrow's newspaper, a total of six different photographs are to appear, exactly two photographs per section. Each of the available photographs was taken by one of three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue. Selection of the photographs is constrained by the following conditions: For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographers photographs must appear. At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section. The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
Question: If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  C: Both photographs in the Metro section are by Gagnon.
  D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue.
Response 0:
Thought: 
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the third photographer Fuentes must have both photographs in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, which is two.
  Therefore, there are no photographs by Hue in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, both photographs in the Sports section are by Fuentes.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The answer is B: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Gagnon or Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has a photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Based on these conditions, we can conclude that:
    - Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Sports section.
    - Hue must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
    - Gagnon cannot have any photograph in the Sports section.
    - Therefore, the photograph in the Sports section cannot be by Hue.
    - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
    - Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
    - Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 2:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes or Gagnon.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  So, one photo in Lifestyle is by Gagnon, one by Hue, and one by Fuentes.
  Thus, the two photos in Metro must be by Fuentes and Gagnon, and the two photos in Sports must be by Hue and Fuentes.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes and exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  The answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, so either Hue or Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section, so if Hue has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have a photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes, and either Hue or Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section, but it cannot be Gagnon. 
  The only option that satisfies these conditions is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  From the given conditions, we know that at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If one of the photographs in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the other photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, Fuentes must have at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  From the given conditions, we know that none of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Hue must have the same number of photographs in the Sports section as Fuentes.
  If Hue has one photograph in the Sports section, then Fuentes must have one photograph in the Sports section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 5:
Thought:
  From the given conditions:
  - Each section will have exactly two photographs.
  - There are three photographers: Fuentes, Gagnon, and Hue.
  - For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  - At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  - The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  - None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Let's analyze the options:
  - Option A: It is not necessarily true. There can be zero or two photographs in the Metro section by Fuentes.
  - Option B: It is not necessarily true. There can be zero or two photographs in the Metro section by Gagnon.
  - Option C: It is not possible. We already know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue. Therefore, there cannot be two photographs in the Metro section by Gagnon.
  - Option D: It is not necessarily true. There can be zero or two photographs in the Sports section by Hue.
  - Option E: It must be true. We know that the number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. Also, we know that one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Hue. Therefore, one photograph in the Sports section must be by Hue.
  The correct answer is E: Both photographs in the Sports section are by Hue. 
Action: Answer("E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  Therefore, the photograph in the Lifestyle section by Gagnon or Hue must be paired with a photograph by Fuentes in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, if one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then one photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes and one photograph in the Sports section must be by Fuentes.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 7:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by either Fuentes, Gagnon, or Hue.
  At least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section.
  If Gagnon has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, then Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section as well.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  
Analysis:
  From the given conditions, we know that Gagnon has a photograph in the Lifestyle section, which means that Gagnon must have a photograph in the Metro section as well. Therefore, option B and C are possible.
  However, we do not know anything about Fuentes' photographs in the Sports section or Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section, so options A, D, and E cannot be determined.
  
Answer: Answer("B")
Response 8:
Thought:
  One photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue.
  Each section has exactly two photographs.
  For each photographer, at least one but no more than three of that photographer's photographs must appear.
  Therefore, the third photograph for Gagnon and Hue must appear in the Metro section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the third photograph for Fuentes must appear in the Sports section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section.
  Therefore, Gagnon's third photograph must appear in the Metro section.
  Therefore, exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Gagnon.
  The other photograph in the Metro section must be by Fuentes.
  Therefore, Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
  The answer is D: Exactly one photograph in the Sports section is by Hue.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  If one photograph in the Lifestyle section is by Gagnon and one is by Hue, then the remaining photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by Fuentes.
  Since at least one photograph in the Lifestyle section must be by a photographer who has at least one photograph in the Metro section, and we already have Gagnon and Hue in the Lifestyle section, then Fuentes must have a photograph in the Metro section.
  None of Gagnon's photographs can be in the Sports section, so Gagnon cannot have a photograph in the Sports section.
  The number of Hue's photographs in the Lifestyle section must be the same as the number of Fuentes photographs in the Sports section. If Fuentes has one photograph in the Metro section and one in the Sports section, then Hue must also have one photograph in the Lifestyle section and one in the Sports section.
  Therefore, the only statement that must be true is that exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.
  The answer is A: Exactly one photograph in the Metro section is by Fuentes.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 93 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A bakery makes exactly three kinds of cookie—oatmeal, peanut butter, and sugar. Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week (Monday through Friday) and each batch is made, from start to finish, on a single day. The following conditions apply: No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday. The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
Question: If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday.
  B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
  D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
  E: Fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then all 3 batches of cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, or Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday and the first batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  If all 3 batches of cookies are made on Thursday, then the third batch of sugar cookies will be made on the same day as the first batch of oatmeal cookies, which violates the condition that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, all 3 batches of cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Friday.
  If all 3 batches of cookies are made on Monday, then there will be at least two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day, which violates the condition.
  If all 3 batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then there will be at least two batches of the same kind of cookie made on the same day, which violates the condition.
  Therefore, all 3 batches of cookies must be made on Friday.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 1:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then the batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.
  Since no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Monday or Tuesday.
  Since at least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, if the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Monday.
  Therefore, the answer is C: At least two batches of cookies are made on Monday.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are only three possible configurations for the batches of cookies made on each day of the week.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batches of cookies are made on Wednesday, then there are two possible configurations for the batches of cookies made on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.
  If only one batch of cookies is made on Monday, then there must be at least two batches of cookies made on Tuesday or Friday.
  If two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then there is only one batch of cookies left to be made on Tuesday or Friday.
  Therefore, if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then either exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday or exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  The answer is either A or B.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Let's start by making a table to keep track of the batches of cookies made each day.
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    |         |               |       |
| Tuesday   |         |               |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         |               |       |
| Friday    |         |               |       |

  From the given conditions, we know that:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  
  Let's use some logic to fill in the table:
  - Since no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day, we can fill in the first batch of each kind of cookie on different days.
  - We know that the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so we can fill those in together.
  - We know that the second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so we can fill that in as well.
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | 1       | 1             |       |
| Tuesday   | 2       | 2             |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         |               | 2     |
| Friday    | 3       | 3             | 1     |

  Now we need to figure out what happens if no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  - If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Friday, then we would need to make at least one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition.
  - Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on either Monday, Tuesday, or Thursday.
  - If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then we would need to make at least one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition.
  - If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then we would need to make at least one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies on Wednesday, which contradicts the given condition.
  - Therefore, the third batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  - If the third batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, then we can fill in the rest of the table:
  
| Day       | Oatmeal | Peanut Butter | Sugar |
|-----------|---------|---------------|-------|
| Monday    | 1       | 1             |       |
| Tuesday   | 2       | 2             |       |
| Wednesday |         |               |       |
| Thursday  |         |               | 3     |
| Friday    | 3       | 3             | 1     |

  Now we can see that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday. Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then one batch of each kind of cookie must be made on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. Therefore, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Tuesday because the second batch of oatmeal cookies is already made on that day. Thus, the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Monday as well.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Monday or Tuesday because the first batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are already made on those days. The first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday because no batch of cookies is made on that day. Thus, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, on Friday, one batch of oatmeal, one batch of peanut butter, and one batch of sugar cookies must be made.
  The answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then there are four days left (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday) to make nine batches of cookies (three batches of each kind).
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so they must be made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the third batch of sugar cookies is made on either Monday or Tuesday.
  Therefore, on Monday, either one or two batches of oatmeal or sugar cookies are made, and at least one batch of any of the three kinds of cookies is made.
  If two batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Monday, then one batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday, and the other batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday. Then, all three batches of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday and all three kinds of cookies are made on Friday. This means exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday and Friday. So, A and B are not true.
  If one batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then two batches of oatmeal cookies are made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday. Then, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Friday along with all three batches of sugar cookies. This means exactly two batches of cookies are made on Monday and Thursday. So, D is not true.
  Therefore, C is true because on Monday, at least one batch of any of the three kinds of cookies is made.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, then either two batches of cookies are made on Monday, or two batches of cookies are made on Thursday. 
  If two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of sugar cookies are made on Monday. Therefore, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Tuesday, and the remaining two batches of oatmeal and sugar cookies are made on Thursday and Friday. In this case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so A is not necessarily true.
  If two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, then one batch of oatmeal cookies and one batch of peanut butter cookies are made on Thursday. Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Friday, and the remaining two batches of oatmeal and peanut butter cookies are made on Monday and Tuesday. In this case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, so B is true.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought:
  No batch of cookies is made on Wednesday.
  Each kind of cookie is made exactly three times a week.
  Therefore, there must be one day on which no batch of cookies is made.
  From the given conditions, we know that no two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  Therefore, it is not possible for all three batches of the same kind of cookie to be made on Tuesday or Friday.
  If three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, then one of those batches must be oatmeal cookies.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, it is not possible for exactly three batches of cookies to be made on Tuesday.
  Similarly, if three batches of cookies are made on Friday, then one of those batches must be sugar cookies.
  Therefore, the second batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Thursday.
  Therefore, it is not possible for exactly three batches of cookies to be made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer must be either C or D.
  If at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, then one of those batches must be oatmeal cookies.
  Therefore, the second batch of oatmeal cookies cannot be made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  Therefore, at least two batches of cookies are not made on Monday.
  Therefore, the answer cannot be C.
  Therefore, the answer must be D: At least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 8:
Thought:
  We can start by making a chart of the batches of cookies that are made on each day.
  Based on the given conditions, we know that:
  - At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday, so Monday has at least one batch of cookies.
  - No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day. So, Monday has at most three different kinds of cookies.
  - The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies. So, the first batch of peanut butter cookies cannot be made on Wednesday, as there are no batches of cookies made on Wednesday.
  - The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday. Therefore, the first batch of sugar cookies cannot be made on Wednesday.
  We can now deduce the following:
  - If the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is also made on Monday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday. Then, the second batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of sugar cookies on Friday. In this case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday, so the answer is B.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. Then, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies on Friday. In this case, exactly three batches of cookies are made on Tuesday, so the answer is A.
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Tuesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Wednesday. Then, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of sugar cookies on Friday. In this case, at least two batches of cookies are made on Monday, so the answer is C.
  - If the first batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday, and the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Monday. Then, the second batch of oatmeal cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of sugar cookies on Friday. In this case, at least two batches of cookies are made on Thursday, so the answer is D.
  - If the first batch of sugar cookies is made on Tuesday, then the second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on Monday, and the first batch of peanut butter cookies is made on Wednesday. Then, the second batch of sugar cookies must be made on Thursday and the second batch of peanut butter cookies on Friday. In this case, fewer batches of cookies are made on Monday than on Tuesday, so the answer is E.
  Therefore, either B, A, C, D, or E could be true, depending on which batches of cookies are made on which days. 
Action: Answer("B")
Response 9:
Thought:
  We can use the given conditions to create a schedule for the week.
  No two batches of the same kind of cookie are made on the same day.
  At least one batch of cookies is made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday.
  If no batch of cookies is made on Wednesday, the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Wednesday.
  We can use the given conditions to fill in the rest of the schedule.
  Exactly three batches of each kind of cookie are made each week.
  Exactly three batches of oatmeal cookies are made each week, so the first batch must be made on Monday.
  The second batch of oatmeal cookies is made on the same day as the first batch of peanut butter cookies, so the first batch of peanut butter cookies must be made on Monday.
  The second batch of sugar cookies is made on Thursday, so the first batch of sugar cookies must be made on Tuesday.
  After filling in the schedule, we can see that exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Exactly three batches of cookies are made on Friday.

  D: Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  E: Neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team and there are only two teams.
  The green team must have three members because it has a facilitator, Lateefah.
  Olga is a facilitator, so she must be on the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana must be assigned to the red team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Mei's assignment is not specified.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei may or may not be both facilitators.

Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga.
  There are two possible team configurations: green team (facilitators: Lateefah and Olga) and red team (facilitator: Mei).
  Juana must be assigned to the red team since she cannot be assigned to the same team as Olga.
  Mei is the only member left to be assigned to the red team, so Mei must be the facilitator of the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is assigned as a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana is assigned to the green team.
  There are two possible assignments for the teams: (1) Green team: Lateefah, Olga, Mei; Red team: Juana, Kelly or (2) Green team: Lateefah, Juana; Red team: Kelly, Olga, Mei.
  However, Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, the only possible assignment is (2).
  Mei is not a facilitator.

  Therefore, Juana and Mei must be assigned to the same team as they are the only two people left.
  If Mei is a facilitator then Juana is not a facilitator and vice versa.
  If Juana is assigned to the red team then Mei is assigned to the green team.
  If Juana is assigned to the green team then Mei is assigned to the red team.
  Therefore, Juana and Mei are not both facilitators.
  The only option that must be true is C: Olga is assigned to the green team.
Action: Answer("C")

Thought:
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team.
  Olga is a facilitator.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  There are only two teams, one with two members and the other with three members.
  Therefore, Juana, Kelly, Mei must be on the same team as Olga and Lateefah must be on the other team.
  Since Lateefah is on the green team and there are only two teams, Olga must be on the red team.
  Therefore, Juana, Kelly, Mei are on the green team.
  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is, so Juana must be on the green team and Olga must be on the red team.
  Therefore, neither Juana nor Kelly is a facilitator.
  Lateefah is assigned to the green team, so Lateefah is not a facilitator.
  Juana and Mei are both on the green team, so they are not both facilitators.

  Juana is assigned to a different team than Olga is.
  Therefore, Juana is a member of the green team.
  Kelly is not a facilitator.
  Therefore, Mei is the facilitator of the green team.
  Mei is a member of the red team and is a facilitator.
  Therefore, Mei is the only facilitator of the red team.

  B could be true if K is shown in the morning and L is shown in the afternoon.
  C could be true if P is shown in the evening.
  D is not possible because only one house can be shown in the evening and M is the last house to be shown in the afternoon.
  E is not possible because N and P cannot be shown in the afternoon because the afternoon is reserved for three houses.
  Therefore, the answer is either A, B, or C.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Therefore, J and K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, K must be shown before L and M.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening, so P cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  The fifth house to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so P cannot be shown before the afternoon.
  N and O must be shown after M.
  Therefore, N and P cannot both be shown after K because they have to be shown after M.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible because J must be shown in the evening.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible because P can be shown in the afternoon or evening, and J must be shown in the evening.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is possible because N and O must be shown after M.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is not possible because N and P have to be shown after M, and K has to be shown before L and M.
  
Answer: Answer("C")
Response 2:
Thought:
  We are given a set of rules that dictate the order in which the houses will be shown.
  J is the last house to be shown, and it will be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and before M is shown.
  A: K cannot be shown after J because J must be shown in the evening.
  B: L must be shown after K, so it could be true.
  C: P could be shown at some time after J, so it could be true.
  D: The order of N and O is not specified, so it could be true.
  E: Both N and P could be shown at some time after K, so it could be true.
  Therefore, there are multiple choices that could be true.
  The most likely answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B") or Answer("C")
Response 3:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so we can eliminate option A.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so we can eliminate option E.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. This means that L cannot be the first or the last house shown. Therefore, L must be shown in the afternoon.
  Since J must be shown in the evening, P cannot be shown in the evening. Therefore, P must be shown either in the morning or the afternoon.
  Option B is possible since L can be shown at some time after J is shown.
  Option C is possible since P can be shown at some time after J is shown.
  Option D is not possible since there are only seven houses to be shown and both N and O cannot be shown after M is shown.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or C.
Action: Answer("B or C")
Response 4:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown after K and before M.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon.
  The sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening.
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible since K cannot be shown in the morning.
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown. This is not possible since J is shown in the evening and L must be shown after K and before M.
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown. This is possible since J is shown in the evening and P can be shown in the evening or afternoon.
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown. This is not possible since there are only seven houses and N and O are not part of the list.
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown. This is possible since K can be shown in the afternoon and both N and P can be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, the answer is E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 5:
Thought: 
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown. Therefore, L cannot be shown in the morning.
  The first and second houses to be shown will be shown in the morning. Therefore, J cannot be the first or second house to be shown.
  P is the last house to be shown, so P must be shown in the evening.
  Option A is not possible because K cannot be shown in the morning.
  Option B is possible because L must be shown at some time after K is shown.
  Option C is not possible because P must be shown in the evening, and J must be shown in the evening as well.
  Option D is not possible because N and O cannot be shown after M is shown.
  Option E is possible because both N and P can be shown at some time after K is shown.
  Therefore, the answer is either B or E.
Action: Answer("B or E")
Response 6:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown in the morning or afternoon.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  The third, fourth, and fifth houses to be shown will be shown in the afternoon, so K must be shown in the afternoon.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown, so L cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time before M is shown, so M must be shown in the evening.
  Therefore, J, K, and L must be shown in the afternoon, and M must be shown in the evening.
  P is the only house left, so it must be shown at some time after J is shown.
  Therefore, the answer is C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought:
  We know that J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be one of the first two houses shown in the morning.
  We know that K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  Therefore, we can rule out options A and B because K and L cannot be shown after J.
  We can rule out option D because it is not possible to show more than one house after the last house has been shown.
  We can rule out option E because N and P cannot be shown after K because K is not in the afternoon.
  The only option left is C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening, so J cannot be shown before the sixth house.
  K cannot be shown in the morning, so K must be shown in the afternoon or evening.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown, so L cannot be shown before the fourth house or after the sixth house.
  A: If K is shown at some time after J is shown, then K must be shown in the afternoon or evening, but K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, A is not possible.
  B: If L is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, B is not possible.
  C: If P is shown at some time after J is shown, then J must be shown in the morning, but J must be shown in the evening. Therefore, C is not possible.
  D: If both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown, then M must be shown in the afternoon or evening, but the sixth and seventh houses to be shown will be shown in the evening. Therefore, D is not possible.
  E: If both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown, then K must be shown in the afternoon or evening, and P must be shown in the evening. Therefore, E is possible.
  
Answer: Answer("E")
Response 9:
Thought:
  J must be shown in the evening.
  K cannot be shown in the morning.
  L must be shown at some time after K is shown and at some time before M is shown.
  We don't know the order of N, O, and P.
  
  A: K is shown at some time after J is shown.
    If J is shown in the evening, K cannot be shown in the morning. Therefore, this statement is false.
    
  B: L is shown at some time after J is shown.
    J must be shown in the evening and L must be shown after K but before M. Therefore, this statement could be true.
    
  C: P is shown at some time after J is shown.
    We don't know the order of N, O, and P. Therefore, this statement could be true.
    
  D: Both N and O are shown at some time after M is shown.
    We don't know the order of N, O, and P. Therefore, this statement could be true.
    
  E: Both N and P are shown at some time after K is shown.
    We don't know the order of N, O, and P. Therefore, this statement could be true.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 96 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: Three real estate companies—RealProp, Southco, and Trustcorp—are considering trading buildings with one another. Each building they own is categorized as either class 1, class 2, or class 3, depending on its approximate value: RealProp owns the Garza Tower (class 1), the Yates House (class 3), and the Zimmer House (class 3). Southco owns the Flores Tower (class 1) and the Lynch Building (class 2). Trustcorp owns the King Building, the Meyer Building, and the Ortiz Building, all of which are class 2. Each trade must be of exactly one of the following three kinds: Trading one building for one other building of the same class Trading one class 1 building for two class 2 buildings Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings
Question: If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, which one of the following must be true?
Choices:
  A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  D: Trustcorp owns the Garza Tower.
  E: Trustcorp owns the Zimmer House.
Response 0:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade a class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade a class 2 building for one class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then they will own one class 1 and two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, if Trustcorp trades a class 2 building for a class 1 building, then RealProp must own the class 1 building.
  Thus, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp can only trade class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Trustcorp must trade one of the King Building, the Meyer Building, or the Ortiz Building for two class 3 buildings.
  This also means that RealProp must trade one of its class 1 buildings for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp cannot trade the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building for two class 3 buildings because it would then own a class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade the King Building for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that RealProp must trade the Garza Tower for two class 2 buildings.
  Southco must trade the Lynch Building for two class 3 buildings.
  This means that Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building (the Garza Tower).
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade one class 2 building, the company must receive two class 3 buildings.
  The only company that owns class 3 buildings is RealProp.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings with RealProp.
  Southco cannot be involved in this trade because it does not own class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco must trade one of its class 2 buildings with Trustcorp, and it must receive a class 2 building in return.
  Trustcorp then has no more class 2 buildings.
  RealProp has a class 1 building, the Garza Tower.
  Therefore, RealProp must trade the Garza Tower with Southco for two class 2 buildings.
  Now Trustcorp has no class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
  The answer is B: Southco owns only class 2 buildings.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns three class 2 buildings.
  Trading one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings means Trustcorp will not own any class 2 building after the trade.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must have traded at least one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, so it must have traded with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp could not have traded one of its class 2 buildings for RealProp's class 1 building or two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, RealProp still owns a class 1 building.
  The answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade class 2 buildings with other companies is to trade one class 2 building for two class 3 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings to maintain ownership of only class 2 buildings.
  The only company that owns class 3 buildings is RealProp.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade with RealProp.
  If Trustcorp trades the Meyer Building or the Ortiz Building with RealProp, then Trustcorp will own a class 1 building.
  If Trustcorp trades the King Building with RealProp, then Trustcorp will still own only class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, the only conclusion that must be true is that Trustcorp owns the King Building. 
Action: Answer("D")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To trade a class 2 building, Trustcorp must receive two class 3 buildings.
  To receive two class 3 buildings, Trustcorp must trade one class 2 building and one class 1 building.
  Therefore, Trustcorp must trade one of the class 2 buildings for one of the class 1 buildings.
  This means RealProp must own a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The company must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp owns two class 3 buildings, so it could trade one of them for Trustcorp's class 2 building.
  This trade would leave Trustcorp with only class 3 buildings.
  Southco does not have any class 3 buildings to trade, so it must have made a trade with Trustcorp for a class 2 building.
  Therefore, C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp must be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  The only way to trade a class 2 building is to trade it for two class 3 buildings.
  Therefore, Trustcorp can only trade its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  If Trustcorp owns no class 2 buildings after some number of trades, then it must have traded all of its class 2 buildings for class 3 buildings.
  This means that Southco must have traded with Trustcorp at least once, because Southco is the only company that owns class 2 buildings.
  Therefore, C: Southco has made at least one trade with Trustcorp, must be true.
Action: Answer("C")
Response 8:
Thought: 
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  To get class 2 building, Trustcorp must trade their class 2 building with Southco's class 2 building.
  If Trustcorp trades their class 2 building with Southco's class 2 building, then Southco will have only class 1 and class 3 buildings.
  Southco has no class 2 building to trade with Trustcorp.
  So, Southco cannot trade with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco has not made any trade with Trustcorp.
  RealProp owns a class 1 building and two class 3 buildings.
  If RealProp trades their class 1 building with Southco's class 2 building, then RealProp will have only class 3 buildings.
  But, Southco has no class 2 building to trade with RealProp.
  So, RealProp cannot trade their class 1 building with Southco's class 2 building.
  Therefore, RealProp still owns a class 1 building.
  The Garza Tower is owned by RealProp and it is a class 1 building.
  Therefore, the answer is A: RealProp owns a class 1 building.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Trustcorp owns only class 2 buildings.
  Trustcorp must trade one of its class 2 buildings for two class 3 buildings.
  In order to do that, Trustcorp must trade with RealProp, which owns two class 3 buildings.
  RealProp must own a class 1 building to complete the trade with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, RealProp owns a class 1 building.
  Southco owns only one class 2 building, and it has not traded with Trustcorp.
  Therefore, Southco does not own only class 2 buildings, and it has not made any trades with Trustcorp.

### Temperature: 5.0 | Problem 97 of 100 ###
Topic: Law
Context: A concert promoter is filling the six slots at a benefit concert. The slots, from earliest to latest, are numbered slot one through slot six. The slots will be filled by six bands—Uneasy, Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, and Zircon. Each band will perform in just one slot. The order must meet the following constraints: Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots. Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
Question: If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, which one of the following could be true?
Choices:
  A: Uneasy performs in slot five.
  B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
  C: Wellspring performs in slot three.
  D: Zircon performs in slot two.
  E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Response 0:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of slots must be either:
  1. [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
  2. [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
  3. [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Xpert], [Zircon], [Uneasy]
  4. [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Wellspring], [Xpert], [Zircon], [Uneasy]
  From the options, only option C is possible. If Wellspring performs in slot three, then the order of slots must be either:
  1. [Yardsign], [Vegemite], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
  2. [Vegemite], [Yardsign], [Wellspring], [Zircon], [Xpert], [Uneasy]
  Action: Answer("C")
Response 1:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands from earliest to latest is Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Yardsign, Zircon, and Uneasy.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, the only possible slot for Uneasy is slot six and the only possible slot for Yardsign is slot one.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Vegemite cannot perform in slot six and Zircon cannot perform in slot one.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert. Therefore, Wellspring cannot perform in slot four or slot five and Zircon cannot perform in slot five or slot six.
  Therefore, the only possible slot for Zircon is slot two.
  The only possible slot for Wellspring is slot three.
  The only possible slot for Xpert is slot four.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot five and Vegemite cannot perform in slot three.
  The only option that could be true is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 2:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot one or two.
  If Wellspring performs in slot one, then Zircon must perform in slot two or three, which contradicts the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring performs in slot two.
  If Wellspring performs in slot two, then Zircon must perform in slot three or four.
  If Zircon performs in slot three, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, which contradicts the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot four.
  If Zircon performs in slot four, then Vegemite must perform in slot two or three, which contradicts the condition that Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot three.
  If Zircon performs in slot three, then Vegemite must perform in slot one, which satisfies the condition that Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, the answer is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 3:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the bands must be Vegemite, Wellspring, Xpert, Zircon, Yardsign, and Uneasy.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so it cannot be in slot five.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so it cannot be in slot five or six.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four, and Yardsign must perform in slot one or two.
  Zircon performs in an earlier slot than Xpert, so it cannot be in slot six.
  Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot two or four.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so it cannot be in slot four or six.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot two or three.
  If Vegemite performs in slot two, then Wellspring must perform in slot three, which is not possible since Wellspring must perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot three, and Wellspring must perform in slot two.
  The only valid option is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  This means that Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, this means that Uneasy must perform in either slot four or slot five.
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, this means that Yardsign must perform in either slot one, slot two, or slot three.
  Since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon, and Zircon performs in slot six, this means that Vegemite must perform in one of the slots one through five.
  Therefore, the only possible scenario is Yardsign in slot one, Vegemite in slot three, Wellspring in slot four, Zircon in slot six, Xpert in slot six, and Uneasy in slot five.
  The only choice that is possible is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 5:
Thought:
  Since Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, the order of Wellspring and Xpert must be either slot 2 and slot 3 or slot 3 and slot 4.
  If Wellspring performs in slot 3, then Zircon must perform in slot 1 or slot 2, which is not possible since Vegemite must perform in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Wellspring must perform in slot 2 and Xpert must perform in slot 3.
  Since Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, Yardsign must perform in slot 1 or slot 2. However, if Yardsign performs in slot 1, then Vegemite cannot perform in an earlier slot than Zircon. Therefore, Yardsign must perform in slot 2 and Vegemite must perform in slot 1.
  Since Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, Uneasy must perform in slot 4, slot 5, or slot 6.
  Since Zircon performs in a later slot than Wellspring, Zircon cannot perform in slot 2. If Zircon performs in slot 6, then Uneasy must perform in slot 4 and Xpert must perform in slot 5. If Zircon performs in slot 5, then Uneasy must perform in slot 6 and Xpert must perform in slot 4.
  Therefore, the possible order of the bands is:
  Slot 1: Vegemite
  Slot 2: Yardsign
  Slot 3: Xpert
  Slot 4: Uneasy
  Slot 5: Zircon or Wellspring
  Slot 6: Wellspring or Zircon
  The only choice that could be true is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 6:
Thought:
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then the order of the two bands is Wellspring, Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert, so the order of the three bands must be Wellspring, Zircon, Xpert.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite must perform in slot one or two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign must perform in slot one, two, or three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot four, five, or six.
  Therefore, the only option that could be true is B: Vegemite performs in slot three.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 7:
Thought: 
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, either Wellspring or Zircon performs in slot four and the other one performs in slot two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots, so Yardsign cannot perform in slot four.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon, so Vegemite cannot perform in slot four.
  Therefore, Zircon must perform in slot two and Vegemite must perform in slot three.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, so Uneasy must perform in slot five or six.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot six.
  The only remaining slot is slot one, which must be filled by Wellspring.
  The order of the bands is: Wellspring, Zircon, Vegemite, Yardsign, Xpert, and Uneasy.
  The only choice that could be true is E: Zircon performs in slot four.
Action: Answer("E")
Response 8:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot one or slot two.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot one or slot two.
  Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Yardsign cannot perform in slot four, slot five, or slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy cannot perform in slot one, slot two, or slot three.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Xpert must perform in slot six.
  Therefore, Zircon performs in slot two.
  Therefore, Vegemite performs in slot one.
  Therefore, Yardsign performs in slot three.
  Therefore, Uneasy performs in slot four.
  The only choice that is consistent with these constraints is D: Zircon performs in slot two.
Action: Answer("D")
Response 9:
Thought:
  Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert.
  Wellspring and Zircon each perform in an earlier slot than Xpert.
  Therefore, Wellspring and Zircon must perform in slots two and three in some order, and Xpert must perform in slot four.
  Vegemite performs in an earlier slot than Zircon.
  Therefore, Vegemite must perform in slot one, and Zircon must perform in slot six.
  Uneasy performs in one of the last three slots, and Yardsign performs in one of the first three slots.
  Therefore, Uneasy must perform in slot four or slot five, and Yardsign must perform in slot two or slot three.
  If Wellspring performs immediately before Xpert, then Yardsign must perform in slot two.

  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Therefore, the only candidates left to assign are Jaramillo, Kayne, Landon, and Novetzke.
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Yemen or Zambia.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia and Landon to Yemen.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Zambia, then Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen and Landon to Zambia.
  If Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, then Kayne cannot be assigned to that country.
  Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Landon (A).
Action: Answer("A")
Response 1:

  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Ong is assigned to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  There are only three countries and three ambassadors left to assign.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  If Kayne is not assigned to Venezuela or Yemen, then Novetzke must be assigned to one of these countries.
  If Novetzke is assigned to Yemen, then Kayne must be assigned to either Zambia or Venezuela.
  If Novetzke is assigned to Venezuela, then Kayne must be assigned to Zambia.
  If Kayne is assigned to Venezuela, then Jaramillo must be assigned to another country.
  Therefore, the possible assignments are Jaramillo and Landon (A), Jaramillo and Novetzke (B), Kayne and Landon (C), and Kayne and Novetzke (D).

  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  We know that Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, so Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen. 
  Therefore, Kayne must be assigned as ambassador to either Venezuela or Zambia. 
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, then Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador. 
  Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned as ambassadors to Venezuela and Zambia, respectively. 
  And, Landon must be assigned as an ambassador to Yemen. 
  Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Landon and Novetzke. 
  The answer is B: Jaramillo and Novetzke.

  If Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship, it is to Zambia.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  Therefore, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to one of the countries, and therefore Kayne must be assigned to one of the other countries.
  Landon must be assigned as ambassador to Zambia.
  Therefore, the other two ambassadors assigned could be Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Action: Answer("B")
Response 4:
Thought:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  Landon is assigned to Zambia if Landon is assigned to an ambassadorship.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then so is Kayne.
  Either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Since Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned to one of the ambassadorships, then Kayne must be assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Therefore, the possible ambassadors assigned are Jaramillo and Landon or Jaramillo and Novetzke.
  The answer is either A: Jaramillo and Landon or B: Jaramillo and Novetzke.
Action: Answer("A") or Answer("B")
Response 5:

  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne cannot be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Jaramillo is assigned as ambassador, Kayne must also be assigned as ambassador.
  If Landon is assigned as ambassador, it must be to Zambia.
  If either Kayne or Novetzke is assigned as ambassador, the other cannot be.
  Therefore, if Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, the only possible combination of ambassadors is Jaramillo and Landon.
  The answer is A: Jaramillo and Landon.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 6:
Thought:
  Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  If Kayne is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Ong can't be assigned as ambassador to Venezuela.
  Therefore, Novetzke must be assigned as ambassador to Yemen.
  If Novetzke is assigned as ambassador to Yemen, then Kayne can't be assigned as ambassador to any country.
  Therefore, Jaramillo must be assigned as ambassador to the remaining country, which is Zambia.
  The answer is A: Jaramillo and Landon.
Action: Answer("A")

  Therefore, Jaramillo and Kayne must be assigned as ambassadors to Yemen and Venezuela, respectively.
  Landon must be assigned as an ambassador to Zambia.
  Novetzke cannot be assigned to any of these countries, since either Kayne or Novetzke, but not both, is assigned to one of the ambassadorships.
  Therefore, the answer is A: Jaramillo and Landon.
Action: Answer("A")
Response 8:
Thought:
  If Ong is assigned as ambassador to Venezuela, Kayne is not assigned as ambassador to Yemen.

Response 2:
Thought: 
  Greyhounds are featured on day 1. 
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2. 
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1, so they can only be featured on days 2-6. 
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans, so they cannot be featured on days 4-6. 
  Therefore, Rottweilers can only be featured on days 1-3. 
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days, so Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 2. 
  From the above reasoning, we can infer that Greyhounds, Himalayans, and Rottweilers are featured on days 1, 7, and 3, respectively. 
  Therefore, Siamese, Manx, Newfoundland must be featured on days 2, 4, 5 in some order. 
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2. This violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days. 
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7. This violates the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. 
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4. This violates the condition that Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans. 
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5. This is possible since Manx can be featured on day 4 and Rottweilers on day 3. 
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6. This is possible since Newfoundland can be featured on day 5 and Manx on day 4. 
  Therefore, the answer is either D or E. 
Action: Answer("D or E")

  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
    If Siamese is featured on day 2, then Himalayans cannot be featured on day 2. 
    If Himalayans are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on day 3 and day 4.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on day 4, then they must be featured on day 5 and day 6.
    Therefore, on day 7, the only breed available to be featured is Manx.
    This violates the condition that no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    Therefore, A is not true.
    
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
    Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7 because no breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
    Therefore, B is not true.
    
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
    If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then they cannot be featured on day 3 or day 5.
    Therefore, Himalayans must be featured on day 2 and day 6.
    If Rottweilers are not featured on day 2, then they must be featured on day 1 and day 3.
    Therefore, on day 5, the only breed available to be featured is Manx.
    Therefore, C could be true.
    
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
    If Rottweilers are featured on day 5, then they cannot be featured on day 6.
    Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on day 1 and day 3.
    If Himalayans are not featured on day 3, then they must be featured on day 2 and day 4.
    Therefore, on day 6, the only breed available to be featured is Siamese.
    Therefore, D is not true.
    
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
    If Manx is featured on day 6, then Rottweilers cannot be featured on day 5.
    Therefore, Rottweilers must be featured on day 1 and day 3.
    If Himalayans are not featured on day 3, then they must be featured on day 2 and day 4.
    Therefore, on day 6, the only breed available to be featured is Newfoundlands.
    Therefore, E could be true.
    
  The only possible answer is C.

  Greyhounds are featured on day 1.
  No breed is featured on any two consecutive days.
  Any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7.
  Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, but not on day 1.
  Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, nor on any day that features Himalayans.
  
  A: Greyhounds and Siamese are both featured on day 2.
    If Siamese is featured on day 2, then Himalayans can't be featured on day 3, 4, 5, or 6, which means Himalayans will be featured on day 7, which contradicts the condition that any breed featured on day 1 is not featured on day 7. Therefore, this option is false.
  B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.
    Himalayans are not featured on day 1, so they can be featured on day 2, 3, and 4. Since no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days, Himalayans cannot be featured on day 5 or 6. Therefore, Himalayans will be featured on day 7, and since Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 7, this option is true.
  C: Rottweilers and Himalayans are both featured on day 4.
    If Himalayans are featured on day 4, then they can't be featured on day 5 or 6, and Rottweilers can't be featured on day 3 or 5. Therefore, this option is false.
  D: Rottweilers and Manx are both featured on day 5.
    If Manx is featured on day 5, then Himalayans can't be featured on day 4, 5, or 6, which means Rottweilers will be featured on day 4, and they can't be featured on day 3 or 7. Therefore, this option is false.
  E: Newfoundlands and Manx are both featured on day 6.
    If Manx is featured on day 6, then Himalayans can't be featured on day 4, 5, or 6, which means Rottweilers will be featured on day 4, and they can't be featured on day 3 or 7. Therefore, Manx cannot be featured on day 6. Therefore, this option is false.
    
  The only true option is B: Greyhounds and Himalayans are both featured on day 7.

  Answer choice C could be true if Himalayans are featured on days 2, 3, and 4 and Rottweilers are featured on days 1 and 6.
  Answer choice D cannot be true since Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans.

  If Himalayans are featured on exactly three days, then the other two breeds must be featured on four days.
  Greyhounds cannot be featured on day 2 or day 3 because no breed can be featured on any two consecutive days.
  Therefore, Greyhounds must be featured on day 4, 5, 6, or 7.
  If Rottweilers are not featured on any day that features Himalayans, then Rottweilers must be featured on day 2, 3, or 4.
  If Rottweilers are not featured on day 7, then they must be featured on day 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
  If Himalayans are not on day 1 and not on any day that features Rottweilers, then Himalayans must be featured on day 4, 5, or 6.
